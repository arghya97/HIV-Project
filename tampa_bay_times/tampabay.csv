Tampa Bay Times,Monthly shots control HIV as well as pills in 2 big studies,"SEATTLE (AP)  Monthly shots of HIV drugs worked as well as daily pills to control the virus that causes AIDS in two large international tests, researchers reported Thursday.

If approved by regulators in the United States and Europe, the shots would be a new option for people with HIV and could help some stay on treatment. Instead of having to remember to take pills, patients instead could get injections from a doctor or nurse each month.

""Some people will be thrilled"" at the convenience, said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an AIDS advocacy group.

Condoms remain the most widely available and inexpensive form of HIV prevention. Pills taken daily can keep HIV levels so low the virus is not transmittable to sex partners, but not everyone takes them as prescribed.

The shots could improve how well some people stick to treatment, perhaps helping those who have trouble remembering to take daily medicine to keep infection at bay.

There are other potential benefits. Getting shots at a clinic can lend more privacy to patients worried about the stigma of filling an HIV prescription at a pharmacy, said Dr. Susan Swindells of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, who presented results Thursday at an HIV conference in Seattle.

Cost will be an issue ""to make sure that everyone has access to this medication,"" said Dr. Hyman Scott of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, who was not part of the study. It's not clear how much the shots would cost. HIV pills can cost a patient up to thousands of dollars monthly , depending on the drug combination, insurance coverage, rebates and discounts.

And there will be concerns about patients missing a monthly shot, which could lead to drug-resistant strains of the virus. It will be ""a good option for some people,"" Scott said.

Whether monthly shots will also work to protect users' sex partners hasn't been studied yet, but there is reason to think they will, said experts at the conference.

The shots are a long-acting combo of two HIV drugs  rilpivirine, sold as Edurant by Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, and ViiV Healthcare's experimental drug known as cabotegravir.

ViiV Healthcare paid for the research. The drugmakers are seeking approval later this year in the United States and Europe.

One study included 616 people who were taking pills to treat their HIV infection. The other study enrolled 566 people who hadn't yet started treatment, so they first got pills to get the virus under control.

In each of the studies, half the participants switched to the shots while the rest stayed on pills. After nearly a year, 1 to 2 percent of people in both groups had traces of virus in their blood, whether they got shots or pills. That shows the shots worked as well as the standard pill therapy. A few people withdrew from the studies because of pain after the injections.

The studies were done in Europe and North America and in nations including Argentina, Australia, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Japan and Mexico.

""We don't have experience rolling out an injection in the real world,"" said Warren, the AIDS advocate. He said the next challenges will be how to deliver the shots and whether patients will remember to come back monthly. ""These are big questions.""

Tampa Bay Times,London man seems to be free of HIV in second such case,"SEATTLE (AP)  A London man appears to be free of the virus that causes AIDS after a stem cell transplant, the second success including the ""Berlin patient,"" doctors reported.

The therapy had an early success with Timothy Ray Brown, a U.S. man treated in Germany who is 12 years post-transplant and still free of HIV. Until now, Brown is the only person thought to have been cured of infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Such transplants are dangerous and have failed in other patients. They're also impractical to try to cure the millions already infected.

The latest case ""shows the cure of Timothy Brown was not a fluke and can be recreated,"" said Dr. Keith Jerome of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who had no role. He added that it could lead to a simpler approach that could be used more widely.

The case, published online Monday by the journal Nature, was presented Tuesday at an HIV conference in Seattle.

Brown sat in the front row, stood for a round of applause and shook hands with lead researcher Ravindra Gupta of University College London after Gupta presented details on the London patient.

The patient has not been identified. He was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and started taking drugs to control the infection in 2012. It's unclear why he waited that long. He developed Hodgkin lymphoma that year and agreed to a stem cell transplant to treat the cancer in 2016.

With the right kind of donor, his doctors figured, the London patient might get a bonus beyond treating his cancer: a possible HIV cure.

Doctors found a donor with a gene mutation that confers natural resistance to HIV. About 1 percent of people descended from northern Europeans have inherited the mutation from both parents and are immune to most HIV. The donor had this double copy of the mutation.

That was ""an improbable event,"" said Gupta. ""That's why this has not been observed more frequently.""

The transplant changed the London patient's immune system, giving him the donor's mutation and HIV resistance.

The patient voluntarily stopped taking HIV drugs to see if the virus would come back.

Usually, HIV patients expect to stay on daily pills for life to suppress the virus. When drugs are stopped, the virus roars back, usually in two to three weeks.

That didn't happen with the London patient. There is still no trace of the virus after 18 months off the drugs.

Brown said he would like to meet the London patient and would encourage him to go public because ""it's been very useful for science and for giving hope to HIV-positive people, to people living with HIV,"" he told The Associated Press Monday.

Stem cell transplants typically are harsh procedures which start with radiation or chemotherapy to damage the body's existing immune system and make room for a new one. There are complications too. Brown had to have a second stem cell transplant when his leukemia returned.

Compared to Brown, the London patient had a less punishing form of chemotherapy to get ready for the transplant, didn't have radiation and had only a mild reaction to the transplant.

Dr. Gero Hutter, the German doctor who treated Brown, called the new case ""great news"" and ""one piece in the HIV cure puzzle.""

The officials advised Barr against recusal from Robert Mueller's investigation into possible coordination between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. ""Consistent with that advice, General Barr has decided not to recuse,"" Kupec said in a statement. During his confirmation hearing in January, Barr sought to assuage concerns that he might disrupt or upend Mueller's investigation as it reaches its final stages.

The newly hired attorney, Junichiro Hironaka, is famous for winning acquittals in Japan, a nation where the conviction rate is 99 percent. Hironaka said Monday that he had offered new ways to monitor Ghosn after his release, such as camera surveillance.

Tampa Bay Times,China drafts rules on biotech after gene-editing scandal,"BEIJING (AP)  China has unveiled draft regulations on gene editing and other potentially risky biomedical technologies after a Chinese scientist's claim of helping to create gene-edited babies roiled the global science community.

Under the proposed measures released Tuesday, technology involving gene editing, gene transfer and gene regulation would be categorized as ""high-risk"" and managed by the health department of the State Council, China's Cabinet.

The measures follow assertions in November from scientist He Jiankui that he altered the DNA of twin girls born that month using a powerful new tool. The technology, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that's causing problems.

The revelation that it may have been used to conceive children elicited widespread outcry over the procedure's ethical implications. Researchers said He's actions exposed the twins to unknown health risks, possibly including a higher susceptibility to viral illnesses.

Gene editing for reproductive purposes is effectively banned in the U.S. and most of Europe. In China, ministerial guidelines prohibit research on embryos that ""violates ethical or moral principles."" Ethical guidelines published in 2003 say that gene editing is permitted for research, but that the experimental embryo cannot be nurtured for more than 14 days.

He Jiankui said he edited the babies' genes at conception in hopes of making them resistant to the AIDS virus, as their father is HIV positive. His lab was in Shenzhen, China's southern tech hub, and he recruited study participants through an AIDS advocacy group. He said his goal was to rewrite DNA before birth to make some children immune to HIV during their lifetime.

China immediately halted He's experiments after his announcement.

He also pursued international experts at Stanford and Rice universities, where he had done graduate studies work, and elsewhere, seeking advice before and during the experiment.

In an interview with The Associated Press the month before his project was publicized, the 34-year-old scientist said he believed gene editing of human embryos resulting in live births was legal in China because the country has no law specifically forbidding it.

China's official Xinhua News Agency reported last month that He had breached national guidelines and would be punished for any legal violations. Xinhua didn't say which laws He might have violated, but noted that he had fabricated an ethical review.

Along with the birth of the twins, another embryo yet to be born reportedly resulted from He's experiment. All three will remain under medical observation with regular visits supervised by government health departments, Xinhua said.

Late last year, China's education ministry sent notices to universities requiring self-checks on research related to gene editing. In an email, the ministry told the AP that it called on educational institutions to strengthen management of scientific research ethics and inspect research involving gene-editing technology.

Kehkooi Kee, a Tsinghua University researcher who conducts gene editing on stem cells, said the volume of paperwork he must now fill out has increased as a result of being subject to more checks.

""He (Jiankui) is an irresponsible scientist,"" Kee said in late December after the Education Ministry issued its notification. ""I don't even want to call him a scientist  he is an irresponsible man.""

While He's work was widely condemned by his fellow scientists in China, it has had repercussions for others studying gene editing. It has also become more difficult to get gene-editing research approved, Kee said.

""The industry will develop at a slower pace,"" Kee said. ""The government will be more cautious with research funds, and private organizations, such as charities and startups, will be less likely to invest.""",27/02/2019

“I didn’t want to feel like a victim,” he said. “It can be scary to talk to a doctor, especially if you’re transgender or identify as gay. But for me, I didn’t want to die. There are doctors out there that are willing to listen and learn.""

And some who still have a way to go.

Up to 12 percent of the U.S. population identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. But the LGBTQ community has long been underserved when it comes to health care, a new study by researchers at Tampa-based Moffitt Cancer Center concludes.

The Moffitt team surveyed 450 oncologists from 45 cancer centers that collaborate and share resources with the National Cancer Institute. The results showed that while most oncologists were comfortable treating lesbian, gay and bisexual patients, only about half were confident they knew those patients’ health needs. The number dropped to about a third for transgender patients.

Education gaps like that can put LGBTQ patients at risk for poorer outcomes when it comes to cancer treatment, said Matthew Schabath, the lead author on the study. Patients in that group also are less likely to have preventative screenings or health insurance, he said.

Results of the survey, said to be first of its kind in the nation, were published earlier this year in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. And they led researchers and doctors at Moffitt to create a new program to educate oncologists, and perhaps other front-line medical professionals, on how to better serve LGBTQ patients.

“When you think of personalized medicine, it means doctors aren’t just treating the disease, they’re treating the patient,” Schabath said. “It’s not just about the tumor, but that person’s whole body and soul. With a little more education, we’re hoping we can improve the health care experience for this community and provide a safe place.”

Moffitt is working with the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami and the UF Health Cancer Center at the University of Florida to create “cultural competency” training programs designed to improve general know-how about LGBTQ patients and the care they require. The training will be available in four 30-minute sessions and offered online.

In a pilot study of 20 Florida oncologists who completed the online course, only a third could answer more than 90 percent of the LGBTQ questions correctly. After the training, that one-third figure jumped to 85 percent, Moffitt researchers said.

“We focused on oncology providers, but there’s no data collected with any doctor on these patient groups at the federal level,” Schabath said. “It can be really hard to get to the patients to study them specifically. But we thought if we could get to the providers, and intervene there, that’s half the battle.”

So the larger issue is expanding to reach more people in the medical world, said Dr. Julian Sanchez from Moffitt.

“When I first got to Tampa, there was no real coordinated screening program for this community,” said Sanchez, who sees a relatively high number of gay patients in his gastrointestinal oncology practice at the center. Sanchez worked with the Hillsborough County Department of Health to create a program to screen patients for the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which can cause many of these types of cancer.

“One of the high-risk groups are gay men with HIV,” he said. “Because of that, screening programs should be more aggressive with this particular group, but there are no formal screening guides for gay men or lesbian women.”

Sanchez said other hospitals are doing a lot of work on this topic, but the biggest barrier is collecting data from patients that could be used to draft routine screening guides, which are key to catching and preventing cancer. It's the crucial information that’s collected during those first visits with a new a doctor, yet it’s not always easy to get.

“A lot of LGBTQ folks, especially the transgender community, have a difficult time accessing health care and talking about their bodies,” said Lucas Wehle, director of trans services at Metro Inclusive Health, a nonprofit health care organization that serves the LBGTQ community in Tampa Bay. “It can be even more difficult to feel safe when they don’t know their doctors’ background and how open they are.”

Added Sanchez: “There’s no easy way to find out who is gay and who is not gay. I could find out how many people in one zip code had stomach cancer, but I can’t find out how many of those with stomach cancer are gay or not.”

One way to improve the doctor-patient relationship would be to include cultural training in medical school, said Dr. Luke Johnsen, medical director at Metro Inclusive Health.

""We must educate doctors to ask these questions and address these issues, no matter their personal beliefs,"" he said. ""No doctor wants to miss a diagnosis. And if you're not asking all the right questions, you could.""

For Howe, the bump on his leg ended up being a cancerous liposarcoma. He went to St. Petersburg General Hospital for tests before being referred to Moffitt.

After chemotherapy and surgery, the lump was gone and Howe has been in remission for four years.

“It was a really dark and depressing time,” he said. “But the doctors and staff made me feel comfortable. I wasn’t ashamed to tell them I was gay.”

Tampa Bay Times,"Weeks after 2030 HIV pledge, report shows US headway stalled","NEW YORK (AP)  Three weeks after President Donald Trump announced a campaign to end the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030, new government data show that progress against the disease stalled recently.

After declining for several years, the estimated number of new HIV infections held about steady from 2013 to 2016, the latest available data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.

Health officials already knew HIV diagnoses had stopped declining. But that is a flawed measure, because in some cases people are not diagnosed until years after infection.

This latest CDC report estimates how many new infections happen each year, whether they're diagnosed or not. And it too shows a stall.

The new numbers show the government fell well short of previously set goals for reducing the spread of HIV by 2015, noted Dr. David Holtgrave, a longtime HIV expert who is dean of public health at the State University of New York at Albany.

What does it say about the 2030 goal? CDC officials said there's reason to be optimistic, but Holtgrave said the new report and other data do not bode well.

Barring new government funding of at least several billion dollars a year, ""it's extremely unlikely that will occur,"" Holtgrave said.

The report found:

An estimated 38,700 new HIV infections occurred in the United States in 2016.

Nearly 20,000 of those 2016 infections happened in the South. That's more than the combined total for the rest of the country.

New infections have been dropping among many groups of people, including black women, those younger than 24 and gay white men.

But there's no longer a decline in infections among people who inject drugs; it stopped declining in 2012. Experts believe the nation's opioid epidemic is to blame.

Infections are rising among black and Latino gay men who are ages 25 to 34. That number grew 65 percent from 2010 to 2016, offsetting decreases in other groups.

During his State of the Union speech earlier this month, Trump said he was launching a campaign to end HIV in the U.S. by 2030. Separately, federal health officials said the government hopes to reduce new infections by 90 percent over the next 10 years. The president did not say how much new money will be spent on the effort.

CDC officials have calculated that as many as 130,000 new infections were happening each year in the mid-1980s, when the nation's AIDS epidemic took off. The count fell to around 50,000 in the mid-1990s.

Tampa Bay Times,Kentucky man accused of Singapore HIV data leak jailed in US,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP)  A Kentucky man accused by the Singapore government of stealing a database of HIV patients has been jailed in the U.S. on federal charges of illegally possessing Singaporean identification documents.

Mikhy Farrera-Brochez of Winchester was briefly in federal court in Lexington on Wednesday. A federal grand jury will meet to decide if Brochez should be indicted on four U.S. charges related to the possession of the documents.

Last month, Singapore's health ministry accused Brochez of stealing and leaking a pre-2013 database of 14,200 people who were infected with HIV. The ministry says Brochez worked in Singapore as a lecturer before he was jailed for several drug and fraud-related offenses and deported last year.

Tampa Bay Times,Bill to allow needle exchange programs statewide advances,"A state Senate committee voted Tuesday to advance a proposal that would allow needle exchange programs statewide — with a key amendment that allows county commissions to decide if a program can open in their area.

SB 366 would expand an existing pilot needle exchange program in Miami-Dade, which allows injection drug users to trade dirty needles for clean ones at no charge and connects them to additional health resources like wound care and drug treatment. Expanding the program was has been proposed since the pilot was created in 2016, though those efforts have stalled in prior years.

State law currently does not allow legal needle exchanges elsewhere in the state. But this year, the proposed legislation has more backing in the Legislature, including a Republican co-sponsor in the House and the praise of House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes.

Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, the bill’s sponsor, told the Senate Health Policy committee Tuesday that the program is “more than just a needle exchange.”

“This has become a roving triage and health center for these people who do not have access,” he added, citing the program’s testing for HIV and hepatitis. “We’ve had hundreds of people into rehab and thousands of people saved with the Narcan given out.”

The amendment, which Braynon worked on with committee chair Sen. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, would change the requirements for a new needle exchange program so that a county commission’s approval is required for it to open. The previous version of the bill required simply that a potential exchange program notify the state Department of Health before commencing operations.

The bill also allows for counties to help subsidize programs. The current version in Miami-Dade, which is run by the University of Miami, receives no state or county funding.

Several lawmakers praised the work of the Miami-Dade program Tuesday before it was unanimously approved, including Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala.

He acknowledged that there had been concerns when the program started that it “may actually be creating more addiction by supporting the negative habits.” But he acknowledged several benefits resulting from the exchange program, including the reversal of overdoses and the reduction of discarded dirty needles.

“Everything that has happened over this three-year journey has demonstrated a very successful program,” he said. “It was certainly worth any risk that was perceived.”",19/02/2019
Tampa Bay Times,Judge halts Air Force's efforts to discharge airmen with HIV,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP)  A federal judge on Friday ordered the U.S. Air Force to temporarily stop discharging service members who are HIV-positive, ruling that it's working under a policy that is ""irrational"" and ""outdated.""

U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, issued her decision as a lawsuit moves forward against the U.S. Military.

Service members in the Air Force claim they're being discharged solely because of their HIV status and despite the recommendations of their doctors and commanding officers, who say they are fit to serve.

For now, the ruling keeps at least two HIV-positive men in the Air Force who were days and weeks away from being formally discharged.

Air Force policies had prevented the service members with HIV from deploying to places outside the U.S., such as Iraq and Afghanistan, without a waiver. That, in turn, resulted in the men being considered ""unfit"" for continued military service.

Because of advances in medicine and treatment for HIV, Judge Brinkema wrote that the disease ""does not impose unreasonable burdens on the military when compared to similar chronic conditions.""

She also said that HIV ""does not seriously jeopardize the health or safety of the service member or his companions in service.""

The judge added that the service members are likely to have some success in arguing their case as it moves forward.

The military has argued that the lawsuit is premature because the personnel have not explored all of their options within the military to fight being discharged. The military has also argued that such policy questions fall under the discretion of the federal government's executive branch.

The Department of Justice is representing the military. Spokeswoman Kelly Laco said its attorneys are reviewing the judge's decision. She declined to comment further.

The service members are being represented by lawyers from the LGBT rights groups Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN as well as the law firm Winston & Strawn.

The service members' attorneys said a judge's ruling against the military is rare, and framed the decision as a significant legal victory.

""These decisions should be based on science, not stigma, as today's ruling from the bench demonstrates,"" said Scott Schoettes, counsel and HIV project director at Lambda Legal.

Schoettes added: ""We still have to prove at trial that people living with HIV are deployable. But in the meantime they're not going to be able to get rid of any of those service members.""",16/02/2019
Tampa Bay Times,Nikki Fried: Delivering on Amendment 2’s promise — including smokable marijuana — requires all of Florida’s leaders working together.,"Twenty-seven months have passed since Floridians overwhelmingly voted for the right to access medical marijuana. But you wouldn’t know it by the way the previous administration obstructed access, slowed implementation, and denied the will of the people.

Nearly 200,000 patients in Florida have used this medicine for relief from terminal and terrible conditions. Yet many are still seeking relief from suffering — and they need access to the flower in its natural form.

Oils, tinctures, sprays and other forms of delivery have proven invaluable, but smokable medical marijuana can be life-changing. Physicians like Dr. Sanjay Gupta have touted the medicinal “entourage effect” of marijuana achievable only when consumed in whole plant form.

Cathy Jordan suffers with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Diana Dodson has HIV and neuropathy. For them — and countless others — smokable medical marijuana is the delivery mechanism they need. It makes their lives not only tolerable, but possible.

After trying other forms of medical marijuana, their doctors have recommended continuing to smoke the plant — and those doctors believe stopping could present irreversible problems.

These are just two of the stories we’ve heard. Yet each day, people across our state break the law just to get the treatment they need to stay alive.

This is absurd. And frankly, it’s just plain wrong.

I’m doing my part to right that wrong, by appointing the state’s first-ever cannabis director, and introducing new rules in the coming weeks on medical marijuana edibles and hemp production from which CBD products are derived. But delivering on Amendment 2’s promise requires all of Florida’s leaders working together.

Even though the appeal to the lawsuit blocking smokable medical marijuana hasn’t yet been dropped, I remain encouraged by Gov. Ron DeSantis’ intentions. I’m hopeful that House Speaker Jose Oliva, Senate President Bill Galvano and Florida lawmakers will quickly pass legislation delivering full relief to long-suffering patients.

Let me be clear — I understand reasonable restrictions, including ensuring only adults can access smokable medical marijuana, proper packaging and labeling, and limitations on dosing. But the details and treatment recommendations should be left up to physicians.

The 2016 amendment didn’t limit the forms of medical marijuana available to patients, or call for anyone other than doctors to make medical decisions. But what it did call for is a constitutionally guaranteed right to access medical marijuana “as determined by a licensed Florida physician” — not as determined by Tallahassee politicians.

We don’t see this kind of interference when doctors prescribe cholesterol drugs, antidepressants, opioids, cancer-fighting medicines or erectile dysfunction aids. That’s because people inherently understand that a patient’s course of treatment is a decision that belongs between a doctor and that patient.

Every patient is different, every human body is different, and every person responds differently to medical treatment. For many patients, the best method is smoking the natural flower, just as their doctor ordered.

Adults whose symptoms are relieved, and whose lives are made possible, by smoking medical marijuana in its whole plant form should be able to do just that — just as 6.5 million Floridians intended.

But Marie Kondo’s organization show has already been a win for thrift stores around Tampa Bay: Local Goodwills received an additional 5 million pounds of clothes, furniture, and other goods since her eight episodes debuted in January.

After we published a story about Kondo fever coming to Tampa Bay this week, several readers suggested donating to local thrift stores instead of big chains like Goodwill. We turned around and asked our Facebook and Twitter followers to weigh in with their favorite spots around town.

The following is a growing list of places to bring your stuff after you’ve cleaned out your closet and tackled the piles of junk in your garage. Many of these locations directly benefit people in Tampa Bay, whether it’s helping the homeless or supporting the LGBTQ community. You can also use it to plan your thrift store outings.

A few tips before you start your donation spree: Even though the KonMari method might involve getting rid of the items that no longer spark joy for you, make sure the goods you choose to give away are capable of sparking joy in someone else. In other words, don’t donate items that are ripped, stained, or unusable in any other way. You should also visit a store’s website before hauling your old stuff there — many locations offer free pickups, and most have restrictions on the types of items they accept.

Tampa Bay Times,"The FDA under Trump has approved 1,600 generic drugs. But many aren’t for sale yet","The Trump administration has been trumpeting a huge increase in FDA generic drug approvals the past two years, the result of its actions to streamline a cumbersome process and combat anti-competitive practices. But nearly half of those newly approved drugs aren’t being sold in the United States, Kaiser Health News has found, meaning that many patients are deriving little practical benefit from the administration’s efforts.

The administration’s aggressive push to approve more generics is designed to spur more competition with expensive brand-name drugs, and drive prices lower, President Donald Trump noted at a White House event last month. The Food and Drug Administration has approved more than 1,600 generic drug applications since January 2017 — about a third more than it did in the last two years of the Obama administration.

But more than 700, or about 43 percent, of those generics still weren’t on the market as of early January, a KHN data analysis of FDA and drug list price records shows. Even more noteworthy: 36 percent of generics that would be the first to compete against a branded drug are not yet for sale. That means thousands or even millions of patients have no option beyond buying branded drugs that can cost thousands of dollars per month.

MORE HEALTH NEWS: The flu is not that bad this year, experts say

“That’s shockingly high,” said former congressman Henry Waxman, who co-sponsored the 1984 law that paved the way for the generic approval process as we know it today. He said he’d like to know more, but suspects anti-competitive behavior is at least partly to blame and that revisions to the so-called Hatch-Waxman Act might be needed.

The approved generics that haven’t made it to American medicine cabinets include generic versions of expensive medicines like the blood thinner Brilinta and HIV medication Truvada. They also include six different generic versions of Nitropress, a heart failure drug, whose price spiked 310 percent in 2015.

Experts say a variety of factors are to blame. Generics sellers have fought for years against patent litigation and other delay tactics that protect brand-name drugs from competition. In recent years, vast industry consolidation has reduced the ranks of companies willing to purchase and distribute generics. And, in some cases, makers of generics obtain approvals and ultimately make a business decision to sit on them.

“It’s a real problem because we’re not getting all the expected competition,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview, adding that it will be difficult to solve because it has so many causes. It takes five generics on the market to drive prices down to 33 percent of the original brand-name price, according to an FDA analysis.

Without generics to lower drug costs, branded manufacturers can continue to increase their prices, at a rate of roughly 10 percent a year, said Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. “It makes health care costs go up across the board.”

Even if hospital patients don’t directly see high drug prices in their bills, the higher costs get passed to insurers, who pass them on as higher premiums, Knoer said. They also get passed to taxpayers, who pay for drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.

Consolidation on multiple tiers of the drug supply chain have changed the face of the generic drug market, warping supply and demand.

In some cases, key pharmaceutical ingredients are unavailable or a manufacturer doesn’t have the capacity to launch a product because it’s having difficulty meeting demand for existing products.

Manufacturing consolidation has dramatically reduced the production of injectable drugs, which are typically administered in a doctor’s office. This may be why 157 injectable generics that were approved in the past two years haven’t been brought to market.

Erin Fox, a pharmacist at the University of Utah who tracks drug shortages, said the KHN analysis of stalled generics “highlights that companies often have a lot of products ‘on the books’ but aren’t really making them.” A few generics on the list — like dextrose 10 percent injection, to treat patients with low blood sugar — would have been helpful to combat shortages the past few years. “This comes up with shortages a lot — it looks like there are more suppliers than there really are,” Fox said.

A lot can change between the time a drugmaker files a generic application with the FDA and the time it’s approved.

Some drugmakers that applied for generic approval years ago switched their attention to more profitable products. Novartis, for instance, recently sold a generics division run by Sandoz so Sandoz could focus on other drugs, including biosimilars, which compete with expensive biologic drugs made from living organisms.

“Some of these (generic) drug applications have been sitting six, seven, eight years,” said Robert Pollock, a former acting deputy director of the FDA’s Office of Generic Drugs who now works for Lachman Consultants. By the time it’s approved, a generic can fall out of favor because patients taking the branded version reported new side effects, or because a more effective branded drug was approved.

For some generic manufacturers, there’s money to be made by waiting. Brand-name drugmakers will pay them to keep their products off the market as part of a tactic sometimes called “pay for delay.” The Federal Trade Commission estimates that such deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion a year.

The number of these potentially anti-competitive settlements decreased from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015, according to the latest FTC report. Still, Gottlieb said he hopes to crack down on such tactics. The first generic to take on a branded drug is granted 180 days of exclusivity before the second and third generics can be approved, giving those products a clear advantage.

“We don’t like that companies are able to just park (a generic for) 180 days while they cut a deal not to come to market,” Gottlieb said, adding that with help from Congress he hopes to force companies to forfeit exclusivity if they don’t launch on time.

In some cases, Gottlieb said, generic drugmakers wait until they’ve stockpiled a number of newly approved generics and have landed a contract with a purchaser before bringing their medicines to market.

These bundled contracts are secretive, so not much is known about them, but it means companies are filing generic applications just for the option of introducing generics, said health care economist Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University. They’ll wait until the most strategic time to launch, which could be after the competition shakes out, leaving them as “the last man standing,” Conti said. Then they can launch and hike the price.

To be sure, the FDA under Gottlieb’s leadership has taken steps to increase generic competition, from shaming brand-name drugmakers for blocking generics to publishing documents to help manufacturers win approval more easily. But approval doesn’t necessarily spur competition.

“We used to say it was all about getting in — once you got approval from the FDA, then you could go to market,” said Chip Davis, CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, the trade group for makers of generic drugs. The biggest challenges his members face is that there aren’t enough companies purchasing drugs, Davis said. Consolidation has led to three large buying groups covering 90 percent of the market, according to a Drug Channels Institute report. So, if you’re the fourth or fifth generic, you may have no one left to sell to.

Yet another barrier relates to how drug middlemen select the drugs they’ll cover under industry formularies, which determine what products insurance plans will cover. In some cases, middlemen known as “pharmacy benefit managers” have made it clear they don’t have room on their formularies for another generic. Or they do, but they give branded drugs preferential treatment with lower copays, hurting the generic’s market share.

Barriers to entry are lower under Gottlieb’s FDA than they’ve been in years past, Conti said, and regulations can help foster competition. But, she said, “they can only do so much.”

Methodology

To identify approved drugs that have not reached the market, KHN used the FDA’s Orange Book database — as of Jan. 2 — to identify drug applications approved in 2017 or 2018. We then searched the FDA’s online National Drug Code directory for billing codes for the drugs associated with each application as of the same date. To account for a possible lag, we supplemented this list with a more complete billing code directory that we obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. It includes codes with expected future launch dates that don’t appear in the online version.

According to experts, a billing code doesn’t necessarily mean a drug is on the market. However, every drug on the market needs a list price for reimbursement. We provided a list of application numbers and billing codes to information technology firm Connecture, which then told us whether each one was active, inactive or had no list price as of Jan. 17.

If an application had at least one billing code with a list price attached, we counted it as on the market, even if other billing codes did not have list prices.

Sometimes, a single generic application can have multiple approval dates. If one of these approval dates occurred in the past two years, we included it in our analysis.

To determine whether a drug was a first generic, KHN used the FDA’s 2017 and 2018 lists of first generics as of Jan 2.

Tampa Bay Times,Daystarter: National Signing Day recap; ideal forecast for opening of Florida State Fair; meet Florida’s new pot czar,"Catching you up on overnight happenings, and what to know today.

• Prepare to endure another nice day. It’ll be in the upper 50s to low 60s in the morning with patchy fog, but will turn into another sunny, warm and clear day, according to the National Weather Service. Highs will be from the upper 70s to low 80s, then drop back down into the 50s at night.

•Here are the top things to do today in Tampa Bay including the opening of the Florida State Fair, Tyler Perry brings his Madea character on a farewell tour and Sing Out! Tampa Bay returns.

• We have now entered that sweet spot in the year when the weather is nice, the crowds are lighter and SeaWorld and Universal are cranking up popular festivals with free concerts to generate foot traffic. Here’s a preview of Universal’s Mardi Gras and the SeaWorld Seven Seas Food Festival, both opening on Saturday with special food and concert lineups over the next few months.

• President Donald Trump pledged in Tuesday’s State of the Union to “eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.” Steve Contorno reports that if the president follows through on his promise, Florida’s rising number of AIDS and HIV cases will make it the epicenter of that fight.

• Louis C.K. performed the first of six sold-out shows at Side Splitters Comedy Club on Wednesday and received a standing ovation after his hour long set. There were no protestors, no phones allowed and no jokes involving the Parkland school shooting, though the comedian did allude to the outrage he stirred up with a previous joke on that topic, as well as his own admitted sexual misconduct. Christopher Spata details the the appearance.

• It’s been a good week for mayoral candidate Jane Castor. A local poll put her out in front of her six opponents by more than 30 points. Now a powerful national political action committee dedicated to electing women to office announced its support for her on Thursday. Emily’s List, which spent $110 million in the last election cycle to help elect a record 34 women to Congress, endorsed Castor as its choice for Tampa mayor in the coming March 5 municipal election.

• In a state where elections have brought recounts that last weeks and where 29 electoral votes can depend on a decimal point, much attention has been paid to how Florida’s overall electorate could change after November. That’s when voters approved Amendment 4, a ballot measure that restored the right to vote to most people who had served out sentences for felony convictions. What would 1.2 million potential new voters mean to perhaps the purplest big state? But an earlier test for Amendment 4 comes on March 5 in Tampa. Read more from Langston Taylor.

• There are more pressing issues facing Florida, but this is the most pressing question today: Will Gov. Ron DeSantis ride the giant slide at the Florida State Fair today? Christopher Spata writes that, if there’s one thing associated with the Governor’s Day Luncheon, it’s that annual photo opportunity when Florida politicians take a slip down the giant slide. If you're headed there today, here's a primer on the gut-busting food options available this year.

• Florida has its first pot czar: Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried announced that Holly Bell, a Nashville consultant and banker who worked to help service the hemp and cannabis industry, will be the state’s first director of cannabis — a $110,000 per year job. But Samantha Gross reports that those who work in the cannabis industry expressed disappointment that Fried picked an outsider from Florida and questioned her experience in the field.

• Investor Ben Mallah recently paid $16.5 million for the Belleair Shore home of former Philadelphia Phillies slugger Ryan Howard, the record price for a residential property in the Tampa Bay area. Here’s what else $16.5 million could have bought.

• St. Petersburg’s skies have been studded with construction cranes, but the rapid development is giving rise to tension between those intent on preserving the old and others who consider that advocacy a violation of property rights. Waveney Ann Moore has the details.

• For the latest in Florida politics, make sure to check The Buzz.

• James Cordier seemed a man on top of his game. He lived in a bayfront mansion with travertine floors and an infinity pool. He had a sleek office in a downtown Tampa skyscraper. Jeff Vinik, owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning, and nearly 300 other wealthy clients trusted him to make smart decisions with their money. But then, as Susan Taylor Martin reports, he lost his clients at least $150 million.

• Check out the Times online Business page for the latest on the economy, jobs, real estate, retail and workplace culture.

• The Madeira Beach City Commission has made the news once again: City Commissioner Nancy Oakley has resigned, days after being fined by the state ethics commission for sexually harassing a former city manager by licking his face and groping him. Read how this strange case is finally wrapping up.

• It’s been more than a decade since Hillsborough County Fire Rescue officials first warned that the county’s booming population growth would exceed their ability to provide emergency services. But the alarm was sounded once again at Wednesday’s Hillsborough County Commission meeting. Anastasia Dawson reports that union officials and dozens of firefighters urged commissioners to build at least one new fire station a year over the next 25 to 30 years to meet the needs of rapidly growing communities.

All the recruiting news from National Signing Day are on the Tampa Bay Times online Sports page with the latest ranking of the Bulls, Gators, Seminoles and Hurricanes classes.

• The Gators only needed four recruits to lock up their 2019 class Wednesday thanks to a prolific early period in December. But Mari Faiello reports that Florida beat out SEC rivals Georgia and Alabama to land two of those players, giving coach Dan Mullen reason to be excited about this class by beating out the two teams that played in the SEC championship.

• Florida State failed to sign a quarterback for the second year in a row, but Seminoles coach Willie Taggart said he has a plan to solve his lack of depth at the game’s most important position. But as Matt Baker reports, Taggart wasn’t willing to discuss that plan just yet at his signing day news conference.

• University of South Florida coach Charlie Strong announced he landed 19 players on signing day. But Joey Knight reports that Strong said he’ll be relying on something else to boost the Bulls’ talent level this offseason: the NCAA transfer portal.

• Columnist Martin Fennelly profiles one of the Tampa Bay area’s top recruits on signing day: Hillsborough High School’s Terence Doston, who signed to play football and baseball for West Virginia.

Tampa Bay Times,"Read, watch: President Trump's State of the Union address","Text of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, as delivered and provided by CQ:

–––

Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans. We meet tonight in a moment of unlimited potential as we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic break-troughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now gathered in this great chamber, hoping we will govern not as two parties, but as one nation.

The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda, it's the agenda of the American people. Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers, to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure, to reduce the price of health care and prescription drugs, to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics if only we have the courage together to seize it.

Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.

This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the great crusades, the allied liberation in Europe. On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes, Private First Class Joseph Riley, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker and Sergeant Herman Zeitchiek.

Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag, Buzz Aldrin.

Thank you, Buzz. American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.

In the 20th century, America save freedom redefined the middle class and when you get down to it, there's nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America.

Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this next great American adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the new 21st century, amazing quality of life for all of our American citizens is within reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.

But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good.

Together we can break decades of political stalemate, we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight I ask you to choose greatness.

Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over two years, since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been seen before. There's been nothing like it.

We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something which almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are just getting started.

Wages are rising at the fastest pace if decades and growing for blue collar workers who I promised to fight for, they're growing faster than anyone else thought possible. Nearly five million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.

The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Not even close.

Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. African-American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country. 157 million people at work.

We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate tax or death tax, as it is often called, on small businesses, for ranches and also for family farms.

We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty. And to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed very importantly right to try. My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.

PHOTOS: President Trump’s State of the Union address

Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations. And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And now for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.

After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world. Our military is the most powerful on Earth by far — and America is again winning each and every day.

Members of Congress, the state of our union is strong. That sounds so good. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. When Friday it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone, almost double the number expected.

An economic miracle is taking place in the United States and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way. We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases years and years waiting. Not right.

The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country. Now is the time for a bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that that's possible. In the last Congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic V.A. reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed V.A. Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.

And just weeks ago both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. They said it couldn't be done.

Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22 years she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice. She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.

In June, I commuted Alice's sentence, when I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right. Alice is with us tonight and she is a terrific woman.

Terrific. Alice, please. Thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much, Alice. Inspired by stories like hers, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.

This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives nonviolent offenders re-enter society. Now states across the country are following our lead.

America is a nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law Clerk and mentored many of his fellow inmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew.

Welcome home. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland and secure our very dangerous Southern border. Now is the time for congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large organized caravans are on the march to the United States.

We have just heard that Mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our Southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught.

This is a moral issue of the lawless state of our Southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well-being of all America. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who follow the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our nation in countless ways. I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.

Tonight I'm asking you to defend our very dangerous Southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration.

Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, gates and guards. Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration, reduce jobs, lower wages, overburden schools, hospitals that are so crowded that you can't get in, increase crime and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate. It is actually very cruel.

One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.

Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states and they almost all come through our Southern border.

Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands. But until we secure our border, they are going to keep streaming right back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.

I have gotten to know many wonderful angel moms, dads and families. No one should have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure. Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, her parents, Gerald and Sharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien.

They were in their 80's and survived by four children, 11 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison and please stand. Few can understand your pain. Thank you. And thank you for being here.

Thank you very much. I will never forget and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.

In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 killings or murders. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes, ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.

When Elvin was a boy, he and his family came to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, he told his dad he wanted to become a special agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scores of international sex trafficking.

Elvin says that if I couldn't make sure these young girls get their justice, I've really Done My Job. Thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation. And more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.

We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement. And I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE. Thank you.

My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the Southern border. It includes the humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.

In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall. But the patrol wall never got built. I will get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these agents will tell you where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime, one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.

So let's work together, compromise and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.

You weren't supposed to do that. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the work force than ever before.

Don't sit yet. You're going to like this. And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.

That's great. And congratulations. That's great. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.

To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount, reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, so bad. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.

Therefore we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us. I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.

I have great respect for President Xi and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.

Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA. For years politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried until now.

Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven't had delivered to for a long time. I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words, made in the U.S.A.

Tonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.

I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill. And I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a necessity.

The next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it, and we'll stop it fast.

I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients finally.

We should also require drug companies, insurance companies and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against H.I.V. and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once distant dream within reach.

My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States within 10 years. We have made incredible strides, incredible. Together we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond. Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind, the fight against childhood cancer.

Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday — Hi, Grace. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what happened. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately she began radiation treatment. At the same time she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered, I love her and still love her, with tears in her eyes and hung up a poster that read, ""Last day of chemo.""

Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies. We will ask for $500 million to fund this critical life-saving research to help support working parents. The time has come to pass school choice for America's children.

I'm also proud to be the first president to include in my budget for a nationwide paid family leave so every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.

There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with the life upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies, who will never share their love and dreams with the world and then we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth, to defend the dignity of every person. I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in a mother's womb.

Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth, all children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.

Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. Finally.

For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO. But now we have secured over the last couple of years more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO allies. They said it couldn't be done.

As part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state of the art defense missile system and under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability.

While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. Been going on for many years. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty or INF Treaty. We really have no choice. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding China and others or perhaps we can't, in which case we will outspend and out innovate all others by far.

As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home. Nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months. If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong-un a good one. We will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.

Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people and their noble quest for freedom and we condemn the brutality of their regime whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.

Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free and we will stay free.

Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face and have for many years is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principle, realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel and proudly opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.

Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East. As a candidate for president, I loudly pledged a new approach.

Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria just two years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these blood-thirsty monsters. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.

I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach, if possible, a political settlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.

In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and focus on counter-terrorism. And we will, indeed, focus on counter-terrorism. We don't know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace and the other side would like to do the same thing. It's time.

Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. Thank you, Tom.

My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror, the radical regime in Iran. It is a radical regime. They do bad, bad things. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.

And last fall we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vial poison of antisemitism or those who spread its venomous creed.

With one voice we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Swat Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gun fire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. And he was very successful.

Timothy has just had his 12th surgery and he's going in for many more. But he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful. Thank you very much.

Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. Not only did he escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. (Audience sings ""Happy Birthday."") They wouldn't do that for me, Judah.

Judah says he can still remember the exact moment nearly 75 years ago after 10 months in a concentration camp when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the absolute worst. Then his father cried out with joy, ""It's the Americans, It's the Americans.""

Thank you. A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight was a prisoner at Dachau. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. For me, Joshua recalls, the American soldiers were proof that God exists and they came down from the sky, they came down from heaven.

I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side by side here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you.

When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurdling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.

They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America, they did it for us. Everything that has come since, our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice, all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.

Think of this Capitol. Think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.

Here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii, from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona, from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.

Together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress, look at the opportunities before us. Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await.

Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.

This is the time to reignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. this is our future, our fate, and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny. That one nation under God must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world.

Thank you, God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much.",06/02/2019
Tampa Bay Times,Trump vowed to ‘defeat AIDS’ in his State of the Union. Florida is ground zero.,"President Donald Trump pledged in Tuesday’s State of the Union to “eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.”

If he follows through on that promise, then Florida will be the epicenter of that fight.

Reported cases of AIDS and HIV are on the rise in this state. The Miami area — where 1 in 1,000 people have HIV — has the highest rate of new diagnosis of any metro area in the country, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The Orlando area ranks sixth on that list, Jacksonville is ninth and the Tampa Bay region cracked the top 25.

The Trump administration hopes to cut new cases of HIV by 75 percent in five years and 90 percent by 2030. To do so, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will focus on the 48 counties that accounted for half of the country’s 38,000 new cases of HIV in 2017.

Seven of those counties are in Florida, more than any other state except California. The counties are: Pinellas, Hillsborough, Orange, Duval, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward.

RELATED: HIV is on the rise in Florida and young people don’t seem to care

Federal health officials hope to stop new infections by working within those communities to identify people who have unknowingly contracted the disease and improve access to needle exchanges, pre-exposure drugs and other resources for at-risk populations.

The approach may differ in each community, agency officials said. They will also work with seven states where there are alarming new rates of the disease among rural residents and native tribes.

“It is not one size fits all and we realize that,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on a phone call with reporters Wednesday.

Florida, a fast-growing and diverse state, poses unique challenges, officials with health agencies and the Center for Disease Control acknowledged on that call. The population fluctuates by the season. Millions of visitors stop by for a few days or a few months, and some may spread or contract the virus while here.

The state attracts retirees seeking sunshine and low taxes, unaware that some senior communities have become problematic for their sexual transmitted diseases. There’s also been an alarming increase of HIV cases — 20 percent over the last decade — among Floridians in their 20s. Among both demographics, condom use is down.

And each Florida region has its own characteristics and communities, said Michael Ruppal, executive director of the AIDS Institute, a national advocacy and research organization based in Tampa. Preventing the spread of AIDS in St. Petersburg is different than in Orlando.

“The personalities in those seven counties are so different,” Ruppal said. “It’s like going into different countries. You can’t treat disease like a cookie cutter.”

It’s difficult to gauge how serious Trump is about tackling this problem. Trump’s declaration Tuesday night was a brief aside in an hour-long speech. “Together, we will defeat AIDS in America,” he said, before pivoting to child cancer research.

It was also a surprising focal point for a president who last year proposed cutting tens of millions of dollars from federal HIV and AIDS programs. Still, on Wednesday, administration officials couldn’t say how much Trump’s 2020 budget would dedicate to tackling this public health crisis. They promised the investment would be significant and it wouldn’t take away from other public health programs.

Ruppal said the goals laid out by Trump’s administration to stop the spread of HIV are realistic. And he is cautiously optimistic that the president will follow through when he proposes his budget later this month.

“He barely said anything but the fact that he made a commitment in public at the State of the Union, it’s positive,” Ruppal said.

It will be up to Congress, though, to approve any new funding for HIV programs. Both of Pinellas County’s representatives in Washington — Republican Gus Bilirakis of Palm Harbor and Democrat Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg — said they would welcome new investments in fighting AIDS. Sen. Rick Scott did as well.

“More attention is needed to combat a condition that is 100 percent preventable and often stigmatized,” Crist said. “As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, increased funding requests from the administration would receive my full support.”







",06/02/2019
Tampa Bay Times,"Trump to call for unity, face skepticism in State of Union","WASHINGTON — The White House says President Donald Trump will call for optimism and unity in Tuesday's State of the Union address, using the moment to attempt a reset after two years of bitter partisanship and deeply personal attacks.

But will anyone buy it?

Skepticism will emanate from both sides of the aisle when Trump enters the House chamber for the primetime address to lawmakers and the nation. Democrats, emboldened after the midterm elections and the recent shutdown fight, see little evidence of a president willing to compromise. And even the president's staunchest allies know that bipartisan rhetoric read off a teleprompter is usually undermined by scorching tweets and unpredictable policy maneuvers.

Still, the fact that Trump's advisers feel a need to try a different approach is a tacit acknowledgement that the president's standing is weakened as he begins his third year in office.

The shutdown left some Republicans frustrated over his insistence on a border wall, something they warned him the new Democratic House majority would not bend on. Trump's approval rating during the shutdown dipped to 34 percent, down from 42 percent a month earlier, according to a recent survey conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the president would use his address ""to call for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution.""

""He's calling for cooperation,"" she said, adding that Trump will point to examples of where this has happened on his watch. Officials said the president is also expected to highlight infrastructure, trade and prescription drug pricing as areas in which the parties could work together.

RELATED: Three fathers of Parkland victims will attend Trump’s State of the Union

But Washington's most recent debate offered few signs of cooperation between Trump and Democrats. Under pressure from conservative backers, Trump refused to sign a government funding bill that did not include money for his long-sought border wall. With hundreds of thousands of Americans missing paychecks, Trump ultimately agreed to reopen the government for three weeks to allow negotiations on border security to continue.

With the new Feb. 15 funding deadline looming, Trump is expected to use his address to outline his demands, which still include funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He's teased the possibility of declaring a national emergency to secure wall funding if Congress doesn't act, though it appeared unlikely he would take that step Tuesday night. Advisers have also been reviewing options to secure some funding without making such a declaration.

""You'll hear the State of the Union, and then you'll see what happens right after the State of the Union,"" Trump told reporters.

The president's address marks the first time he is speaking before a Congress that is not fully under Republican control. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who won plaudits from Democrats for her hard-line negotiating tactics during the shutdown, will be seated behind the president — a visual reminder of Trump's political opposition.

In the audience will be several Democrats running to challenge Trump in 2020, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Another Democratic star, Stacey Abrams, will deliver the party's response to Trump. Abrams narrowly lost her bid in November to become Georgia's first black governor, and party leaders are aggressively recruiting her to run for Senate.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer previewed Democrats' message for countering Trump, declaring Monday, ""The number one reason the state of the union has such woes is the president.""

While White House officials cautioned that Trump's remarks were still being finalized, the president was expected to use some of his televised address to showcase a growing economy. Despite the shutdown, the U.S. economy added a robust 304,000 jobs in January, marking 100 straight months of job growth. That's the longest such period on record.

Trump and his top aides have also hinted that he is likely to use the address to announce a major milestone in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. Despite the objections of some advisers, Trump announced in December that he was withdrawing U.S. forces in Syria.

In a weekend interview with CBS, Trump said efforts to defeat the IS group were ""at 99 percent right now. We'll be at 100.""

U.S. officials say the Islamic State group now controls less than 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) of territory in Syria, an area smaller than New York's Central Park. That's down from an estimated 400 to 600 square kilometers (155 to 230 square miles) that the group held at the end of November before Trump announced the withdrawal, according to two officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

However, a Defense Department inspector general report released Monday said the Islamic State group ""remains a potent force of battle-hardened and well-disciplined fighters that could likely resurge in Syria"" absent continued counterterrorism pressure. According to the Pentagon, the group is still able to coordinate offensives and counteroffensives.

Administration officials say the White House has also been weighing several ""moonshot"" goals for the State of the Union address. One that is expected to be announced is a new initiative aimed at ending transmissions of HIV by 2030.

Trump's guests for the speech include Anna Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman whose life sentence for drug offenses was commuted by the president, and Joshua Trump, a sixth-grade student from Wilmington, Delaware, who was allegedly bullied because of his last name. They will sit with first lady Melania Trump during the address.",05/02/2019
Tampa Bay Times,"With a new name and more space, Metro Inclusive Health aims to expand its reach","For the last 26 years, Metro Wellness and Community Centers has offered HIV and other health care services to the LGBTQ community and those with limited or no insurance.

In 2019, the Pinellas-based nonprofit hopes to expand its reach in Tampa Bay with a new name and a revamping of its headquarters.

Metro is now known as Metro Inclusive Health, which officials say better represents its mission. The organization will host a grand opening of its recently renovated 47,000-square-foot headquarters and clinic, located in the Historic Kenwood District in downtown St. Petersburg, on Feb. 9. In addition to an expanded clinic and pharmacy, the center has a new event hall and a co-working office space.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: HIV is on the rise in Florida and young people don’t seem to care

“In our founding days, we served many that were not included in traditional health care channels,” said Metro CEO, Lorraine Langlois. “Since then, inclusivity has been a guiding theme for the organization in many ways.”

That means the group expects its upgraded quarters to attract new patients with insurance, in addition to growing its services to the uninsured, the underinsured, and people in the LGBTQ community.

“We wanted to create a space where every patient would feel comfortable, from someone who has stable income and health insurance to a patient who does not,” said Brian Bailey, vice president of marketing and communications at Metro. “Every patient who comes to Metro for appointments and has insurance is giving back to the organization so we can serve those who don’t have insurance.”

In 2018, Metro served more than 18,000 patients from four centers across Tampa Bay, and the demand continues to surge, Langlois said. So the group spent the last year looking for ways to support that growth.

Federal grants, once a reliable revenue stream for health care services, “have dried up,"" Langlois said. However, Metro plans to apply this year to become a federally qualified health center, a reimbursement designation from national health agencies like Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.

The co-working and event hall space will serve as an experimental new revenue stream for the organization. The appeal, Langlois said, comes from the center's central Kenwood location, where several apartment complexes are currently under construction on the same block.

The 10,000-square-foot hall offers on-site parking, presentation and lighting technology and an outdoor area with activities. When the space isn't rented, Metro will use it to house its programs serving LGBTQ youth, seniors and others.

The co-working space will allow professionals to rent a desk or office space, and offer conference amenities.

Metro partnered with CAN Community Health, a Sarasota-based HIV health care nonprofit, to purchase and renovate the St. Petersburg facility. Funding also came from individual donors.

In addition to the St. Petersburg improvements, Metro has some big plans for 2019. The organization is renovating its clinic in New Port Richey and has plans to expand in Tampa. It also hopes to launch a telemedcine app that patients can use to schedule appointments and order prescriptions, Langlois said.

Tampa Bay Times,Wednesday’s letters: Don’t be petty when stemming climate change is at stake,"Climate heat on Castor panel | Jan. 27

Act on climate, not pettiness

Tampa should be honored that our member of Congress has been appointed chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. For climate activists, the revitalization of the committee is a promising indication that climate legislation is an immediate priority in the new Congress, and Rep. Kathy Castor is a proven climate advocate. My biggest hope is that the partisan, often ugly, rhetoric that dominates the current political sphere can be kept out of this important issue. The criticism from the left that membership will include lawmakers with a less than perfect donor record is not helpful. Is it at all beneficial to shame a member of one’s own party for not being “green enough”? Shouldn’t we be excited that the committee is back in existence?

The left, overall, has led the environmental charge while being stymied on climate legislation with frustratingly bitter obstruction for years. Democrats are now finally positioned to get meaningful legislation through the House. It’s destructive to the cause to attack those who are clearly climate champions. Besides, aren’t we out of time for pettiness?

Bill would have students learn alternatives to climate change, evolution | Jan. 29

Round and round is the world

Sen. Dennis Baxley says, “If you look at the history of human learning, for a long time the official world view was that the world was flat.” In point of fact, the learned people of ancient Greece, Persia and Egypt knew the world was round. Columbus’ argument with the scientists of his time was not whether the Earth was flat or round but over its circumference. He thought it was about a third smaller than the conventional wisdom of his time. He was wrong. The only folks who thought the world was flat were the uneducated. Evolution is a fact, and intelligent design is a thinly disguised form of creationism.

Health director confronted | Jan. 25

In defense of a health official

My wife and I have spent a number of fun evenings at Hamburger Mary’s in Ybor City, and I’m sorry that venue is closed. That said, I have known and worked with Dr. Doug Holt of the Hillsborough County Health Department for 30 years, and my colleagues in public health and I consider him one of the best public health leaders in the country. His strong sense of duty, ethics, fairness and kindness are special. He has successfully led our county through the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other infectious disease outbreaks with skill and excellent judgment and has been an outstanding resource for our faculty and students at the USF College of Public Health.

Tampa Bay Times,Hamburger Mary's owner blasts Hillsborough health official after Hepatitis A scare,"TAMPA — No one actually got sick at Hamburger Mary’s Bar and Grill in Ybor City, county health officials say, which they temporarily shut down in November due to a hepatitis A scare.

But the owner, staff, patrons and drag queens of the beloved restaurant say the emotional and financial damage has already taken its toll. The chain’s flagship restaurant on E Seventh Avenue will not reopen.

One by one, they addressed the Hillsborough County Commission on Thursday to complain about the way the Florida Department of Health’s Hillsborough County Director, Dr. Douglas Holt, handled the Oct. 24 news that a restaurant worker had tested positive for hepatitis A.

Holt was on hand to deliver a report on an “epidemic” of hepatitis A patients in counties along the Interstate 4 corridor. But Hamburger Mary’s owner Kurt King said it was Holt’s televised interviews about his restaurant that caused it to fail after nine years in Ybor City. He still has locations in Brandon, Clearwater and St. Petersburg, however.

“He’s destroyed my business; he’s destroyed me,” King said. “A lot of our employees lost their houses, they lost their cars; they lost everything. I’ve lost everything.”

Emotions ran high as county commissioners questioned Holt about the way he handled the public health matter. He told Commissioner Les Miller that he would “do anything ... to help Hamburger Mary’s reopen “post haste.”

The comments that sparked the most concern were those Holt made to WFTS-Ch. 28, which his critics called discriminatory, misleading and homophobic.

“If you’re going to fish, you need to go where the fish are,” Holt said in the interview. “Half of (patients) report having drug use, the others would be a mixture of homelessness and particular sexual activities. The classic category is men having sex with men.”

The county said there were 11 cases of hepatitis A in Hillsborough in 2017. That increased to 84 in 2018, a jump of 664 percent.

In his report to commissioners, Holt said the comments were taken out of context. While gay men are at risk of the disease, the doctor said, hardly any of the Hillsborough patients who tested positive for hepatitis A were of that demographic.

Instead, the epidemic actually impacted white, non-Hispanic men ages 30 to 50, the doctor said. He ran down the three risk factors: “Drug use, recently incarcerated and homelessness.” Those factors were found in about 90 percent of reported cases, the doctor said.

“When you speak for 45 minutes I don’t know why the media does what they do,” Holt said. “My comments were to what am I doing about it, how am I communicating, how am I treating it.”

He added: “People who know me I have been an infectious disease physician for 35 years, I’ve taken care of patients when we didn’t have AZT (a medication to treat HIV.)”

The doctor also vowed to rebuild his department’s relationship with the LGBTQ community: “We need their trust and I’m doing my best to repair the damage and to regain that trust.”

But the publicity and fallout from the hepatitis A scare were too much for the restaurant to bear, said Sonia Torres, who performs as “Esme Russell” to help support her aging parents. After the announcement, crowds dwindled from 200 to just 10 or so patrons, she told commissioners. The restaurant’s closure slashed 70 percent of her family income.

“Being an entertainer is one of my only forms of making money,” she said. “I don’t want to sell drugs. I don’t want to be on the street. I want to pay my bills respectfully and live an honorable and decent life.”

Commissioner Mariella Smith said the comments were reminiscent of the “fear mongering” made against the LGBTQ community during the AIDS epidemic. She warned that the way the hepatitis A scare was handled threatened to reopen old wounds.

“Coming from the department of health it seems to make an official announcement that LGBT-owned businesses are suspect as likely carriers of this contagious disease,” Smith said. “We have to be mindful of our own local context as well and we have a very recent history of the pendulum swinging back and forth between granting civil rights to LGBT people and then taking those rights away ... “

She told the commission they must “keep moving forward and keep a watchful eye out for any signs of officials calling out LGBT people and their businesses publicly.” Smith called that “dangerous in ways that could divide our community with fear and discrimination.”

King cited his closed restaurant’s contributions to the community over the past two decades, such as donating an estimated $2.1 million to charitable organizations, sponsoring the Gasparilla Softball Classic and a gay World Series tourney. Now he said he is pondering taking legal action against health officials.

“I’ve done a lot for this community,” he said. “I wish the health department would have stood with me and helped me through this instead of what they’ve done to me.”",27/01/2019
Tampa Bay Times,Needle exchange in Florida gains new support to go statewide,"MIAMI -- The sun is setting in Overtown on a balmy Thursday in January, and Eddy Suarez Jr. is trying to make a yellow light.

For the last several months, the University of Miami doctor has pulled the weekly van-driving shift in the downtown Miami neighborhood, where he trades injection drug users’ old needles for fresh ones, as part of the IDEA Exchange, the county’s pilot syringe-exchange program.

On this trip, Suarez is stopping under a nearby overpass for two participants who are waiting to exchange needles nearby. It’s been a hectic few months for IDEA, which has used the exchanges as a conduit to providing other care. In October, they worked with local health officials to persuade several people to go into treatment as Miami city hall politicians sought to move out a group of homeless people living under one of the highway overpasses in the neighborhood.

“This was the shooting gallery, right here,” Suarez says, as he drives the van by an abandoned lot under the overpass. The bright orange caps of needles speckle the ground even in dim light. “All this was just people shooting up.”

The program, in that month, “got 20 people into treatment in 30 days,” he recalled. They drove out daily — stocked with needles, cookers and sterile equipment — to exchange syringes and offer HIV and hepatitis C testing and to help those looking for treatment get care. “The floodgates were open.”

With the new year starting, Suarez and other advocates are gearing up again to take that model statewide. Bills have been filed in Tallahassee for the upcoming legislative session to expand the simple exchange program that advocates say has combated the spread of HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis through dirty needles and saved lives.

The program signed up its 1,000th participant in January and has reported at least 1,075 overdose reversals, according to a letter sent to the Department of Health. It has also collected more than a quarter million syringes, and despite the rise of opioid-related deaths statewide, Miami-Dade’s toll has dipped.

But in the two years that program has been running, lawmakers have declined to expand the program.

Advocates are hoping now that this may be their year. The House bill is being co-sponsored by a Republican, and Speaker Jose Oliva, who hails from Miami-Dade, visited the clinic in December and signaled his approval.

Last year, the push to expand the needle exchange program statewide stalled because of opposition from the Florida Sheriffs Association, which expressed concerns about some sheriffs and county leaders who would not have control over needle exchange programs opening up in their areas.

This year’s bills — sponsored by Reps. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, and Rene Plascencia, R-Orlando, in the House and Sen. Oscar Braynon II, D-Miami Gardens, in the Senate — included “opt-out” language for counties that don’t want the program. Matt Dunagan, a spokesman for the sheriff’s association, said the group is still reviewing the new legislation and has not yet taken a position on the bill.

Advocates are also stressing the program’s cost efficiency in a year in which Oliva, newly-minted as speaker, is pressing for more price transparency and curbing healthcare costs.

Oliva “was intrigued by the out-of-the-box thinking going on,” he told the Times/Herald after visiting the clinic. “Equally impressive was the shoestring budget this program operated under, proving, once again, that more money for a problem is usually not the solution to that problem.”

He praised the program as “cost-effective and solution-centric, two great attributes for success.”

Oliva’s position is a far cry from the opposition needle exchange first faced when Dr. Hansel Tookes, who has fostered the program, first traveled to Tallahassee in 2012 to get an agreement to start the pilot.

Lawmakers were concerned then that needle exchanges would simply encourage more drug use. But the pilot became more appealing as opioid deaths continued to rise, and users turned increasingly to needles after Florida shut down “pill mills” starting in 2011.

They agreed to let Miami-Dade run a five-year pilot program, buoyed by arguments it was preventive care that could preclude high costs for treating diseases transmitted by dirty needles and that it could connect users to treatment and disease testing.

But the way the law is written means needle exchanges are still not legal in the rest of the state. In other places like Tampa Bay, advocates are still waiting for the ability to swap dirty needles for safe ones.

Matt Zweil, who wants to start an exchange program there, has been unable to do so without breaking the law. Instead, he has distributed naloxone and held regular trainings at methadone clinics in the area in lieu of trading needles.

Not legally having an exchange, he said, “keeps us from having places that people who are actively using are coming where we can reach them and connect them to services. They do everything in secret, and there’s nothing but shame and criminality associated with the use of injection drugs, and so they die.”

His naloxone distribution program has helped reverse at least 105 overdoses in the last year. But “Narcan doesn’t stop people from getting HIV and AIDS,” he said. “The massive financial consequence of that is hard to overstate.”

Zweil also added that the statewide needle exchange bill still would not provide state funding if it passes, describing it as “the thinnest sort of compromise to open the door to needle exchange.” He has so far paid to run his program out-of-pocket but said he would apply for federal grants or other funding if the bill becomes law.

In Miami-Dade, the program has become a mainstay for participants who regularly look for the van on its rounds in Overtown and other neighborhoods. The clinic’s three-trailer outpost in Overtown is filled regularly with a half-dozen UM medical students volunteering to provide wound care, draining abscesses that develop from repeated injections, and connecting users to resources about treatment or sterile use of needles.

Suarez, the UM doctor, and his colleague, Elisha Ekowo, have become a regular sight under the overpasses, where some of the homeless residing there will call them by name.

On their recent visit, Chris Rivera, 34, stops by the van to exchange a needle, spurred by word-of-mouth about the program from other users. Rivera, who has used heroin since his teens, says he’s tried twice to get to treatment before, but it hasn’t stuck.

He worked in roofing and construction until he started using again late last year, and became homeless about a month ago: “I fell right back into the same cycle.”

But he’s heard positive things about the program and says he wants to eventually get back into treatment. His motivation: his 5-year-old daughter, who he doesn’t want to see him dealing with addiction.

He signs up to participate in the needle exchange and rides the van back to the clinic a few blocks away, where he’s tested privately for HIV.

Before he leaves, he stands outside the clinic, watching the medical students chat between abscess draining and waiting for more participants to stop by. He says he’ll be back, before he walks away.",27/01/2019
Tampa Bay Times,HPV test emerging as an alternative to the Pap smear,"At one time, cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer death for women the United States.

And while that rate has fallen significantly over the last 40 years, detection methods have mostly stayed the same. Until now.

Gynecologists have been screening for cervical cancer for years through routine Pap smear exams by testing for potentially precancerous and cancerous cells in the cervix.

But clinicians are shifting to screening specifically for the human papillomavirus, or HPV, an infection that causes nearly all cervical cancers, to improve accuracy as they work to prevent the disease.

More than 79 million Americans are currently infected with a strain of HPV, according to the Cleveland Clinic. And roughly 14 million people are newly infected every year.

About 80 percent of sexually active people, both men and women, are infected with HPV at some point in their lives, but most rarely ever know it or are affected in any way. Still, there are 12 strains of HPV that are known to cause cervical cancer in women. The HPV vaccine aims to protect women and men from those strains.

Because of the dramatic rise of HPV, screenings for the infection are becoming more popular. That has prompted the birth control delivery company, Nurx, to launch an at-home HPV screening test this month. Women receive the test in the mail and can perform it at home. It requires a vaginal swab, and the collection is sent in the mail to be tested, said Jessica Horwitz, the company's clinician director.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Should Florida law require school kids to get the HPV vaccine?

“If the results are positive, we recommend the patient follow up with a provider in person,” she said. “But the standard guidelines are if the test is negative, you don’t need to repeat the test for the next three to five years.”

Nurx is an app-based service where users can already sign up to have birth control or the HIV-prevention medication, PrEP, sent to them in the mail. The company charges a $15 shipping fee and bills insurers for pharmacy services, though patients can pay out of pocket.

Patients don't necessarily need to have a doctor's prescription to use the service. Horwitz said Nrux is a kind of ""telemedicine"" service that aims to provide greater access to care to people who may not be able to see a doctor.

Access has become a concern as numbers reveal that too many women have been slow to get screenings.

A study published this month in the Journal of Women’s Health shows a decline in screenings for women in the 21 to 29 age range for cervical cancer and HPV. Just over half of the women in that group were current on their screenings in 2016, a number the study’s author found “acceptably low.”

“The traditional medical system is slow to catch on,” said Horwitz, the Nurx executive. “It’s a bit polarizing. But the rate of women coming in for routine exams is lower and lower.”

In another recent twist, researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa have developed a new test that can help guide cervical cancer screenings for women who test positive for HPV. According to a National Cancer Institute study, this new HPV test can more accurately predict whether an HPV-positive woman would develop cervical cancer within five years compared to a Pap test, where the results can vary.

The test uses a dual-stain method to measure the presence of two proteins that in combination have shown to be an accurate and dependable way to detect pre-cancerous cells. In the study, HPV-positive women who had a negative result on the dual-stain test had a low risk of developing cervical cancer over the next five years. Therefore, researchers concluded these women could wait three years before being screened again.

RELATED: Yes it’s awkward, but more dentists should talk to patients about oral cancers and sex

This screening method is still too new to be put into everyday practice among gynecologists, but it’s a step in the right direction to earlier detection and prevention, said Dr. Robert Wenham, the chair and director of research in the department of gynecologic oncology at the Moffitt.

""Testing methods have stayed stagnant for a very long time,"" Wenham said. ""A lot of times results from a Pap smear can come back a little funny, and we just don't know how quickly pre-cancerous cells can change.”

Tampa Bay Times,Critics seek Hillsborough transgender-rights rules for Pasco schools,"Dozens of people flooded the Pasco County School Board meeting this week to demand the district change the way it deals with transgender students.

It marked the fourth board meeting at which a growing number of speakers have come to call for a policy that requires everyone use restrooms and locker rooms according to their born biological sex, among other requests. The issues came to the fore after a Chasco Middle School physical education teacher refused to supervise a boys locker room while a student identifying as male was permitted to change there.

Several on Tuesday encouraged board members to look to Hillsborough County schools for direction.

“In Hillsborough County, we faced this same issue two years ago,” said Terry Kemple, a Brandon-based conservative Christian activist who unsuccessfully ran for Hillsborough’s board in 2014. “Our school board came to a sensible conclusion.”

Unfamiliar with their neighboring district’s approach, some Pasco district officials called their counterparts to inquire. They learned that Hillsborough’s formal policy and its practical implementation are perhaps more open than the Pasco method that has generated so much criticism.

In 2016, people representing several conservative churches signed petitions and spoke at Hillsborough board meetings, complaining about the district’s willingness to accept students' gender identification.

The district followed up by implementing universal restrooms on every campus, for any student seeking privacy to use.

It also trained school leaders to be more sensitive in the way it approaches students, including instructions to call students by the names and pronouns of their choice — something many of the Pasco critics have argued should not occur.

Hillsborough went even further, advising principals to protect students' privacy regarding gender identity, noting that some of the children might not have told their parents. The people attending the Pasco board meetings have demanded more parental involvement, blasting the district’s procedures of shielding students and demanding parental consent for students to participate in clubs and other activities.

The Hillsborough School Board never went so far as to adopt a proposal to expand its anti-harassment policy to include protections based on “gender expression.” But it mentioned gender identity and sexual orientation — things that Pasco’s current rule does not specify. Compare the two current policies:

Hillsborough: “Any form of discrimination or harassment can be devastating to an individual’s academic progress, social relationship and/or personal sense of self-worth. Therefore, the School Board will not discriminate nor tolerate harassment in its educational programs or activities for any reasons, including on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age (except as authorized by law), national or ethnic origin, political beliefs, marital status, handicapping condition, sexual orientation, gender identity, or social and family background (collectively protected characteristics). Additionally, it will not discriminate in its employment policies, harassment and bullying policies, and practices.”

Pasco: “The Superintendent will vigorously enforce its prohibition against discriminatory harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex/gender, disability (including HIV, AIDS, or sickle cell trait), pregnancy, marital status, age (except as authorized by law), religion, military status, or genetic information which are classes protected by State and/or Federal law (collectively, “protected classes”) (hereinafter referred to as unlawful harassment), and encourages those within the District community as well as third parties, who feel aggrieved to seek assistance to rectify such problems.”

Pasco school district leaders have taken no steps to change their current policy or procedures, which have looked at every individual case separately. Board attorney Dennis Alfonso stressed that the district is keeping close tabs on state and federal guidelines and legal precedents, which remain in flux as the Trump administration rewrites rules and the courts consider appeals of cases from as nearby as St. Johns County, where the school system was barred from establishing strict single-gender restrooms.

Alfonso said the district’s overarching policy aims to provide safeguards for all groups. Superintendent Kurt Browning made clear his goal is to provide a safe environment for all students.",17/01/2019

Tampa Bay Times,Subvert the will of the voter? It’s a Florida thing.,"A heavy dose of skepticism greeted Gov.-elect Ron DeSantis earlier this month when he claimed that the implementation of Amendment 4 should be delayed until lawmakers can pass a bill finalizing it that he can then sign.

For supporters of the ballot measure, which would restore voting rights of most felons who have served their sentences, any delay tactic was a ploy to dilute the measure, at best, or kill it outright, at worst.

Who can blame the skeptics for assuming the worst?

Check out these examples of ballot referendums with high hopes that passed by wide margins, only to run aground in their execution.

Class size

The issue: On Nov. 5, 2002, Floridians voted to amend the state Constitution to require that every school allow only a certain number of students in each class.

Advocates had complained for years that Florida's class sizes were ballooning.

The measure specified maximums of 18 students in prekindergarten through third grade, 22 students in grades four through eight and 25 students in grades nine through 12. It required the state, not school districts, to shoulder the cost of building more classrooms and hiring more teachers. And it said the maximums were to be in place by 2010.

The vote: The amendment passed with 52 percent voting yes. That was before a change that later required 60 percent approval to change the Constitution.

The rollout: The amendment faced pushback from Day 1. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush and other Republican leaders feared the cost would ""blot out the sun"" and launched the first efforts to undercut it.

But in addition to being expensive, the amendment was hard to implement. Public schools never know how many kids are going to show up on the first day, and many students move around during the year. The new law forced districts to add teachers and move kids around after the school year started.

Rather than comply, many districts found it cheaper to pay penalties for violating the maximums.

As the years wore on, advocates of all stripes — including some who originally supported the amendment — questioned whether smaller class sizes were worth the trouble and expense, and whether they really helped kids learn.

Early efforts to derail the amendment included legislative resolutions to get it repealed or limited to the lower grades. They failed. After that came efforts to relax the strict class-by-class maximums, which failed in the Legislature and at the polls.

In 2011, the Legislature reduced the number of classes subject to the class size limits, and allowed districts to account for late-arriving students by letting classes temporarily exceed the maximum by only a handful of kids.

Two years later, lawmakers allowed class sizes to be calculated using a schoolwide average instead of looking at every classroom. Dozens of districts have taken advantage of that provision to avoid penalties, and many class sizes are larger as a result.

Over the last 16 years, the state says $43 billion has been spent on class size efforts.

Environmental land-buying

This photograph, which appears in the 2012 Florida Forever calendar, was taken by Mac Stone in the Green Swamp, which feeds water to the Hillsborough River.

The issue: On Nov. 4, 2014, Floridians voted by an overwhelming margin for Amendment One, which amended the state Constitution to require $10 billion in tax money over the next 20 years for environmentally sensitive land and protecting wildlife and water resources.

Florida once led the nation in environmental land purchases. Despite the political popularity of preservation efforts, the Legislature sharply cut the money for land buying, preferring to spend it on other priorities.

Then in 2011, in his first year in office, Gov. Rick Scott cut it out completely. Scott's administration then spent three years dismantling the state Department of Environmental Protection division in charge of assessing and acquiring environmental land, according to former state employees.

Formally known as the Florida Water and Land Conservation Amendment, Amendment 1 aimed to return Florida to its days of prolific land preservation. It required no new taxes. Instead, it called for one-third of the documentary tax paid on real estate transactions to be spent on conservation spending programs.

Backers of Amendment One such as Audubon Florida, the Sierra Club and 1000 Friends of Florida collected 68,000 petition signatures to get it on the ballot. Leaders of the petition drive boasted that they had seen no organized opposition.

The vote: Amendment One passed with 75 percent of the people who went to the polls voting yes.

The rollout: The weakness in Amendment 1 was that its implementation relied on the very people it was intended to rebuke, state lawmakers. At the first legislative session after passage, lawmakers earmarked a mere $17.4 million for the acquisition of parks and wildlife habitat, a far cry from the $300 million that Amendment 1 backers had intended.

About half of the Amendment 1 money would be spent on projects and programs that were historically paid for out of other parts of the budget. One part of the spending plan was specifically aimed at helping an agricultural giant named Alico hang onto a state contract. Legislative leaders contended that those things met the somewhat vague requirements of Amendment 1's language.

Gov. Scott, who during his reelection campaign had called for spending $150 million a year on environmental programs, did not endorse Amendment 1, and did not fight for it in the Legislature. Instead, his environmental agency proposed selling off hundreds of parcels of surplus parks and preserves to finance more land-buying. The list of potential surplus properties created such an uproar that the Scott administration scuttled the idea without selling a single parcel.

Environmental groups sued, accusing legislators of thwarting the will of the people. Attorneys for the House and Senate argued that the amendment was vague enough to allow them to spend the money on things like the management of already-purchased conservation land, staffing of agencies or buying easements to save working farms and ranches.

In June, the judge hearing the case ruled against the Legislature and in favor of the environmental groups. Legislators have taken the case to the First District Court of Appeals. Meanwhile the attorney representing the environmental groups, David Guest of Earthjustice, said that when he read the language of the felon voting measure, Amendment 4, he began screaming.

""It's exactly the same"" as Amendment 1, he explained.

Medical marijuana

The issue: On Nov. 8, 2016, Florida voters approved Amendment 2, which legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Florida already had a medical marijuana law in place from 2014, but it limited use of cannabis to those who were terminally ill and had less than a year to live. And it only allowed products with low levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana.

This new measure allowed physicians to ""recommend"" medical marijuana as treatment in the form of edibles, electronic vaping, tincture sprays and oils, and in pill form. And it opened up cannabis use to patients who suffered from a longer list of ailments: cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV, AIDs, PSD, ALC, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain.

The vote: The amendment passed with 71 percent approval from voters.

The rollout: While Amendment 2 officially went into effect in January 2017, the delays that followed prompted critics to accuse the state of dragging its feet. Legislators approved implementation measures during the last day of a special session.

They opened the marijuana industry in the state to a select group of companies that were in charge of producing marijuana, manufacturing it, selling it in their own dispensaries and delivering it. Patients would have to wait 90 days before receiving marijuana products. They also had to submit a form, a doctor's note and pay $75 to receive a license from the state.

The state health department opened the ""Office of Compassionate Use"" to oversee it all, but officials were quickly overwhelmed after 100,000 patients signed up. Meanwhile, fewer than 2,000 doctors in the state got licenses to give cannabis recommendations.

Critics say the long waits and regulatory hurdles have delayed patients' access to treatment they need.

At the same time, municipalities began to pass their own ordinances, limiting where marijuana companies could open their dispensaries.

A Tallahassee judge recently ruled that the law passed to implement the amendment was unconstitutional because it both required marijuana operators to grow, process and distribute related products while also capping the number of marijuana licenses. About 20 lawsuits still swirl around the issue, including many petitions for licenses from parties that were denied one, and a challenge to the state's ban on smoking medical marijuana.",26/12/2018

Tampa Bay Times,Federal prosecutor: Ex-Pasco school officials preyed on children,"UPDATE: U.S. District Judge Virginia Hernandez Covington has sentenced William Napolitano to life in prison.

***

The school bus manager and the assistant principal were trusted Pasco County education professionals who authorities say shared an interest in sexually abusing children.

Prosecutors say William Napolitano and Kyle Ritsema knew each other long before their separate arrests on federal child pornography charges. Both resigned from the school district after their arrests.

A memorandum filed in advance of Napolitano’s sentencing, set to take place Thursday in the Sam M. Gibbons Federal Courthouse in Tampa, alleges the pair did more than exchange illicit images of kids. They preyed on them, too.

“The two constantly traded war stories about sexually abusing children and conspired to have group sex with minors,” the document states.

Ritsema, 35, was an assistant principal at Cypress Creek Middle/High School in Wesley Chapel before his February arrest. A criminal complaint alleges he admitted to making pornographic images of a teenage boy. A change of plea hearing in his case is scheduled for Dec. 21.

Napolitano, also 35, was arrested in 2017 and signed a plea agreement in August in a separate case, admitting to conduct that Assistant U.S. Attorney Francis D. Murray described in a sentencing memo as “an ongoing campaign to have sex with minors,” and a long-term predatory sexual relationship with a boy who was 15 when they met.

He took pornographic pictures of the boy without his knowledge and shared them with others, the memo states. The images became part of Napolitano’s vast child pornography collection, which the memo said featured victims as young as infants being subjected to sadistic sexual abuse.

Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for Napolitano. They believe he victimized other children.

“Napolitano’s mind has descended to depths of depravity that are hard to fathom,” Murray wrote. “He poses a constant and perpetual threat to society. His freedom and autonomy are fundamentally incompatible with the safety of children in our community and elsewhere.”

Napolitano was a transportation manager with Pasco County schools when he was arrested in October 2017. He had worked for the district more than a decade, starting as a school bus driver in 2004. Before that, he was a child care worker for the YMCA in New Port Richey, according to the memo.

Federal agents became aware of him during a separate investigation into child pornography that was being traded through Kik, an instant messaging application. An undercover agent had several sexually explicit conversations with a person who used the screen name “routemeup.” The name was registered to a “William Snyder,” but an investigation linked the internet protocol address to Napolitano.

Investigators later raided his New Port Richey home. On his iPhone, a laptop and a DropBox account, they found hundreds of pornographic images. Prosecutors described the collection as “staggering,” both for its size and the depravity of its content.

“Napolitano admitted having a deep interest in this type of material,” the memo states. “Particularly pornography involving infants and toddlers.”

Text messages stored on Napolitano’s phone included conversations with other people, wherein he boasted about his exploits with teenage boys, according to the memo. One of those he chatted with was Ritsema.

“Napolitano and Ritsema were well aware of each other’s positions and corollary obligations to protect and nurture children in the community,” the memo states.

It quotes one exchange from June 2014, in which the pair planned to watch child pornography together.

“Please don’t tell anyone,” Ritsema wrote, according to the memo. “It’d be all over the news. I won’t say anything either!”

“Our secret dude,” Napolitano replied.

Ritsema was aware that Napolitano was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a teenage boy, the memo states, and they discussed Ritsema taking part.

The boy was 15 and a student in a local school when he met Napolitano on a social networking application, according to records. Starting in 2014, Napolitano engaged in an “ongoing enticement” of the boy, having sexual conversations with him and soliciting nude photos. On several occasions, he sexually abused the boy in his car while parked in public places, the memo states. Another time, Napolitano sneaked into the teen’s bedroom, which he shared with two younger brothers, and sexually abused him there.

The memo noted that Napolitano also had “a bizarre fascination with intentionally acquiring and spreading HIV.”

In a conversation with law enforcement, the victim recalled one occasion after he turned 18 in which Napolitano took him to a hotel to meet two other men for intercourse. The boy said he didn’t participate because one of the men appeared to be ill.

Prosecutors detailed “strong circumstantial evidence” that Napolitano molested other children. In his text messages, he made references to having sexually abused at least five other young victims, according to the memo. They include a 13- or 14-year-old boy from Tarpon Springs, a 16-year-old boy from East Lake, and another teen Napolitano claimed to have sexually abused at a Wesley Chapel golf course.

Federal agents have tried to identify those other victims. They scoured school yearbooks, questioned teachers, and interviewed his cellphone contacts but were unsuccessful.

“Napolitano was responsible for protecting the safety of children in the community as they commuted to and from school each day,” the memo states. “He instead preyed on them. His conduct has shaken public confidence in both the safety of children in our public school systems and the laws designed to protect children at large.”

Tampa Bay Times,"Scientists call for a halt to genetically editing embryos, rebuke Chinese researcher","Leading genomic scientists urged national academies and scientific bodies Thursday against continuing with the clinical use of gene editing and sharply reprimanded a Chinese researcher who had violated international ethical standards in a secretive experiment that he says produced the world's first genetically edited babies.

The statement came at the conclusion of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, which became the focus of international attention this week following the stunning claim by Chinese scientist He Jiankui that he had created Lulu and Nana, twin girls whose genes had been edited to make them resistant to HIV.

""At this summit we heard an unexpected and deeply disturbing claim that human embryos had been edited and implanted, resulting in a pregnancy and the birth of twins,"" said the summit's organizing committee, which called for independent verification of He's claims that have so far not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

""Even if the modifications are verified, the procedure was irresponsible and failed to conform with international norms,"" the organizers said in the summit's highly anticipated consensus statement that is usually seen as setting the tone and direction for the fast-changing field.

The committee, representing leading researchers from the United States, Britain and Hong Kong, did not call for an outright ban on gene editing. Instead, it acknowledged that the field was moving toward a future where the procedures would be widely researched in clinical trials, and that researchers needed a rigorous framework to set ethical standards and guidelines. But in the meantime, the panel called for a halt.

""The organizing committee concludes that the scientific understanding and technical requirements for clinical practice remain too uncertain and the risks too great to permit clinical trials of germ line editing at this time,"" the closing statement said.

He's work was widely criticized this week by peer researchers and ethicists as a rogue demonstration of a gene editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9, which has opened up a world of new possibilities in biomedical research in recent years. Proponents foresee a time when lethal genetic diseases with no treatments could be eradicated, while critics fear that the technology might be used for casual genetic enhancements, to tweak traits like intelligence or height.

But until this week, such debates were largely theoretical, because no one was known to have established a pregnancy from a genetically-edited human embryo. He's claimed experiment was a rude awakening for scientists at the summit, and an urgent reminder that discussions about how to responsibly use a technology that could reshape the health and character of future generations might not be enough.

""The need for development of binding international consensus on setting limits for this kind of research . . . has never been more apparent. Without such limits, the world will face the serious risk of a deluge of similarly ill-considered and unethical projects,"" Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement. ""Should such epic scientific misadventures proceed, a technology with enormous promise for prevention and treatment of disease will be overshadowed by justifiable public outrage, fear, and disgust.""

Many countries outlaw such experiments, and in the United States, using genetically altered human embryos for reproductive purposes is effectively banned by law.

After word first leaked of He's project through news reports, scientists criticized the effort as irresponsible and premature. Investigations were opened into He's work by China's Southern University of Science and Technology, which has said the university was not informed of the experiment. He appeared before a packed audience in person and online to defend his work at the summit on Wednesday, but the presentation was far from convincing to experts.

Summit organizers concluded that He's work was deeply problematic. ""Its flaws include an inadequate medical indication, a poorly designed study protocol, a failure to meet ethical standards for protecting the welfare of research subjects, and a lack of transparency in the development, review and conduct of the clinical procedures,"" they said.

Outside scientists and ethicists slammed the experiment for being medically unnecessary, because the babies wouldn't have been born infected with the virus, which can also be prevented with existing, low-risk interventions. They questioned whether the effort had even succeeded at its own goal of making both girls immune to HIV after seeing He's data. And they warned the research had not ruled out potentially harmful unintended effects that could afflict the twins and now spread through the human lineage if they have children.

""Having listened to Dr. He, I can only conclude that this was misguided, premature, unnecessary and largely useless,"" said R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

For years, leading scientists have avoided advocating a ban on gene-editing technology for human reproduction, instead favoring a cautionary approach that such research should not proceed until certain conditions are met.

At the last meeting of the summit in 2015, scientists concluded by saying that it would be ""irresponsible"" to proceed until the safety concerns had been thoroughly vetted and a societal consensus had developed. But a report two years later by the National Academies of Sciences said that genome edits that could be inherited ""might be permitted"" if, for example, there were transparency and an unmet need, among other criteria. A report this summer by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the United Kingdom concluded that gene editing to influence future generations ""could be ethically acceptable in some circumstances.""

Those recommendations suggested the technology could be useful, which may have emboldened He. When he presented his research on Wednesday, he said he was ""proud"" of his work.

""My original thinking was based on the survey of the United States . . . or the British ethics statement or the Chinese study that gave us the signal that the majority of the public is supporting the use of human genome editing for treatment, including HIV prevention,"" He said.

Mathew Porteus, a pediatric stem cell scientist at Stanford University, said that in February, He told Porteus about his animal studies and an open trial in humans.

""I told him that it was irresponsible and reckless to proceed for many reasons and that he needed to discuss his plans with senior authorities in China before proceeding any further,"" Porteus said.

Several scientists said that a ban would be premature, but added that the technology was not ready to be used. Others said a clear message needed to be sent.

""My sense would be, given the circumstances, that anything short of a call for moratorium would be insufficient,"" said Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell biologist at the University of California at Davis. ""This has indicated that almost anyone could try this; this guy's not a physician, he's a physicist . . . There seems to be need for more clarity.""",29/11/2018

Tampa Bay Times,Organizations push to raise awareness at World Aids Day event,"TAMPA ­— A World AIDS Day awareness event in Tampa Saturday (Dec. 1) will feature health experts, onsite HIV screening and health and wellness vendors including Metro Wellness, Moffitt Cancer Center and Florida Family Health Center.

The family-friendly outdoor event will take place from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Positively U, Inc., 1420 W Waters Ave. The nonprofit outreach center for people with or affected by AIDS/HIV has teamed with The Tampa Alumnae and Tampa Metropolitan Alumnae chapters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority to bring awareness to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and the disease’s impact on the state of Florida.

Those who attend will be able to vote on their favorite entry in a student poster contest. The winners will receive a cash prize. The contest, event organizers said in a news release, is a way to engage a younger audience in this important health discussion.

“HIV/AIDS has become increasingly prevalent among the younger community, between the ages of 20 and 30,” Jacqueline Aiken-Jackson, who leads Tampa Alumnae chapter’s International Awareness and Involvement Committee. “We’re encouraging more young people to come and participate because they’re very much impacted by the prevalence of this disease and the rate in which it continues to spread.”

Delta Sigma Theta choose to collaborate with Positively U, Inc. because of its commitment to HIV/AIDS education and access to communities in need, according to the release. Many of the nonprofit’s staff and volunteers are HIV positive and can offer help to others who are making the same journey.

“The stigma regarding HIV is still prevalent throughout the United States,” Geneva Galloway, Positively U’s Director of Development, said in the statement. “If anything, it has increased. Yes, we have medications that are provided to clients, but we’re still in the preservation mode of not spreading the virus. The numbers are still rising. We’re just trying to encourage people to get tested and know their status.”",29/11/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Gene-editing Chinese scientist kept much of his work secret, reports second pregnancy","HONG KONG — A Chinese researcher who claims to have helped make the world's first genetically edited babies says a second pregnancy may be underway.

The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, revealed the possible pregnancy Wednesday while making his first public comments about his controversial work at an international conference in Hong Kong.

He claims to have altered the DNA of twin girls born earlier this month to try to make them resistant to infection with the AIDS virus. Mainstream scientists have condemned the experiment, and universities and government groups are investigating.

The second potential pregnancy is in a very early stage and needs more time to be monitored to see if it will last, He said.

Leading scientists said there are now even more reasons to worry, and more questions than answers, after He's talk. The leader of the conference called the experiment ""irresponsible"" and evidence that the scientific community had failed to regulate itself to prevent premature efforts to alter DNA.

Altering DNA before or at the time of conception is highly controversial because the changes can be inherited and might harm other genes. It's banned in some countries including the United States except for lab research.

He defended his choice of HIV, rather than a fatal inherited disease, as a test case for gene editing, and insisted the girls could benefit from it.

""They need this protection since a vaccine is not available,"" He said.

Scientists weren't buying it.

""This is a truly unacceptable development,"" said Jennifer Doudna, a University of California-Berkeley scientist and one of the inventors of the CRISPR gene-editing tool that He said he used. ""I'm grateful that he appeared today, but I don't think that we heard answers. We still need to understand the motivation for this.""

Doudna is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports AP's Health & Science Department.

""I feel more disturbed now,"" said David Liu of Harvard and MIT's Broad Institute, and inventor of a variation of the gene-editing tool. ""It's an appalling example of what not to do about a promising technology that has great potential to benefit society. I hope it never happens again.""

There is no independent confirmation of He's claim and he has not yet published in any scientific journal where it would be vetted by experts. At the conference, He failed or refused to answer many questions including who paid for his work, how he ensured that participants understood potential risks and benefits, and why he kept his work secret until after it was done.

After He spoke, David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate from the California Institute of Technology and a leader of the conference, said He's work ""would still be considered irresponsible"" because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered.

""I personally don't think that it was medically necessary. The choice of the diseases that we heard discussions about earlier today are much more pressing"" than trying to prevent HIV infection this way, Baltimore said.

The case shows ""there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community"" and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field, Baltimore said.

Before He's talk, Dr. George Daley, Harvard Medical School's dean and one of the conference organizers, warned against a backlash to gene editing because of He's experiment. Just because the first case may have been a misstep ""should in no way, I think, lead us to stick our heads in the sand and not consider the very, very positive aspects that could come forth by a more responsible pathway,"" Daley said.

""Scientists who go rogue ... it carries a deep, deep cost to the scientific community,"" Daley said.

Regulators have been swift to condemn the experiment as unethical and unscientific.

The National Health Commission has ordered local officials in Guangdong province to investigate He's actions, and his employer, Southern University of Science and Technology of China, is investigating as well.

On Tuesday, Qui Renzong of the Chinese Academy of Social Science criticized the decision to let He speak at the conference, saying the claim ""should not be on our agenda"" until it has been reviewed by independent experts. Whether He violated reproductive medicine laws in China has been unclear; Qui contends that it did, but said, ""the problem is, there's no penalty.""

He called on the United Nations to convene a meeting to discuss heritable gene editing to promote international agreement on when it might be OK.

Meanwhile, more American scientists said they had contact with He and were aware of or suspected what he was doing.

Dr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics researcher at Stanford University, where He did postdoctoral research, said He told him in February that he intended to try human gene editing. Porteus said he discouraged He and told him ""that it was irresponsible, that he could risk the entire field of gene editing by doing this in a cavalier fashion.""

Dr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford ethicist, said he has ""spent many hours"" talking with He over the last two years about situations where gene editing might be appropriate.

""I knew his early work. I knew where he was heading,"" Hurlbut said. When he saw He four or five weeks ago, He did not say he had tried or achieved pregnancy with edited embryos but ""I strongly suspected"" it, Hurlbut said.

""I disagree with the notion of stepping out of the general consensus of the scientific community,"" Hurlbut said. If the science is not considered ready or safe enough, ""it's going to create misunderstanding, discordance and distrust.""",28/11/2018

Tampa Bay Times,Chinese researcher claims he made the world's first genetically edited babies,"HONG KONG — A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world's first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.

If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.

A U.S. scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.

Many mainstream scientists think it's too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.

The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus.

He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.

There is no independent confirmation of He's claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.

""I feel a strong responsibility that it's not just to make a first, but also make it an example,"" He told the AP. ""Society will decide what to do next"" in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.

Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.

It's ""unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,"" said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.

""This is far too premature,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. ""We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal.""

However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University's George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called ""a major and growing public health threat.""

""I think this is justifiable,"" Church said of that goal.

In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that's causing problems.

It's only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it's not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.

He Jiankui (HEH JEE'-an-qway), who goes by ""JK,"" studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.

The U.S. scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called ""a small stake"" in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He's two companies.

The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.

He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.

All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.

Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.

He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym ""Bai Hua,"" told the AP that it's not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.

Here is how He described the work:

The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was ""washed"" to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.

When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.

Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.

Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.

They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.

""It's almost like not editing at all"" if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.

Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.

""In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you're exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,"" Musunuru said.

The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers' ""main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,"" Church said.

Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it's very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.

There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.

It's unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an ""AIDS vaccine development"" program.

The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he ""absolutely"" thinks they were able to understand the risks.

Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.

""That might be a layman's way of describing it,"" he said.

Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.

The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they're adults.

Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a ""first"" was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.

He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.

Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants' HIV infection from being disclosed.

""We think this is ethical,"" said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.

Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He's lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.

The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but ""are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it's their life on the line.""

""I believe this is going to help the families and their children,"" He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, ""I would feel the same pain as they do and it's going to be my own responsibility.""",26/11/2018

Tampa Bay Times,Why are we suddenly hearing about hepatitis A outbreaks? Experts blame the opioid crisis.,"In just the last two weeks, one restaurant in Tampa Bay has shut down and another closed temporarily after outbreaks of hepatitis A. Health officials in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties say reports of the virus are way up, and they worry that more are likely to come.

The cases are among a growing number of infections nationally, the largest outbreak since the hepatitis A vaccine was developed nearly 20 years ago.

So why is this happening now?

""The spread is intimately linked to the opioid crisis,"" said Jill Roberts, a professor of microbiology and environmental health at the University of South Florida. ""The biggest factors to this spread are IV drug use and homelessness. And now were seeing this spill over into restaurants.""

The owners of a Hamburger Marys franchise in Ybor City announced this week that the restaurant would not reopen after being closed temporarily when a worker there tested positive for hepatitis A. An announcement on its Facebook page lamented, ""The latest challenge over the last couple of weeks has proven too much to overcome.""

In response, the Hillsborough health department received 400 calls and administered 620 free hepatitis A vaccines to restaurant patrons.

RELATED: Hamburger Marys in Ybor City to close in wake of worker testing positive for hepatitis A

And on Monday, the Toasted Monkey Beach Bar & Grille on St. Pete Beach temporarily closed when one of its workers also tested positive for the virus.

""We alerted the public because of the number of patrons who could have been exposed to the virus while the person was on duty at the restaurant,"" said Maggie Hall, a spokeswoman with the Pinellas health department.

Hepatitis A is spread person-to-person through feces contaminated with the virus, so practicing proper hygiene is essential, health officials say. Symptoms include fever, dark urine, yellow-tinged skin or eyes, fatigue and gastric issues. It can cause damage to the liver, especially among those who already have liver disease.

At least 58 cases of the virus have been reported in Pinellas this year, including a jump of 10 cases from September to October. Last year, the county reported zero cases. In 2016, there were just two, and in 2015, just four.

Hillsborough County, meanwhile, has reported at least 36 cases of hepatitis A so far this year, compared to 10 all of last year and five in 2015 and 2016.

Generally, fewer than 3,000 cases of hepatitis A are reported nationwide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that hasnt been the case recently. More than 7,000 outbreak-associated cases have been reported from 12 states this year, said Dr. Monique Foster, an epidemiologist at the CDC.

""In the previous decade, most large outbreaks of hepatitis A were attributed to contaminated commercial food products. During 2017, however, most reports were primarily among people reporting drug use or experiencing homelessness,"" she said. ""Our most recent national data shows states experiencing outbreaks are facing unique challenges to reach people who are at greatest risk for infection.""

California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency last year over an outbreak of hepatitis A cases that began in San Diego and spread to the Los Angeles, Monterey and Santa Cruz areas. The state has been battling a rise for years, but in 2017 it reported more than 700 active cases with more than half of those patients needing to be hospitalized. All told, 21 people have died.

Getting the outbreak under control was a costly endeavor  California bleached the streets in San Diego, set up mobile vaccination units and hosted hundreds of vaccination events, opening dozens of public hand-washing stations.

Public health experts say the majority of the cases come from white men in their young adult years to middle age. Most are from transient populations with limited access to sanitation methods and are more commonly drug users.

""Were a little late to the game, in that we should have remembered the lessons we learned from other diseases, like the spread of HIV,"" said Roberts, the USF professor. ""The major factor is using dirty needles in unclean conditions. Restaurants are particularly susceptible to this population because they offer generally low-paying jobs, and there is a lot of turnover in employees. If someone who has active hepatitis A is handling food in a restaurant, all of those customers are at risk.""

There is no requirement for food handlers to be vaccinated against hepatitis A, said Dr. Kartik Cherabuddi, a physician with UF Health that specializes in infectious diseases.

""We predominantly dont see many outbreaks in restaurants because generally, food handlers are trained well in this country,"" he said.

But health inspections by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation show that the two local restaurants with positive cases had a recent history of sanitation issues. Reports from earlier this year show that food service workers at both Hambuger Marys and the Toasted Monkey lacked knowledge of food-borne illnesses and employees were handling food without washing their hands or wearing gloves.

The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association is keeping an eye on the situation and alerting its members to do the same, said spokeswoman Amanda Handley.

""The food code has very clear, effective policies regarding employee illness, and all who work in food service are required to have training to help keep everyone safe and healthy,"" she said. ""We have scheduled some social media posts to go out reminding members to ensure all employees are trained and directing them to our SafeStaff Food Handler training. Additionally, we have drafted messaging to include in our monthly newsletter.""

Consumers should also be aware of the outbreaks in their communities, as some may be at higher risk to contracting the virus than others, such as people who previously have been in jail or traveled internationally. All 1-year-old children, transient people, users of recreational drugs and gay men are encouraged to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

""The older you are, the higher the risk,"" Roberts said. ""In Florida, the vaccine has been on the schedule for 20 years. If you are older than that, theres a good chance you never got vaccinated.""

People who catch hepatitis A are the most infectious during the two weeks before they experience symptoms, Foster said.

""Many who are infected do not have symptoms that require medical care, some may unknowingly infect others before they know that they are infected,"" she said. ""This makes it difficult to find cases and provide timely vaccine to prevent people who were exposed to the virus from becoming infected.""

In addition to the vaccine, washing hands after a bathroom visit and after changing diapers lessens the chance that contamination will spread. But vaccination is the best protection against the virus.

Tampa Bay Times,"These are the stakes for LGBTQ Floridians in the 2018 election, advocates say","Florida is home to over 100,000 transgender adults, according to a 2016 study. Under new federal rules, any one of them working in a government office could be fired from their job for being transgender.

That's the worry of LGBTQ advocates — and the reality for many Floridians — in the wake of a series of proposed federal changes by the Trump administration. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote in an October 2017 memo that ""prohibition on sex discrimination…does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity"" under the Civil Rights Act. One year later, the Trump administration is considering ending the recognition of transgender people altogether in federal rules.

The new rules by the Trump administration could mean the dissolution of the last line of legal defense against workplace discrimination for Floridians who are a gender different than the one assigned to them at birth. But to many in the LGBTQ community, the problem goes beyond a lack of legal protections for trans Floridians. Advocates have argued for years that Florida lacks statewide anti-discrimination protections for all LGBTQ citizens. With no state or federal protections in place, LGBTQ Floridians are left to rely on local anti-discrimination ordinances to protect them from public discrimination.

""That Swiss cheese approach is not what we should be doing as a country,"" said Nathan Bruemmer, a local LGBTQ advocate who's organizing a ""Transgender Support Rally"" in St. Petersburg on Saturday.

The state's lack of anti-discrimination protections is one of the reasons why advocates — and recent history — say the 2018 elections could play a huge role in shaping the future of LGBTQ rights in Florida.

In particular, the next governor could do two major things to end anti-LGBTQ discrimination in the public arena, advocates say. He could sign the Competitive Workforce Act, a law, or sign an executive order with similar language banning discrimination in state offices and public housing.

""The support in Tallahassee for statewide nondiscrimination protections has been strong and bipartisan for years,"" said Nadine Smith, the co-founder and CEO of Equality Florida, one of the state's largest LGBTQ rights advocacy groups. ""The problem really has boiled down to leadership's unwillingness to let the bill move.""

When it comes to LGBTQ issues, Florida's Legislature does not seem to have the socially conservative bent of some Republican-led states. The Competitive Workforce Act was among the bills with the most cosponsors during last year's legislative session, with plenty of support coming from the Republican side of the aisle. And there is a lobbying group, Conservatives on the Right Side of Equality, that is dedicated to rallying Republican support for the CWA's passage.

Read more: This conservative group advocates for LGBTQ rights. Can it make itself heard in today's GOP?

Republicans who support the bill say workplace protections make the state more free and a more attractive place for large businesses to set up shop.

""From the Republican end, it's about freedom to be who you are and liberty,"" said Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, the CWA's Florida House sponsor. ""I mean those are two huge components of the platform.""

But many statewide advocates looking to find a champion of LGBTQ rights in the next governor say they're still hoping for Democrat Andrew Gillum to get elected this November.

""If we end up with (Republican) Ron DeSantis as the governor, I can only hope. But I can tell you, from the signals that he's sending now on the campaign trail, it doesn't seem like it's likely (he'll support the CWA),"" said Tony Lima, the executive director of SAVE, another influential LGBTQ rights group — of which Conservatives on the Right Side of Equality is a part. ""And that's why as an organization, we've endorsed Andrew Gillum.""

In October, the Times sent a list of questions to both gubernatorial campaigns asking the candidates how they would handle LGBTQ issues in Florida, including the Competitive Workforce Act. Gillum's campaign pointed to, among other things, the Tallahassee mayor's history of advocating for same-sex marriage rights. The campaign said Gillum would sign the CWA and the executive order banning workplace discrimination in state offices and public housing.

DeSantis' campaign sent back a one sentence statement: ""Ron DeSantis believes everyone should be treated equally. As Governor, he will not tolerate discrimination of any kind.""

Gov. Rick Scott, the current Republican governor, has long argued that current state anti-discrimination protections are adequate. When asked for comment, his office pointed to federal guidelines from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that say that discrimination in government offices against workers based on their sexuality or gender identity is illegal.

But the Trump administration is working to undermine some of those very rules, and they've never applied to private places of business. That's why advocates on both sides of the aisle say more robust anti-discrimination rules are needed. (The CWA proposed last Legislative session included a carve out for some small businesses and religious institutions.)

In particular, Raschein, the Republican state representative, said it's important not to leave transgender Floridians without legal protections.

""A lot of people want us to get rid of the T (in LGBTQ). And we can't get rid of the T, because once we exclude transgender people, we can't get it back,"" Raschein said.

Democratic Rep. Carlos G. Smith, Florida's first openly gay Latino state House representative, said ending public discrimination is just one issue of concern to LGBTQ Floridians. Banning conversion therapy, ending discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, fighting violence against transgender Floridians and erecting a memorial to the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting are also issues that are on the minds of many activists this election cycle.

""The gay agenda is what's on the table, which is go to work, go to the store, serve our country and not be discriminated against,"" Smith said.",04/11/2018

Tampa Bay Times,"Polk child sex sting arrests include two men who worked at Disney World, one HIV positive man","Frank Otero showed up with condoms and left in handcuffs.

The 29-year-old Holiday man was arrested as part of Operation Cyber Guardian, Fall Haul, a Polk County Sheriff’s Office sting targeting men detectives said were traveling to Polk County to have sex with 13- and 14-year-old children.

The Sheriff’s Office said Otero responded to a dating website ad posted by an undercover detective who was posing as a 14-year-old girl. He told the girl he was 19. Throughout an online conversation, Otero described the sexual activities he wanted to engage in and agreed to meet and travel for sex.

He was arrested at an undisclosed location in Polk County when he showed up to have sex with the person he thought was the 14-year-old.

The Sheriff’s Office Tuesday announced the arrests of 13 men as part of the operation for a running total of 58 charges — 57 of which are felonies. The sting took place between Oct. 2 and 7, the Sheriff’s Office said.

“We kept your children and our children safe from these folks who, in the last week, thought, ‘A-ha! I got me a child,” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Tuesday. “Well, a-ha, you got you a jail cell.”

During the six-day sting, detectives posed as girls and boys on online dating sites and social media sites to investigate potential predators. Of the 13 arrested, one man, Thien Nguyen, was found to have been dishonorably discharged from his post as a military police officer in the Air Force after he was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious molestation in 2014. The 26-year-old Orlando man served three years in military prison out of a five-year sentence and was on federal probation at the time. Detectives said he attempted to solicit a 13-year-old girl and sent photos of his genitals.

“He should’ve been locked up,” Judd said. “This is what makes me angry. He was caught. He had four victims before.”

Other suspects included Richard Hicks, a 29-year-old from Lake County who wanted to have unprotected sex with a 14-year-old boy, detectives said. They also said Hicks is documented as being HIV positive. In his correspondence with detectives, he asked if the boy would have To Catch a Predator waiting on him.

According to the Sheriff's Office, two men who worked at properties on Disney World were also arrested. Timo Townsend, 24, a food runner at the Boathouse Restaurant in Disney Springs, is accused of asking a 14-year-old girl to go “all the way” with him and Robert Grassano-Mazeika, 22, a cook at the Grand Floridian, wanted to have sex in a pool with who he thought was a 13-year-old girl. Detectives said he also sent photos of his genitals.

Many showed up with condoms. One even had an iPhone 8 Plus to give as a gift. All wound up in jail, Judd said.

“These are deviants, they’re not normal people,” Judd said. They look normal on the outside, but they are not normal people. They are child predators.”

Tampa Bay Times,Proposed Trump rules could make it harder for low-income women to get contraceptives,"When Nikia Jackson needed to be screened for a sexually transmitted disease, she wanted a clinic that was reputable, quick and inexpensive.

After searching online, Jackson, 23, ended up at the Obria Medical Clinics sparkling new facility in an office park in suburban Atlanta. She was unaware that the clinic does not offer condoms or other kinds of birth control beyond so-called natural family planning methods.

Religious conservatives say these types of clinics are the future of womens sexual health care in the United States.

""A woman needs choice, but you cant have a choice if the only clinic that a woman can go to is Planned Parenthood,"" said Kathleen Bravo, chief executive of the Obria Group and a devout Catholic.

Young women ""dont want to live every day having to take a carcinogen,"" she said, referring to hormonal contraception.

RELATED: New Florida law gives permanent state funding to private pregnancy centers

For decades, contraception drew widespread bipartisan support, but since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, religious conservatives trained their ire on the laws contraception mandates, and the politics of abortion and birth control converged.

Bravo is positioning her company to become a nationwide alternative to Planned Parenthood and aims for it to qualify for millions of dollars in federal family planning funds next year. With 38 clinics and 22 more slated to open, Obria offers tests for pregnancy, STIs, HIV and cervical cancer and prenatal care.

But patients seeking to prevent pregnancy can receive only fertility planning methods that require women to track their periods and refrain from sex when most fertile. When followed exactly, the method is 76 percent effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That vision has found favor with the Trump administration, which has proposed sweeping changes to a $280 million federal program called Title X, the only source of federal funds for birth control for low-income women who lack health insurance.

For more than four decades, thousands of womens health clinics, including Planned Parenthood affiliates, that received these federal funds have been required to offer a full range of medically effective contraception, including condoms, birth control pills, intrauterine devices and implants. (The clinics cannot use federal funds to pay for abortion, and many Title X clinics do not offer the procedure.)

But with Title X now under the direction of Dr. Diane Foley, the former chief executive of Life Network, a Christian organization that operates anti-abortion pregnancy centers, the Trump administration is widely expected to adopt rules in the coming months that promote and direct federal dollars to clinics like Obria that do not offer condoms, hormonal contraception, intrauterine devices or abortion.

Called the ""Protect Life Rule,"" the new restrictions are aimed at narrowing womens access to clinics that discuss or refer patients to abortion providers. The Trump administration has worked quickly to shape womens reproductive health care, rolling back an Obama-era rule that required employers to cover contraception in their health insurance plans and nominating to the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who referred to common forms of contraception as ""abortion-inducing drugs"" during his confirmation hearing.

With Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, as a powerful ally and anti-abortion and abstinence advocates, including Foley, appointed by the Trump administration overseeing key federal health programs, religious conservatives are seizing this moment to shape womens sexual health care.

In 2011, anti-abortion state lawmakers in Texas sought to shutter Planned Parenthood clinics and slashed state funding for family planning by 66 percent. As a result, more than 80 family planning clinics closed, and women across Texas suddenly found their birth control needs caught up amid the fight against abortion.

The impact was swift and widespread: Researchers found the number of women on the most effective forms of birth control  IUDs, implants and injections  plunged by a third, and births by poor women on Medicaid increased 27 percent from 2011 to 2014.

In the immediate aftermath, family planning clinics in Texas became almost entirely dependent on Title X federal funds. Now many administrators here and around the country are bracing for the Trump administrations new rules.

ALSO READ: Driven by demand, Planned Parenthood opens second clinic in Tampa

Kathryn Hearn, community services director at Access Esperanza in McAllen, Texas, said clinics that offer the full range of FDA-approved birth control could be replaced by those like Obria.

""Today a woman can come into a Title X clinic, any clinic in the United States, in Texas, and be offered a wide range of contraceptive methods,"" she said. ""With these proposed rules, she could only be offered abstinence. Well, she says, Im married. Or Im in a relationship. That does not work for me. I need real contraceptive care.""

Ofelia Alonso, a 22-year-old community organizer, said that because of deceptive tactics and lack of comprehensive sex education, young women in Texas already find it difficult to discern between medical clinics and crisis pregnancy centers, offices where women are counseled against abortion.

""Its like abstinence only, and then, crisis pregnancy centers, anti-abortion propaganda, defunding our family clinics. So what is left for us?"" Alonso said. ""Were going to have these weird centers where you cant get anything?""

But women seeking contraception have to go somewhere, and one alternative, she said, is to cross the nearby border into Mexico to buy birth control over the counter.

""It shouldnt have to be that way,"" she said. ""We shouldnt have to travel to another country to get what we need.""

Some uninsured patients in Texas do find alternative ways to get birth control.

Claire Hammons runs a historic hotel in Llano, a small city an hour and half west of Austin with no full-service womens health clinic.

The vast geography combined with widespread clinic closures means that some 10 million Texans live at least half an hour from a clinic, a common standard used to determine health care shortages. Its a phenomenon some call ""contraception deserts.""

Hammons lives in one of these contraception deserts and when she could no longer afford health insurance, she turned to the internet for help. Now, she gets her birth control delivered every three months to her mailbox from a San Francisco-based company called Nurx. She pays about $15 a month and can message Dr. Jessica Rubino, a Nurx physician in Austin. Rubino can review her patients medical histories and renew their prescriptions without additional cost.

Rubino said she sees what happens to women who live in contraception deserts.

""Im also an abortion provider, and I do that outside of Nurx at another facility,"" she said. ""I had one (patient) last week who drove five hours to see me. And the entire reason that she came to see me for the abortion is because she didnt have any access to contraception.""

That lack of access worries Kami Geoffray, CEO of the Womens Health and Family Planning Association of Texas, the nonprofit group that has coordinated the states application for Title X funds.

If the Trump administrations overhaul of Title X succeeds, Geoffray said, it will undermine the goal of the program that the federal government has operated since the 1970s.

""We know that every dollar we spend on Title X saves $7 across other government programs, including Medicaid,"" said Geoffray. ""We avert Medicaid births very frequently by (getting contraception for) clients and preventing unplanned pregnancies.""

But back in suburban Atlanta at the Obria Medical Clinic, Bravo has declared its time for companies like hers to put a bigger mark on reproductive health care. The company is launching a $240 million capital campaign to open more clinics.

""Obria is a comprehensive primary care clinic for women that is an alternative model to Planned Parenthood,"" said Bravo. ""We put huge amounts of money into marketing our clinics, like all medical clinics do, to make sure that women know that were here in their city.""

Tampa Bay Times,Rick Scott accused of flouting public records law; governor blasts law firm’s ‘dirty tactics’,"TALLAHASSEE — A state judge is being asked to levy fines of $1,000 a day on Gov. Rick Scott for not complying with a court order to turn over copies of his calendar and future travel plans.

The law office of Steven Andrews filed an emergency motion for contempt and sanctions Tuesday in circuit court in Tallahassee, after expiration of a 10-day period in which Scott was ordered by Circuit Judge Charles Dodson to provide the records, including for Scott's U.S. Senate campaign, for a three-month period ending Oct. 31.

""Every public official must comply with Florida's public records laws or lawful and valid court orders — even Gov. Rick Scott,"" Andrews' firm argues. ""Holding (the governor's office) in civil contempt provides the necessary and appropriate relief for (its) contemptuous conduct, which is contrary to the mandate and purpose of the Florida Constitution.""

Scott has filed a notice of appeal with the First District Court of Appeal. The governor's office said the filing of an appeal automatically stays Dodson's ruling, but Andrews says the stay is good for only 48 hours.

UPDATE: The governor's office got a stay from the appeals court Tuesday, so the plaintiff's motions are moot.

Andrews' firm represents the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a South Florida non-profit that had a contract to treat HIV/AIDS patients.

In a statement Tuesday, Scott's office accused the vendor of retaliating as a result of being denied a state contract after a competitive bid process.

""We will continue to fight to protect Florida taxpayers from these dirty tactics,"" Scott's office said, and claimed that the vendor offered to drop two public records lawsuits if it got a contract extension.

Attorney Ryan Andrews called the ""dirty tactics"" charge ""unfortunate,"" and said: ""(Scott's office) willfully chose to ignore a court order and now it must answer for that decision.""

Scott's attorney, Barry Richard of Greenberg Traurig, argued in circuit court that the requested information is confidential, pursuant to an exemption in Florida's public records law for information that would reveal ""surveillance techniques, procedures or personnel.""

Judge Dodson rejected that argument, despite the sworn declaration from FDLE Assistant Special Agent in Charge Darrick Waller, who told the court: ""Premature disclosure of prospective information regarding the governor's detailed schedule, including drive times, and the time and location of the governor's arrival and departure, would reveal FDLE's surveillance techniques, procedures and personnel and would compromise the safety and security of the governor.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Locked in legal battle, Rick Scott’s office and health vendor trade charges","Gov. Rick Scott's office and a health care provider are locked in a dispute over public records and whether the vendor would end its legal battles against Scott's office if the state would extend its contract.

Scott's office says yes. The vendor's lawyer says no. The relevant email traffic is below.

AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), a South Florida nonprofit, had a six-year, competitively bid contract to treat AIDS and HIV patients. The state did not renew AHF's contract and the company has filed a formal protest, which is pending before an administrative law judge in Tallahassee.

AHF is represented by Tallahassee lawyer Ryan Andrews, who recently won a lawsuit after demanding three months' worth of Scott's schedule records, including all upcoming U.S. Senate campaign appearances through Oct. 31. Circuit Judge Charles Dodson ordered the documents to be made public by Monday.

Scott's office, which has clashed in the past with Andrews' law firm, claims the vendor proposed ending its litigation in return for state business.

""The email speaks for itself. They offered to drop the public records lawsuit and withdraw the requests IF they received a contract from AHCA (the state Medicaid agency, the Agency for Healthcare Administration),"" said Mara Gambineri, a spokesman for Scott.

Not true, Andrews says. His client ""made a proposal to settle all litigation between itself and the state … It's sad but not surprising that the Executive Office of the Governor chose to mischaracterize these routine settlement discussions to try to save face after Judge Dodson rebuked (Scott's office) in a written order involving its failure to provide public records.""

Below is an email Andrews sent on Aug. 22 to Scott's lawyer, Barry Richard of Greenberg Traurig in Tallahassee, which includes the AIDS Healthcare Foundation's one-year contract proposal to resolve the litigation. (The acronym PRR refers to public records request).

The yellow highlights were provided by the governor’s office. EOG is shorthand for Executive Office of the Governor.

Andrews said the decision by Scott's office to release the above email, marked as privileged attorney-client information, was not consistent with the Florida evidence code.

Tampa Bay Times,Lawsuit says Rick Scott’s office won’t fulfill public records request,"A lawyer who recently won a public records lawsuit against Gov. Rick Scott sued his office again Thursday, accusing his administration of ignoring a separate request for public records needed in a pending legal case.

""You must acknowledge the request and respond to the request in good faith,"" Ryan Andrews said in a letter to Scott's office included in a complained filed in circuit court. ""Time is of the essence.""

Scott's office said it did acknowledge the request.

""This lawsuit is nothing more than a publicity stunt and a desperate attempt on behalf of a vendor who is upset that the state will be contracting with another service provider to offer HIV/AIDS services statewide following a transparent, competitive bid process,"" Scott's office said.

Andrews represents the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which recently lost a bid to renew a state health care contract. AHF protested the contract award, its case is pending before the an administrative panel, and the case is set to conclude in less than three weeks.

As part of its case, AHF wants records of communications between Scott's office and dozens of health care lobbyists who represented rival vendors. The list of lobbyists includes Dean Cannon, Al Cardenas, Mike Corcoran, Hayden Dempsey, Nick Iarossi, Fred Karlinsky, Larry Overton, Bill Rubin and Gerald Wester, among many others.

On July 31, Andrews asked for the records. On Sept. 7, he demanded them in five days. In court papers, he says Scott's office has not responded. He filed suit Thursday and is seeking an accelerated court hearing and wants the governor's office to pay his legal fees.

In a separate case, when Scott's office refused to give Andrews copies of his official schedules for a three-month period ending Oct. 31, 2018, Andrews sued the governor and won. Circuit Judge Charles Dodson ordered Scott to produce the records within a 10-day period ending Saturday, Sept. 15.

""(Scott's office) sure wasn't thinking of the taxpayers when they refused to produce the governor's calendars, hired private counsel and were determined to be wrong in court,"" Andrews said.

As athletes such as Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James strive to use their athletic stardom as a platform for social justice, they might want to look back at what this soft-spoken African-American tennis star accomplished during the age of Jim Crow and apartheid.

The first thing they will discover is that, like most politically motivated athletes, Ashe turned to activism only after his formative years as an emerging sports celebrity. He began his career as the Jackie Robinson of mens tennis  a vulnerable and insecure racial pioneer instructed by his coaches to hold his tongue as long as the success of desegregation was still in doubt.

The calculus of risk and responsibility changed in 1968, as 25-year-old Ashe reinvented himself as an activist. With his stunning victory in the U.S. Open, where he overcame the best pros in the world as a fifth-seeded amateur, he gained a new confidence that affected all aspects of his life.

Ashes new attitude reflected a determination to make amends for his earlier inaction. ""There were times, in fact,"" he recalled years later, ""when I felt a burning sense of shame that I was not with other blacks  and whites  standing up to the fire hoses and the police dogs, the truncheons, bullets and bombs."" He added: ""As my fame increased, so did my anguish.""

The 1968 assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy shook Ashes faith in America. But he refused to surrender to disillusionment. Instead he dedicated himself to active citizenship on a level rarely seen in the world of sports.

His activism began with an effort to expand economic and educational opportunities for young inner-city blacks, but later turned to the liberation of black South Africans suffering under apartheid, promoting higher educational standards for college athletes, criminal justice reform, gender equity and AIDS awareness.

By the end of his life, Ashes success on the court was no longer the primary source of his celebrity. He had become, along with Muhammad Ali, a prime example of an athlete who transcended the world of sports. In 2016, President Barack Obama identified Ali and Ashe as the sports figures he admired above all others  ""transformational"" activists who pushed the nation toward freedom and democracy.

Ashe practiced his own distinctive brand of activism, one based on unemotional appeals to common sense and ethical principles as simple as the Golden Rule. A champion of civility, he always kept his cool and never raised his voice in anger or frustration. Viewing emotional appeals as self-defeating and even dangerous, he relied instead on reasoned persuasion.

Ashe preferred to make his case either as a writer or as a speaker on the college lecture circuit. His periodic pieces in the Washington Post and other newspapers tackled thorny social issues, and in the 1980s he devoted several years to researching and writing A Hard Road to Glory, a groundbreaking three-volume history of African-American athletes.

Suspicious of quick fixes, he advocated incremental change. Yet he did not let this commitment to long-term solutions interfere with his determination to give voice to the voiceless. Known as a risk taker as a player, he was no less bold off the court. He was arrested twice, once in 1985 during an anti-apartheid demonstration, and again in 1992 while protesting against the Bush administrations discriminatory policies toward Haitian refugees. The first arrest embarrassed the American tennis establishment, which soon removed him from his position as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team, and the second took place during the final months of his life as he struggled with AIDS.

Ashe was a class act in every way, a man unfazed by the temptations of power, fame or fortune. When we place his approach to dissent in a contemporary frame, his legacy looms as the antithesis of the bullying tactics and insulting rhetoric of a president determined to punish athletes who have the audacity to speak out against police brutality toward African-Americans.

Not all of the activist athletes involved in public protests during the past two years have followed Ashes model of restraint and civility. But many have made a good-faith effort to do so, resisting the temptation to respond in kind to attacks on their personal integrity and patriotism. The most visible activists  Colin Kaepernick, Stephen Curry and LeBron James  have kept their composure and dignity even as they have borne the brunt of Donald Trumps racially charged Twitter storms and speeches.

They have taken the same high road that Ashe took two generations ago, and were he alive today he would be gratified that this high road has led to more protest, not less, confirming his belief that real change comes from rational advocacy and hard work, not emotional self-indulgence. As we celebrate his remarkable life and legacy a quarter century after his death, we can be confident that he would join todays activists in spirit and solidarity, solemnly but firmly taking a knee for social justice.

Tampa Bay Times,We’re not criminals anymore’: Indians revel in the repeal of a 157-year-old law banning gay sex,"NEW DELHI  She read in the morning paper that the decision was coming, so the 24-year-old masters student skipped classes Thursday and came to the Supreme Court building flanked by two friends. As they heard the courts landmark ruling that overturned Indias colonial-era ban on same-sex intercourse, the young women hugged and one cried.

""Were not criminals anymore,"" she said.

But as dozens of activists celebrated on the lawns outside the court, the young woman wearing a short haircut and gold-rimmed spectacles remained in a corner with her friends, shooing news photographers away. She lives at home and is not ready to come out to her parents.

Hers was a private celebration, yet one joined by millions of Indians both closeted and outspoken who cheered a historic victory for civil rights in the worlds largest democracy.

A five-judge panel voted unanimously to overturn Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, ending a two-decade legal battle against one of the most hidebound relics of Indias colonial past. The law criminalized intercourse ""against the order of nature,"" which was taken to mean same-sex relations even between consenting adults, and imposed a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.

Prosecutions under the law were rare, but many gay and transgender Indians said the law was sometimes used as a tool of intimidation and extortion.

In a 500-page ruling that invoked ideals of equality, morality, individual choice and even the very nature of love, the judges delivered a thundering denunciation of the 157-year-old statute introduced by British rulers at the peak of priggish Victorian-era values  and upheld by the same Indian Supreme Court just five years ago.

""Section 377 is irrational, arbitrary and incomprehensible,"" Chief Justice Dipak Misra said, adding that Indias LGBTQ community possesses the ""same equality as other citizens.""

Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud wrote: ""What makes life meaningful is love. The right that makes us human is the right to love. To criminalize the expression of that right is profoundly cruel and inhumane.""

The ruling signaled how far India has come in a short time to become more accepting of its gay and transgender citizens but only decriminalized sexual acts. India still does not permit same-sex couples to marry, adopt or inherit property.

""This fight doesnt end here,"" said Keshav Suri, a 33-year-old hotelier who was one of several citizens who filed suit challenging the law. Suri burst out of the courthouse after the verdict was read and exclaimed to his French husband, whom he wed in Paris last year: ""Marry me again!""

Even with other fights ahead, he said, this was a victory to relish.

""Im illegal no more,"" he said. ""Im in the shadows no more. Im in the darkness no more.""

The sweeping verdict appeared to surprise even the laws most ardent opponents, some of whom had wondered whether the judges would strike it down on narrow privacy grounds without affirming the broader rights of LGBTQ Indians.

""This is not a narrow, do-what-you-want-in-your-bedroom type of decision,"" said Menaka Guruswamy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ""This is so much wider than that, and the fact that many of the justices linked this to the idea of freedom and consent, that it was unanimous, that all of them looked to India as a constitutional democracy its huge.""

Britain decriminalized homosexuality in 1967  poet Oscar Wilde and mathematician Alan Turing were among those prosecuted under anti-gay laws  but similar statutes remain in place in dozens of former British colonies, such as Malaysia and Singapore.

Activists hoped Indias ruling could spur changes elsewhere. The South Asia director for Human Rights Watch, Meenakshi Ganguly, called it ""a momentous step that will resonate around the world.""

Activists had battled to overturn Section 377 in the courts since the 1990s, when the Naz Foundation, an organization working with HIV patients and to promote sexual health, filed one of the first legal challenges calling for homosexuality to be decriminalized.

In 2009, a court in Delhi overturned the law, ruling that it violated freedoms enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

But after appeals by religious and other groups, the Supreme Court reinstated Section 377 in a controversial 2013 decision, arguing that the legislature should decide the laws fate.

In February 2016, the high court said it would reexamine that ruling, reflecting growing acceptance of LGBTQ Indians.

Top officials from the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party government also signaled support for decriminalizing homosexuality, which some said had marred Indias standing in the international community.

This year, the Indian government said it would leave the matter to the Supreme Court. But in a nod to its hard-line Hindu supporters  some of whom regard homosexuality as unnatural  the government said it reserved the right to comment on issues that could come before the court later, including gay marriage and adoption by same-sex couples.

Guruswamy, the lawyer, said the wide-ranging nature of the verdict raised hopes that it could be used to further expand LGBTQ rights.

""The fact that is located so heavily in the larger question of non-discrimination makes me very optimistic about the future,"" she said.

Anand Grover, a lawyer representing the Naz Foundation, said the ruling showed that ""the future is for everybody.""

""The majoritarian thinking cannot decide morality,"" Grover said. ""Their right to equality, non-discrimination, privacy, dignity is as available as to everybody else. We have to build an inclusive society.""

Yashwinder Singh, a 38-year-old LGBT activist and one of the petitioners in the case, jostled his way out of the courtroom even before the justices had finished reading excerpts of their statements, to share the news with those who could not get in to witness history.

In the narrow corridor outside, Singh was greeted with relieved hugs. A young man held up a poster that read: ""Love is Gender Less.""

Pulling a rainbow-colored scarf from his bag, Singh said: ""This is a huge relief but our work will actually start now. It will help us counter the stigma associated with homosexuality in society now that the law supports us. Its the first step.""",06/09/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Judge orders Rick Scott to release travel, campaign records; Governor will appeal","A judge on Wednesday ordered Gov. Rick Scott to release about three months' worth of meeting schedules and travel plans — including upcoming campaign events — and rejected his argument that the information should remain secret for security reasons.

Circuit Judge Charles Dodson in Tallahassee ruled in favor of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The group sued the governor in July demanding a complete copy of Scott's calendars for the period beginning July 20, 2018 and ending on Oct. 31, 2018.

Read the judge's order here.

The period covered by the request includes most of the time leading up to election day, Nov. 6, where Scott is the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.

READ MORE: Health care group files lawsuit to get Rick Scott's schedule

Scott's office called the judge's decision ""irresponsible"" and said he will appeal Dodson's ruling to the 1st District Court of Appeal.

""FDLE, who oversees the governor's security, has submitted an affidavit to the court stating that releasing details of the governor's schedule weeks in advance would pose a security risk and is protected from release under Florida law,"" Scott spokesman John Tupps said. ""This ruling is irresponsible and puts the safety of the governor at risk.""

Tupps said the lawsuit was brought by a disgruntled vendor.

""That is absolutely not true,"" said Jeff Blend, the foundation's assistant general counsel. ""This is about public access to what are clearly public records.""

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation is a South Florida not-for-profit that serves thousands of HIV/AIDS patients in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. It recently lost a bid to renew a state Medicaid contract.

Scott claimed that the requested information that has not already been made public is protected by a public records exemption that covers surveillance techniques, procedures and personnel.

But Dodson, in a court order issued Wednesday, said that exemption in state law is under a sub-category called ""agency investigations,"" and that AHF's request ""does not concern an agency investigation.""

""Requesting his travel information is not exempt under the cited exemption,"" the judge wrote.

Dodson gave Scott's office 10 days, or until Sept. 15, to provide the requested information, which also includes campaign and fund-raising events Scott plans to participate in between July 20 and Oct. 31 .

Throughout his nearly eight years in office, Scott has routinely redacted or removed information from his schedule, even long after events have taken place, citing the same surveillance exemption.

Tampa Bay Times,Ray Arsenault’s Arthur Ashe: A Life’ is the definitive account of the activist and athlete,"Timing is everything in tennis.

Timing can be everything in a life as well. In 1947, Arthur Ashe Sr. took a job as caretaker of Brook Field Park, the largest park for black people in Richmond, Va. It was one of the few places in that deeply segregated city where a black child like Ashes skinny 4-year-old son, Arthur Jr., would have been allowed anywhere near a tennis court. The Ashes lived in the park, just a few steps from the courts where Arthur Jr. would take the swings that launched one of the most storied careers in the sport.

Timing is a factor, too, in the launch this week of Arthur Ashe: A Life, the first definitive biography of the athlete, author, and civil rights and AIDS activist.

The new books author, historian and St. Petersburg resident Raymond Arsenault, says, ""Its the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Open, and Arthur, of course, won the first one. He would have turned 75 in July, and its 25 years since his death.

""The largest tennis venue in the world is named after him,"" Arsenault says. ""He hasnt been forgotten, but I want to introduce him to a new generation and put him in context.""

That he does. The biography covers Ashes tennis career in meticulous detail, from his play in blacks-only tournaments around the South as a teenager through his breakout years at the University of California, Los Angeles and on to his victories around the globe as a cool and disciplined professional, and his role in the changing nature of tennis as a sport and business in the 1980s and 90s.

But thats only part of what makes him significant, Arsenault says. ""Ashe is a major figure of the 20th century. Hes an athletic figure like no other, but he was also a public intellectual."" Ashe was an author, an activist for civil rights and against South African apartheid, a crusader for education, a broadcaster, a businessman and, in the last years of his brief life  he died at age 49 after contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion after open-heart surgery  an advocate for HIV/AIDS awareness in a time when the disease was regarded as an unmentionable stigma.

Arsenaults book gracefully weaves together all those complex strands, along with Ashes complicated personal life as a black man who spent much of his life breaking barriers in a very white tennis world. Despite many deep and enduring friendships, Arsenault says, Ashe often ""was so alone. People say he was the Jackie Robinson of tennis, and he was. But there was no Willie Mays, no Hank Aaron. Just him.""

Chatting in his book- and memorabilia-stuffed office on the campus of the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, Arsenault says that placing Ashe within all that rich context was a daunting task. ""This was a 9-year project. If I had known, I might not have started. I actually walked away from it for a year"" after his parents died. ""This story is so sad, and I know how its going to end. I knew he and Jeanne would adopt this precious little girl, and shed be 6 years old and then hed die.""

But he walked back. The result is a 767-page book based on more than 150 interviews, an ""enormous paper trail"" (including Ashes own four books and archives at the Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture, UCLA and elsewhere) and extensive access to Ashes widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, and other family and friends.

Intensive research has been part of Arsenaults life work. He is the John Hope Franklin professor of Southern history at USFSP, where he has been on the faculty for 39 years and is the co-founder of the Florida studies program. He earned his bachelors degree at Princeton and his masters and doctorate at Brandeis University.

At 70, Arsenault is a nationally renowned civil rights historian whose earlier books include Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice and The Sound of Freedom: Marian Anderson, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Concert That Awakened America. Freedom Riders was the basis for a 2010 PBS American Experience documentary of the same title, which won three Emmys and a George Peabody Award.

Arsenault lives in St. Petersburg with his wife, Kathy, who retired as the dean of USFSPs library. They have two daughters, Amelia, a college professor, and Anne, a lawyer; and a grandson, Lincoln.

The inspiration for the Ashe biography, Arsenault says, goes back a long way. ""The book is dedicated to one of my two best friends in college, Jim Horton. Back then he was a dead ringer for Ashe. They were born the same year, and Jim looked just like him.

""He was my tennis partner  thats how I got initiated into the cult of Ashe. All the graduate students (at Brandeis) played tennis. We would have finished our dissertations five years earlier if we hadnt played so much tennis.""

Hortons resemblance to Ashe was so strong that at one tournament they attended he signed autographs for fans who thought he was the famous player.

""They walked away and looked at the autographs and said, That doesnt say Arthur Ashe! "" Arsenault recalls. Horton, who became a professor of history and American studies at George Washington University, died in 2017.

Arsenaults admiration for one of the superstars of tennis shows in the books in-depth depiction of Ashes style of play. ""Hes this angelic assassin. There was that joy for the game he never lost. He weighed 155 pounds and had the hardest serve in tennis. How does that happen?""

Among many other accomplishments documented in the book, Ashe was the Wimbledon champion in 1975, and, after heart surgery took him out of professional competition, he was named captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team in 1981 and led them to two victories.

Another thread that led Arsenault to Ashe was that ""I was interested in sports history. Its the kind of thing you can teach after you get tenure.""

Attitudes toward Ashe were an example of ""what we call romantic racialism,"" the notion that some black athletes and entertainers are especially gifted  and should use that gift to entertain whites. ""Not only are they supposed to suffer oppression, but theyre not supposed to make whites feel guilty about it.""

Arsenaults deep interest in civil rights history was, of course, another link. In the biography, he juxtaposes Ashes career and personal life with historic events. In 1963, the year Ashe became the first black player chosen for the U.S. Davis Cup team, Alabama governor George Wallace pledged to defend ""segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever."" Ashes landmark victory in Davis Cup play a few months later happened on the same day Ku Klux Klan members bombed a church in Birmingham, Ala., killing four black girls.

Early in his career, Ashe avoided political comment  ""His father told him, stay away from that mess,"" Arsenault says. But 1968 was not only the year Ashe won the U.S. Open; it was also the year he became an activist.

""The assassinations were what pushed him into activism,"" Arsenault says of the deaths that year of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy. Ashe had corresponded with King and met Kennedy, and he admired both men and was nurturing budding relationships with both of them.

Arsenault recounts in the book Ashes long crusade against the system of apartheid in South Africa, which led to his friendship with the nations eventual leader Nelson Mandela.

""He became very close to Mandela. When Mandela came to the United State, they asked him, who do you want to meet? He said, Arthur Ashe.

""Mandela embraced him, and Ashe went to South Africa and spent time with him. Like Mandela, Ashe was all about reconciliation, not holding grudges.""

Ashes activism, Arsenault says, was always measured rather than fiery. ""He always understood that his way was not the only way. He was willing to change his mind. Like about South Africa  for so long, he was for engagement. But then he realized that isolation (such as boycotts) would be more effective in making the change.""

Ashes involvement in such causes often inspired others. When Ashe wanted to play tennis in South Africa to challenge apartheid, Arsenault says, ""Cliff Drysdale, the white South African player, who was opposed to apartheid, told Arthur, They wont have you. It took him four years to get a visa, but they finally let him in.""

For the book, Arsenault interviewed Drysdale, who became a tennis commentator for ESPN, about a video he was asked to do about Ashe. ""He said, I had to turn them down because I cant keep my composure. He changed my life. He was sitting in the Waldorf Astoria telling me this and crying."" Telling the story, Arsenault tears up himself.

""Even during the horrific years with AIDS, he had such serenity,"" Arsenault says. ""He wrote that he never lost a nights sleep over it. Can you imagine?

""Even during that part of his life, he was so generous, so selfless. So much of Arthurs influence came after his death. The courageous way he faced AIDS and death kicked it up to a whole other level.""

This week, Arsenault will be at the U.S. Open in Flushing, N.Y. Its just part of the promotion for the book. ""I thought I was done,"" he says, but hes been giving interviews and writing essays almost nonstop.

At the Open, hell see many of the people he interviewed for the book. He was able to speak to almost everyone he wanted to, he says, except Billie Jean King, who won the womens singles at the Open the same year Ashe won the mens  two trailblazers on the courts.

Ashe died in 1993, long before Arsenault began work on the biography. ""I never met him. I saw him play twice. Maybe it helped me to have a little bit of detachment.

""But you cant pretend you feel the same about Bull Connor as you do about John Lewis. A figure like Ashe soars above the rest of us.""

What, hes asked, if Ashe had lived?

""Hed be the same age as Joe Biden. Hed be in the thick of it.

""And he would take a knee,"" Arsenault says with conviction.

""Arthur was the antithesis of Trumpism. He hated bullies. I think Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are kind of Ashe-like, in a sense. Theyve been very respectful, not emotional.

""Hed be with them in solidarity and spirit.""

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Hillsborough has a place among growing number of governments suing opioid makers,"Local governments across the land can find plenty of reasons to go after the drug industry over the crisis of opioid addiction.

Hillsborough County can find more reasons than most.

 In 2016, the county led the state with 579 babies born addicted to drugs.

 Through a unique, tax-supported health plan, Hillsborough provides health coverage to poor people who dont qualify for it through plans such as Medicare and Medicaid. The plan is incurring inordinately high costs for treating people with opioid addictions.

 The U.S. Department of Justice has recognized the Middle District of Florida centered in Hillsborough as an opioid ""hot spot"" and assigned one of 12 prosecutors here to focus on opiate-related health care fraud.

 Contributing to this special federal status: One of the nations most notorious pill mills, First Medical Group, operated on North Dale Mabry Highway through 2010. Pills were resold nationwide at up to $80 apiece. By some analyses, 30 people died from overdoses or other causes traced to the clinic.

RELATED:Hillsborough officials announce details of opiod suit

So local leaders are to be commended for taking a leadership role in filing a lawsuit Monday against a long list of drug makers and distributors, from Purdue Pharma to CVS and Walgreens, saying the companies embarked on a well-funded marketing scheme rooted in false and deceptive statements about the risks and benefits of long-term opioid use.

The lawsuit contains the disturbing boilerplate language found in a growing number of legal actions filed by the local governments who are bearing the brunt of the opioid crisis. But the lawsuit also notes the elevated stake Hillsborough has in holding accountable those who caused the crisis.

On Monday, local leaders announced the lawsuit as they stood with attorney Mike Moore, former Mississippi attorney general and a main figure in the wave of ongoing opioid lawsuits and before them, the lawsuits that brought the tobacco industry to account.

The announcements came in a week when the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new report on another annual rise in deaths from opioids and when President Donald Trump  criticized for declaring a national crisis without providing resources to tackle it  urged the Justice Department to sue manufacturers.

What remains to be seen is how the courts will deal with a potential federal suit, on top of some 1,000 separate lawsuits by local governments and more by nearly every state attorney general. Also in question is whether a solution lies in legal action or in the work now under way by legislative bodies at the state and national level. Florida this year implemented strict new limits on the length of opioid prescriptions.

For now, the best answer may be: Try anything.

Drug overdoses killed about 72,000 Americans last year, the CDC reported  a record number that reflects a rise of about 10 percent and a higher yearly death total, the New York Times notes, than peak yearly totals from HIV, car crashes or gun deaths. The agency also reported this month that the number of children born in hospitals addicted to opioids grew fourfold from 1999 to 2014.

The role of the drug industry is difficult to deny. Addiction has tracked closely with a rise in the rate of prescriptions, the CDC notes, and the rate of prescriptions tracks closely with the marketing push by the industry.

Its hard to remember, as the Hillsborough lawsuit notes, that before the 1990s opioids were prescribed only for the most severe short-term pain  after surgery, for example, or during end-of-life care. From the beginning, there has been little evidence that opioids helped patients overcome pain and still function and plenty of evidence that pain returned as patients develop a tolerance over time.

Between then and now, the lawsuit says, drug makers and distributors used all manner of techniques to push sales while downplaying and even ignoring the risks  then showing reluctance to help deal with the problem of addiction even as the crisis unfolded.

Holding them accountable for past misdeeds may not in itself solve the opioid crisis. But a similar approach through the courts targeting the tobacco industry, and the money for anti-smoking initiatives it generated, has certainly helped cut the nations addiction to cigarettes.

For Hillsborough, which plans to release an action plan soon for dealing with the opioid crisis, the lawsuit holds promise as a way to help pay for it some day.",17/08/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Health care company sues to get Rick Scott’s schedule,"A not-for-profit health care company that lost a bid to renew its Medicaid contract with the state had a question for Gov. Rick Scott: Where can we find you?

They asked his staff to send them a copy of his schedule — in the office and on the campaign trail — for the next three months so they could talk to him about their concerns.

They argued that documents, compiled and recorded by taxpayer-paid staff and followed by the state's top executive, his security entourage and other people on the state payroll, are public record and ought to be available for anyone in the state to see.

But the governor's office wouldn't turn them over, claiming the calendars — even those already sent to the public — are exempt from public disclosure.

On Thursday, Aids Healthcare Foundation filed a lawsuit against Scott, accusing the Republican governor of violating the Florida public records law. They are asking the Leon County Circuit Court to order him to produce the records or, at least, review the records behind closed doors to determine whether the governor is right to keep them exempt.

""We have a right to know: Is he meeting with pharmaceutical companies, with for-profit insurance companies? Is he out playing golf, or is he representing the people?'' asked Imara Canady, spokesman for the Aids Healthcare Foundation which operates the Florida health care provider that lost the bid to renew its contract. ""From where we stand, this is not an unfair request.""

Scott, the two-term governor who is now running for U.S. Senate, routinely offers fewer details on his public schedules than the three governors who preceded him. There are vast stretches of time in his daily public calendar that are not documented. He frequently lists ""work and call time"" on his public calendar, but he rarely provides details about who he is working with or calling.

Public record requests for copies of his more detailed calendars, sought after the fact, are heavily redacted and often take months to obtain.

AHF is a not-for-profit health plan that serves thousands of HIV/AIDS patients in Miami-Dade and Broward counties through the state's Medicaid managed care plan.

Its contract, which began in 2013, expires at the end of 2018 and was valued at over $800 million over five years. In April, AHF lost its bid to renew it when the state awarded the contract in Miami-Dade and Broward to a for-profit arm of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield corporation.

AHF, which operates under the name PHC Florida HIV/AIDS Specialty Plan, filed a bid protest and has a hearing scheduled for Aug. 7 before the Department of Administrative Hearings.

The company argues that by not selecting them as an option for patients, the state ""threatens to disrupt the care of thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS at a time when Florida continues to pull back on other resources devoted to combating this problem.""

""We're not saying they shouldn't contract with the other plan, but they shouldn't cut us out of the process,'' said Jeffrey Bland, AHF's assistant general counsel. ""We are a long-standing provider with particular experience in providing this kind of care to people with HIV, and it's a terrible disruption for our members to have their plan pulled out for no good reason.""

Miami-Dade and Broward are at the ""epicenter of the nation's HIV epidemic"" and it has ""gotten worse during Scott's term,'' Canady said. AHF wants its advocates and patients to be able ""to let the governor hear not just from our staff but the people impacted by him and his team"" that the decision could be disruptive to many fragile patients who must now find new doctors, he said.

The company asked the governor's office for a series of public records, including those ""showing meetings and travel plans involving Governor Scott for the period July 20, 2018 through October 31, 2018.""

It asked for all electronic and hard copies of calendars ""showing all meetings, events, and appearances involving the governor."" And it asked for Scott's future travel plans, where he will reside and ""a list of all campaign and fundraising events Governor Scott will attend as part of his campaign for U.S. Senate.""

Scott's office refused. It cited the public records law and as simply the office is ""unable to provide these records at this time as they are exempt pursuant to 119.071(2)(d) F.S.""

AHF contends the response violated the law on several counts and also doesn't make sense.

Scott's office ""failed to explain how its cited exemption was applicable, especially in light of the fact that the governor's schedule is a public record, has been produced previously before, and is typically emailed out to the public and press on a daily basis,'' states the lawsuit.

Scott not only does not release many details about how he spends his day as governor, his campaign also provides few advanced details about where he will be while campaigning. He excludes from the public schedule meetings with lobbyists and their clients and rarely, if ever, acknowledges fundraisers.

Previous governors released their schedules the day ahead. Scott's office releases his schedule hours into the day, occasionally releasing an updated version of the schedule to highlight a last-minute addition but usually after the event occurred.

Scott travels at his own expense on a Cessna Citation Excel purchased in 2013 by the company controlled by Scott's wife, Columbia Collier Properties. Because of his lack of disclosure, there is no way to know if Scott invites campaign staff, lobbyists or others on his plane or travels with other elected officials.

When he arrives in a city and has unscheduled time, Scott has been known to call lobbyists and ask to meet with them or their clients. His schedule is not updated to reflect those meetings.

""In trying to ascertain where Gov Scott is, it is has been nearly impossible,'' Canady said. ""There is no public record of his actual schedule. No public indication of where he's going — except post-dated reports of where he's been … What it says to me is there's something the governor and his team wants to hide.""",26/07/2018
Tampa Bay Times,How can City Hall improve our health? A new push in Pinellas hopes to show the way.,"The charitable organization that owns a 20 percent stake in St. Petersburgs Bayfront Health hospital is working with local governments to improve the publics health, part of a strategy to make a difference in new and often subtle ways.

The Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg on Wednesday announced its ""Health In All Policies"" project, aimed at getting local officials to think more deeply about the impact of their decisions, large and small, on residents well-being. Over the next three years, the foundation will spend $1.55 million to hire three planners who will join the staffs of the city of Pinellas Park, the city of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County government.

Their job: educate local policymakers on how the publics health is affected by the laws they pass and the decisions they make, from paving a street to making a zoning change. The funding also will provide support for the Health Department in Pinellas County.

""Fifty percent of our health is influenced outside of the doctors office,"" said Sandra Whitehead, who spoke at the announcement on behalf of the National Environmental Health Association. ""Health is determined by more than just access and exercise. This is why social support from the community is so important. Being able to bike or walk safely in your city comes from policy, which affects our health.""

The Health In All Policies platform was created the American Public Health Association, the Public Health Institute and the California Department of Public Health. Pinellas County is the first in the United States to use the platform to employ city workers. Washington D.C., Kansas City, Mo., and Louisville, Ky., also have active Health In All Policies programs.

Local officials, including St. Petersburg City Council chair Darden Rice, Pinellas Park Vice Mayor Patricia Johnson and Whit Blanton, executive director of Forward Pinellas, stressed the need for affordable, easy-to-use public transit and more pedestrian and bike-friendly roads for residents.

""It is a great challenge to connect all of our walkable downtowns and eliminate food deserts,"" Blanton said.

Officials say they know it will take some time to institute real change that will benefit residents.

""There are 24 cities here and only four county-wide systems,"" said Randall Russell, CEO of the foundation, referring to entities like the school district and sheriffs office. ""This is just the beginning, but its going to take a long time.""

RELATED: HIV is on the rise in Florida and young people dont seem to care

The foundations three-year commitment to fund the health policies project comes on the heels of the countys latest health needs assessment, which the local health department also released on Wednesday. Health department officials collected data from more than 700 Pinellas residents last year, as well as national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Census Bureau, to compile a report outlining the state of health in the county, including its pitfalls and promise.

The leading causes of death in Pinellas County continue to be heart disease and cancer, which is in line with the rest of the country. But the number of unintentional deaths, like from car accidents, is now third on the list. Suicide in Pinellas County is exceptionally high compared to the state average, and the county has surpassed the states average in the number of suicides reported each year since 2011.

In 2016, for example, Pinellas reported 214 suicides, a rate of 19.6 suicides for every 100,000 residents. The state rate was 14.1 suicides per 100,000.

The health assessment also showed that only 34.7 percent of adults living in Pinellas County are at a healthy weight. More than 60 percent of survey responders fit into the overweight or obese categories.

Because of these results, the health department has identified access to care, mental health and substance abuse, access to transportation, socioeconomic factors and collaborative partnerships as its priorities for 2018.

""Data can only do so much,"" said Dr. Ulyee Choe, director of the Health Department in Pinellas. ""Data needs to be useful, but most of all, actionable. So were talking about how we can use it to be part of the solutions.""

The last county health assessment was completed in 2014. Individual hospitals often conduct their own health needs assessments as well.

The Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg uses grants and other activities to improve the health of people with limited means and little access to health care. Earlier this summer it announced a $2.2 million grant aimed at reducing the rate of HIV infections in Pinellas County by 50 percent in three years. It also will open a Social Change Center in the Lakeview shopping plaza at 2333 34th St. S, to provide meeting space for its employees and community partners next year.

City officials instituted the need for the foundation in 2013 when the hospital then known as Bayfront Medical Center was bought by a for-profit chain. The profits from the sale were used to seed the charitable organization that was meant to carry out Bayfronts mission as the citys oldest and largest hospital.

The foundation oversees a $170 million endowment. But the for-profit chain that bought the hospital, Health Management Associates, was quickly acquired by another chain, Community Health Systems, and the foundation drifted into the background for several years.

RELATED: Charitable arm looks to separate from Bayfront Health. Could a sale of the hospital be next?

In 2016, the foundation awarded $4 million grants to 19 nonprofit organizations for the first time, including $161,575 to Family Resources, Inc. for an LGBTQ homeless youth project and $30,000 to the Pinellas County Urban League for a clergy mental health roundtable series. Last year, it offered grants ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 to 29 local organizations for various community health programs.

Also last year, the foundation went before the St. Petersburg City Council to try to separate itself from the hospital, but city officials derailed plans to change the ownership structure and the foundations chance to become independent from Bayfront Health.

Tampa Bay Times,"Legalized smokable medical pot won’t happen anytime soon in Florida, court rules","Chiding a judge who sided with sick patients and saying plaintiffs likely won't win on the merits of the case, an appellate court on Tuesday refused to allow smokable medical marijuana while a legal fight continues to play out.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal came in a lawsuit initiated by Orlando trial attorney John Morgan and others who maintain that a Florida law barring patients from smoking their treatment runs afoul of a 2016 constitutional amendment that broadly legalized medical marijuana.

Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers in May agreed with Morgan, who largely bankrolled the constitutional amendment, and plaintiffs in the case. The state appealed, touching off legal maneuvering that led to the appellate panel Tuesday issuing a five-page decision that effectively blocked Gievers' ruling while the case continues.

""I respect the 1st DCA immensely, but no matter what, this goes to the Supreme Court, so why not now,"" Morgan, who has repeatedly called on Gov. Rick Scott to drop the state's appeal, said in an email Tuesday. ""It is just a waste of time and taxpayer money. Cathy Jordan may die as this snails its way through the system. All of this proves why people don't trust politicians. They know what they voted for.""

Cathy Jordan, one of the plaintiffs in the case, credits a daily regimen of smoking marijuana with keeping her alive decades after doctors predicted she would die from Lou Gehrig's disease. Jordan, who grows her own pot, testified that smoking marijuana treats a variety of life-threatening side effects of the disease and that other forms of ingestion don't have the same positive impact.

Gievers agreed with lawyers representing Jordan and the other plaintiffs. They contended that it was understood that the constitutional amendment allowed smoking, though it did not expressly authorize it.

State health officials, who answer to Scott, immediately appealed Gievers' May 25 ruling, automatically putting her decision on hold. On June 5, Gievers lifted the stay, saying Jordan and Diana Dodson, a plaintiff who has neuralgia associated with HIV, would suffer without having access to smokable marijuana.

On the other hand, ""there is no evidence the defendants (the state) will suffer harm if the stay is vacated,"" the judge wrote.

""Lifting the stay preserves the status quo by returning the law to its previous state as it existed following the 2016 adoption of the constitutional medical marijuana rights"" and before the 2017 law went into effect, she added.

But the appeals court Tuesday quashed Gievers' decision to lift the stay and directly contradicted the circuit judge. Appellate judges Joseph Lewis, Lori Rowe and M. Kemmerly Thomas found that the plaintiffs ""failed to demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm if the automatic stay is reinstated.""

Noting that a trial court may vacate an automatic stay only ""under the most compelling circumstances,"" the judges also scolded Gievers, saying ""it was an abuse of discretion for the circuit court"" to lift the stay.

Even more, the panel signaled bleak prospects for Morgan and the plaintiffs, at least as far as the appellate court — which also rejected a request to rush the case to the Florida Supreme Court — is concerned.

""Here, after the panel's preliminary review of the wording of the medical marijuana amendment and the statute prohibiting the use of medical marijuana in a smokable form, we conclude that appellees (the plaintiffs) have not sufficiently demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits as required to justify vacating the automatic stay,"" the judges wrote.

The 2016 amendment ""authorized medical marijuana for qualifying patients with certain debilitating medical conditions but authorized DOH (the state Department of Health) to issue reasonable regulations to ensure the availability and safe use of medical marijuana by qualifying patients,"" Tuesday's order said.

In addition, the judges pointed out that the amendment provides that ""(n)othing in this section shall limit the Legislature from enacting laws consistent with this section.""

The judges noted that Gievers and the appellate court also have been at odds in a separate lawsuit filed by Tampa strip club owner Joe Redner, a lung-cancer survivor who wanted the state to allow him to grow his own medical marijuana for juicing purposes. Gievers sided with Redner, but, as in the smokable marijuana challenge, health officials' appeal put her ruling on hold.

The appellate court in Redner's case, mirroring Tuesday's order, upheld the automatic stay, deciding that he had little chance of winning on the merits of his case. And the appeals court also refused to speed up his case by moving it to the Supreme Court.

The legal tangle over whether patients should be able to smoke marijuana — one of at least eight marijuana-related legal or administrative challenges about the state's burgeoning cannabis industry — is also playing out on the political stage in Florida.

Morgan, a political rainmaker who supported Hillary Clinton for president and who toyed with the idea of running for Florida governor as a Democrat or an independent, has framed smokable medical marijuana as a make-or-break issue in Scott's general election contest against incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Nelson has also come out in support of allowing patients to smoke medical marijuana.

""This is not surprising and why it should go to the Supreme Court now,"" Morgan tweeted Tuesday, referring to the 1st District Court of Appeal order. ""It's not a matter of if but when. So why waste taxpayers money. Vacating a stay is impossible. This issue will haunt @FLGovScott in November when his 'stay' will be over!""",05/07/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Erasure’s Andy Bell opens up about finding love in laid-back Tampa,"Andy Bell didnt come to Tampa expecting to find love.

The Erasure singer had just emerged from a two-decade relationship with his partner and manager, Paul Hickey, with whom he was still close. Both were HIV-positive  Hickey was diagnosed in 1990, Bell in 1998.

Then, in the summer of 2010, Bell booked a gig at the Honey Pot, an Ybor City gay club owned by Stephen Moss.

""I had just done Dallas Pride, and then flew to Tampa on my own,"" Bell said by phone recently. ""I saw Steve, and I think Id been up all night the night before. He said, Do you want to go to dinner? I said, No, lets get some rest before the show. I just remember thinking, Whos this strange person? And thats what happened when I met my previous partner, 23 years earlier: Whos this strange person? I think that must be my keyword.""

Eight years later, Bell and Moss are still a couple. They keep a place in Tampa, where Bell sometimes lives when Erasure isnt on the road. And that makes their concert Saturday at St. Petersburgs Mahaffey Theater something of a hometown show.

""Theres quite a few people that we know there,"" said Bell, 54. ""I dont know if they will make it across the bridge from Tampa, but I hope they do.""

Floridas long been a solid market for the British synth-pop duo, thanks to the club- and remix-friendly nature of their music. Since 1985, Bell and band mate Vince Clarke, formerly of Depeche Mode, have scored a handful of hit singles, including Always, A Little Respect and Chains of Love.

But they werent really ""MTV popular,"" Bell said. ""We were like VH1 after-hours programming.""

But they were always beloved in the LGBTQ community. Clarke is straight, but Bell, the groups ebullient frontman, has been openly gay since Erasure began.

""We were playing Pride (events) in the late 80s, 86 and 87, and before that I was going to Pride on my own in London,"" he said. ""We didnt have sponsors in those days. It seemed more like a community thing rather than a business-oriented thing. I saw in London just how the thing grew so much, and became so huge.""

Bell has likewise seen corners of the music industry come around to Erasures buoyant, glittery sound.

""We had all these amazing remixes done of our stuff, so it was great when we were touring around North America and going to clubs, and it was much more cultish and underground,"" he said. ""And now, thats kind of where people start with their tracks. You almost have to be a dance track or a club track to get radio play. Its swung around in the opposite direction. Its kind of like electro is the new rock.""

Bell these days finds himself listening to more rock, like AC/DC or Motorhead, than he ever did as a kid.

""As you get older, you really appreciate dad music,"" he said. ""I think anyone thats still wandering around in their leathers and tight jeans and stuff, doing their head-banging without hair, is really quite cool.""

In a way, Bells life with Moss in Tampa fits this more relaxed M.O. They also keep apartments in Miami and Atlanta, and for tax purposes, Bell cant live more than 180 days in America in any three-year cycle. But Bell likes Tampa specifically because its nothing like the crowded hustle of London. Here, he and Moss can escape into local hangouts like Fly Bar or Ciros Speakeasy.

""I like it because its quite sleepy and its quite cosmopolitan at the same time, and very open and fresh,"" he said. ""Its nice to go somewhere where theres not that many people. I like the relaxedness, that you can order food in, and just go out wandering around the mall and stuff like that. We go to the cinema, which is not necessarily a thing I would do when Im here in London because I dont drive. Its nice having a partner that does.""

Bell feels ""really, really blessed"" in his current relationship with Moss, who has a ""sunny, laid-back disposition"" that he believes comes from being a native Floridian. That support proved important in 2012, when Hickey, a Californian with a similar disposition, passed away.

""I was there right at the end, and I must say it was one of the most painful experiences of my whole life,"" Bell said. ""It just makes you realize how short life is, and how much you need to appreciate people when theyre here, living in the moment. It sounds corny, but its the truth. None of your valuables or whatever you have on this earth can you take with you. So you might as well enjoy it while youre here.""

Tampa Bay Times,The Daystarter: USF tightens admissions standards; Eckerd addresses foster care failures; Rays finish homestand 8-1,"Catching you up on overnight happenings, and what to know today.

 As we approach the 4th of July, well see the usual mix of steamy weather and afternoon thundershowers this week, according to 10Weather WTSP. Daytime highs will be near 90, with overnight lows staying in the high 70s.

 As you head out for your morning commute, check out our live blog for the latest traffic updates and road conditions across Tampa Bay.

 HIV is on the rise in Florida, raising concern among advocates as it makes an unwelcome comeback in the state. While the stigma has lifted somewhat and effective treatments have lessened much of the danger, the disease no longer presses on the public consciousness as it once did, Justine Griffin writes. Florida continues to rank at or near the top nationally for HIV diagnoses, with Pinellas and Hillsborough counties among the regions that are considered hotbeds of activity. And local health officials say they are seeing more cases among people in their early teens to early 20s.

The University of South Florida is tightening admissions standards in its continuing push to achieve and maintain ""preeminent"" status with the state. By the fall of 2019, the average incoming freshman at USF will have a high school GPA of 4.1, an ACT score of at least 29 and an SAT score of at least 1283  pretty impressive numbers. At USF St. Petersburg, the average GPA will rise from 3.8 to 4.0. While this will lead to an increase in status for USF, it will also keep many students out, Claire McNeill reports. And that will lead to concerns about whether the big local university, an important stepping stone for tens of thousands of Tampa Bay area residents over the years, will be less accessible to lower performing but still-deserving students.

 For the first time in 45 years, Pinellas County officials will oversee the agency that regulates thousands of licensed contractors. Starting today, the Pinellas County Construction Licensing Board  which had been Floridas only independent construction board  fades into the history books after years of mismanagement, misbehavior and minimal oversight, Mark Puente writes. The old agency was created by the Legislature in 1973. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a new law putting the licensing department under the eyes of the Pinellas County Commission. Besides getting a new leader, the agency hired three investigators to help tackle the problem of unlicensed contractors ripping off homeowners. Theyll also move to new offices by the end of July. ""Theres a new face,"" said Glenn Wardell, the county employee running the agency. ""There will be much more engaged management and supervision.""

 Even as Eckerd Connects reveals plans to address foster care failures in Hillsborough County, its officials acknowledged this week that some foster teens are still sleeping in offices. Chief of Community Care Chris Card told Eckerd board members this week that the agency is still dealing with the problem that led the state to put it on notice that it could lose its contract. Eckerd will today send a corrective action plan to the Florida Department of Children and Families that includes the creation of a 24/7 mental health crisis response team and an increased focus on keeping children in the home. Read Christopher ODonnells story this morning on tampabay.com.

 State House hopeful Susan Valdes is battling backlash from her own political party, the Democrats. The reason: As a Hillsborough County School Board member, she accepted more than $12,000 in campaign contributions in 2016 from charter schools operators. Things got so heated at a party event last weekend that an assistant state attorney has accused Valdes and her campaign manager of threatening behavior. Read more from Marlene Sokol.

 They celebrated Canada Day in Ybor City on Sunday. The Dirty Shame bar hosted a local celebration Sunday of our northern neighbors Independence Day for the areas Canadian community for a second straight year.

Chief among them is increasing the minimum wage and banning assault weapons. But one of Levines opponents in 2018 Democratic primary says Levines achievements arent as successful as he sometimes makes it seem.

5 p.m.

Pride is an excuse to dress outrageously — and celebrate who you are, according to Rowan Clarke and Ash Athey.

Both Clarke and Athey went with makeup-inspired looks. Clarke described hers as a “cross between 80s punk demon versus goddess.”

The two came not only to have a good time and hang out with friends, but to support and represent the community.

“I feel like I’m with my family. Everyone is really nice, really accepting,” Clarke said.

Athey added that regardless if someone is a member of the LGBTQ community, or just an ally, Pride is filled with accepting individuals willing to embrace the gay community.

Athey said that events like this are important to the community because they remind people that “it’s OK to be different.” She also said that they can help create a sense of support for people struggling to come out to their families.

“The more people know it’s OK to be yourself, the better off we are,” Clarke said.

4:44 p.m.

The feeling of acceptance will always be greater at Pride, St. Petersburg resident Samantha Wolfkill said.

The 26 year old comes every year and usually walks in the parade. But this year she’s taking a step back to really take it all in.

“Our community has fought so hard for this and it’s a time to celebrate and embrace one another,” she said.

3:21 p.m.

Mariah Woessner, 26, of Orlando, was hesitant to come to Pride.

She has a lot going on and her anxiety was starting to flare up. It just seemed like another thing to deal with.

But then she thought about how her friend who invited her would feel.

“I couldn’t disappoint her. She’s my best friend. I jokingly call her my wife but I swear we’re going to get married one day,” Woessner said.

So, she pulled herself together and pushed outside her comfort zone to make the trek from Orlando.

And she’s happy she did.

“When you’re not here, you forget how you love it,” she said. “When you’re at Pride, you just forget about the bad or anything going on on your life and just have fun and feel accepted.”

Chris Gardner was never ashamed of being gay, per se. He just didn’t broadcast it.

He didn’t hold hands or embrace his significant other in public. But over the past 16 years, that’s changed.

Gardner has attended St. Pete Pride since it began. He’s seen it blossom into the largest Pride event in the Southeast. He’s seen it transform the gay community and transform himself, he said.

Gardener and his husband of 10 years don’t second guess themselves walking hand in hand down the street anymore.

“I’m literally proud,” Gardner said. “I’m proud to be married to a man. And Pride has done that.”

Chris Gardner, 55 from St. Pete, is working this weekend, as he does at every Pride, at the Epic Empath Partners and Care HIV Services van. He's helping educate people about the disease and encourage them to get tested. He said about 40-50 a day do it throughout the weekend. ""It's not just a gay disease, everyone who has sex should get tested,"" he said. [McKenna Oxenden | Tampa Bay Times]

2 p.m. Saturday, Central Ave.

Kevin Raike doesn’t remember last year’s Pride. He was in the hospital. His organs had started shutting down.

Doctors eventually removed more than 67 pounds of excess fluid from his body, Raike, 52, said. They told him his kidney disorder would kill him, but they didn’t know when. He and his spouse, Kevin Back, went to Kentucky, where they’re both from, so he could say goodbye to family and friends.

A year later, Raike sleeps in a hospital bed and Back in the recliner next to him. Their lives have changed, but so much has. The world is a different place than the one Raike came out to 41 years ago. And he’s still here.

After all of it, he says, he feels free.

1:06 p.m. Saturday, Central Ave.

Inside Buku Tattoo Studio, 33-year-old Andrew Richards was giving his last tattoo of the day.

Sunday, when the street fair takes over this strip of Central Avenue, the shop would be slammed, Richards, who is gay, guessed. That was the norm, “being in the Gayborhood,” he said. But soon, he’d take the rest of the day off and head to the parade.

The constant barrage of news over the past two years might darken the mood slightly, he said. But he didn’t think it would hamper the celebration “for how far we’ve come.”

“There are still people who don’t accept it,” he said, and jerked his gloved thumb at the spot across the street where an anti-gay protester had just stood. “It gives us a chance to stand our ground.”



12:45 p.m. Saturday, Central Ave.

Outside Old Key West Bar & Grill, the artist Lady Galaxy surveyed a kaleidoscope of spray paint cans.

Galaxy — government name: Nikki Sunderland — said the art, pieces of which take her three to eight minutes to complete, reflects her distaste with boundaries and boxes.

Though she’s dated people of different genders, she doesn’t put a label on her sexuality. Her mother identified as a lesbian, she said, but Sunderland later found out how limiting she found the word.

Sunderland grew up going to pride festivities with her mother, and though she said she’s still sad about the parade’s move from the Grand Central District to the downtown waterfront, she’s still excited to use her art as a gateway to get to know passers-by.

“I paint their soul,” she said. “Ninety percent of the time, I hit it.”

Tampa Bay Times,HIV is on the rise in Florida and young people don’t seem to care,"Robert Marquez was 18 when he got the news that would change his life forever.

He was HIV positive.

""I knew nothing about it outside of it being a gay disease like my conservative parents and pastor said about it,"" said Marquez, now 20. ""But now, I know thats not true. It can affect anyone. But its also possible to live a long, normal life.""

His case is one example of a double-edged reality that has raised concern among advocates as HIV makes an unwelcome comeback in Florida. While the stigma has lifted somewhat and effective treatments have lessened much of the danger, the disease no longer presses on the public consciousness like it once did.

That and a lack of public information have contributed to a rise in cases among a new generation of young people who never knew the fear that HIV evoked in earlier times.

Florida continues to rank at or near the top nationally for HIV diagnoses, with Pinellas and Hillsborough counties among the regions that are considered hotbeds of activity. And local health officials say they are seeing more cases among people in their early teens to early 20s.

""Yes, HIV is more manageable these days, but its on the rise again. Younger people are being diagnosed and dont seem to understand the consequences or know the history of the stigma behind HIV and AIDS,"" said Lorraine Langlois, CEO of Metro Wellness & Community Centers, a network of health care facilities that specialize in LBGTQ services around Tampa Bay.

While state health officials typically dont release HIV data in real time, many available numbers support what advocates say they are seeing in their centers.

According to the Florida Department of Health, the number of HIV diagnoses:

 Increased 8 percent statewide among people of all ages from 2014 to 2016.

 Shot up 20 percent from 2007 to 2016 for people in their 20s across the state.

 Rose significantly over the same nine years for people in their 20s in Tampa Bay. The increase was 28 percent in Pinellas and Pasco counties, and 23 percent in Hillsborough County.

Nationally, people ages 13 to 24 accounted for 21 percent of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. in 2016, with most of those occurring among those who are 20 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Many of them are not using condoms, a problem that has only worsened in the last decade. In a CDC survey last year, only 54 percent of sexually active high school students said they used condoms the last time they had intercourse, down from 61 percent in 2007.

ALSO READ: A transgender man in search of hormone therapy, he turned to Planned Parenthood

Health care groups and advocates around Tampa Bay say they are responding to the trend with expanded services and new public health campaigns focusing on HIV prevention, including the need to use condoms.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation opened a new medical clinic this week in St. Petersburgs Skyway Marina District, where it will offer medical care and services to patients regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.

""The need for medical care and services for HIV/AIDS patients in St. Petersburg remains significant, with both Florida and St. Petersburg repeatedly landing at the top of HIV and/or AIDS incidence and rates nationally,"" said Dr. Jeanette Cancel, AHF Tampa Bay medical director.

Also this week, the Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg announced a ""Zero Pinellas"" partnership and a $2.2 million grant that aims to reduce the number of new HIV infections in Pinellas County by 50 percent within the next three years.

""Its the millennial generation, living in this age of technology and social media, which can be difficult to grab their attention,"" said Imara Canady, regional director of communications and community engagement for AHF. ""Theyre pulled in so many directions, and traditional academic ways of messaging just doesnt work anymore.""

The way young people meet and engage with one another has changed the way sex plays a role in relationships, too.

""People can be dating online for two weeks, and when theyre in the same room with someone for the first time, they already feel like they know them,"" Canady said. ""Because that dating practice is accelerating, it makes sex a more risky experience.""

It doesnt help that sex education has been reduced or eliminated in school systems because of a lack of funding, Canady said.

""People arent dying anymore from HIV and AIDS, so theres no more sense of urgency around the epidemic,"" said Tracy Jones, national director for grassroots mobilization at the AHF. ""Theres a generation of young people who have lived with HIV their whole lives, which represents something different entirely than those who were diagnosed just hours away from death.""

Treatment for AIDS and HIV changed significantly in the mid 1990s, said Dr. Stephanie Marhefka-Day, a professor at the University of South Florida who has studied HIV for decades.

""Medicine changed the outcome greatly at this time, but it was not a great time for quality of life for people living with HIV,"" she said, noting there were many pills to manage, which caused severe side effects.

That, too, has since changed. Multiple medications can be used to manage symptoms of HIV patients on an individual level without so many side effects, she said.

A controversial new prevention drug called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is becoming increasingly popular within gay and transgender communities to lower the chance of becoming infected through sex or injections.

""The benefit is allowing HIV-positive people to have a relationship, to realize their sexual selves again, and for it to be less stigmatized, which is amazing,"" Marhefka-Day said. ""But from a research perspective, there are a lot of dollars going toward PrEP and a cure, which is great. But we could use more funding toward the behavioral side of prevention, like reminding people to wear condoms and to understand the risks.""

MORE HEALTH COVERAGE:Pregnancy centers draw scrutiny as lawmakers seek to elevate their status

While it may be easier to live with HIV clinically, the stigma behind the disease is still alive and well, especially in places such as Florida, Marhefka-Day said.

""It may be less so with young people, but unfortunately, there are still people who dont want to live with HIV-positive patients, or want to touch plates theyve eaten off, or theyre afraid to share a bathroom with them,"" she said. ""People still dont understand how HIV is transmitted.""

Thats what Jonathan Hill remembers. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1998 while he was incarcerated at the Hillsborough County jail. While Hill was married to a woman at the time, he was taking drugs and drinking, and later would come out as a gay man.

""I thought I was going to have to call my family and prepare them for my death,"" Hill said.

Now 49, he sees his doctor twice a year and takes medicine daily. He uses condoms with his second wife, a transgender performer named Sierra. They have been married since 2016, and she is not HIV positive.

""She didnt know much about how you could catch it at first,"" Hill said. ""But she was willing to learn more.""

Hill likes to talk to young people who come into Metro Wellness and the Youth Clinic in Ybor about life with HIV.

""Its 2018 and Im still here. I can eat what I want. I dont look sickly and frail,"" he said. ""But young people need to stop trying to be Superman. PrEP is great, but it doesnt protect you from other STDs. So use a condom.""

Robert Marquez wasnt sure which partner passed HIV onto him.

""I have two cousins with lupus, so I regularly donated plasma at a local clinic for them,"" he said. ""One day, I was told I couldnt donate anymore because I was HIV positive.""

He confirmed the diagnosis with a physician at the Metro Wellness clinic in Ybor City. When he knew for sure, he was devastated.

""I didnt know what I was going to do. But I started researching it to learn,"" he said. ""It didnt make me feel better, but it gave me hope.""

Marquez, who was born in Miami but grew up in Tampa, now works as a prevention specialist at Metro Wellness. He coaches young people by telling them what he went through, and hes healthy enough to pursue passions like playing piano, singing and dancing. Marquezs current partner is HIV negative, and he takes PrEP.

""I get to have goals, like plan for school and traveling the world and hopefully one day getting engaged and getting married,"" he said. ""This was a wake-up call. Im lucky I get to live a normal life, but its taught me to be careful and to educate myself.""

Tampa Bay Times,Tuesday’s letters: Keep programs that fight AIDS,"For author Biden, its a fathers gift | June 6

Keep programs that fight AIDS

After former Vice President Joe Bidens recent visit to St. Petersburg, I noticed an article that he co-wrote with former Sen. Bill Frist. It reminded everyone about the importance of not cutting off funding for AIDS-related programs, as we mark the 15th anniversary of the Presidents Emergency Plan For Aids Relief, or PEPFAR. Thanks to bipartisan leadership 15 years ago, more than 13.3 million people, including 1 million children around the world, are receiving life-saving anti-retroviral treatment because of PEPFAR. Support for PEPFAR, coupled with scientific advances, has the potential to turn the tide on HIV/AIDS. Every day we are closer to achieving an AIDS-free generation. With the current administration trying to make cuts to global health and humanitarian programs, my fear is that PEPFAR will become a program of the past. I hope everyone will urge their members of Congress to support its continued funding.

A sabotage of health care | Editorial, June 17

We deserve good health care

Although I am fortunate be a basically healthy 83-year-old and to have a wonderful doctor who does not use me as a money machine by prescribing a lot of new drugs or unnecessary procedures, many seniors are in a far different situation and need the assurance that pre-existing conditions will be covered by their insurance. Americans, even young, healthy ones who do not need medical care yet, all have to vote carefully and elect only men and women who will rein in outrageous costs. Good care should not be only for the rich. It is a human right. Men and women in Congress have wonderful medical coverage and get the best of care. I happen to like myself and think I deserve the same. What about you?

Doing the math | Letter, June 17

Protect the most vulnerable

Social Security is not only a retirement plan. Although 71 percent is paid out that way, the other 29 percent pays for survivors benefits and disability. This protects our most vulnerable, which any of us could become overnight. Someone who makes $128,400 pays $2,308 towards those less fortunate. Someone who makes 10 times more pays no more. Shouldnt someone who has benefited so greatly from this society be willing to pay the same proportionate share?

State jobless rate 3.8% | June 16

Plenty of low-wage jobs

The 3.8 percent unemployment rate was front-page news. The next day, away from the big headlines, was a report that $21.50 an hour is needed to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Florida. When you consider that those low-wage workers cant really contribute to the local economy in a meaningful way, 3.8 percent unemployment isnt really such a big deal after all, is it?

Tampa Bay Times,Laura Bush: Separating children from their parents at the border breaks my heart’,"On Sunday, a day we as a nation set aside to honor fathers and the bonds of family, I was among the millions of Americans who watched images of children who have been torn from their parents.

In the six weeks between April 19 and May 31, the Department of Homeland Security has sent nearly 2,000 children to mass detention centers or foster care. More than 100 of these children are younger than 4 years old. The reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our borders.

I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.

Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. We also know that this treatment inflicts trauma; interned Japanese have been two times as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely than those who were not interned.

RELATED: Rick Scott: I oppose separating families at border, but chaos due to inaction on border security

Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation, on being the nation that sends humanitarian relief to places devastated by natural disasters or famine or war. We pride ourselves on believing that people should be seen for the content of their character, not the color of their skin. We pride ourselves on acceptance. If we are truly that country, then it is our obligation to reunite these detained children with their parents  and to stop separating parents and children in the first place.

People on all sides agree that our immigration system isnt working, but the injustice of zero tolerance is not the answer. I moved away from Washington almost a decade ago, but I know there are good people at all levels of government who can do better to fix this.

Recently, Colleen Kraft, who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics, visited a shelter run by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. She reported that while there were beds, toys, crayons, a playground and diaper changes, the people working at the shelter had been instructed not to pick up or touch the children to comfort them. Imagine not being able to pick up a child who is not yet out of diapers.

Twenty-nine years ago, my mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, visited Grandmas House, a home for children with HIV/AIDS in Washington. Back then, at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis, the disease was a death sentence, and most babies born with it were considered ""untouchables."" During her visit, Barbara  who was the first lady at the time  picked up a fussy, dying baby named Donovan and snuggled him against her shoulder to soothe him. My mother-in-law never viewed her embrace of that fragile child as courageous. She simply saw it as the right thing to do in a world that can be arbitrary, unkind and even cruel. She, who after the death of her 3-year-old daughter knew what it was to lose a child, believed that every child is deserving of human kindness, compassion and love.

In 2018, can we not as a nation find a kinder, more compassionate and more moral answer to this current crisis? I, for one, believe we can.

Tampa Bay Times,Smokable medical pot on hold after appeals court sides with Florida,"In a widely expected move, an appellate court Monday refused to lift a stay on a Tallahassee judge's ruling that would allow patients to smoke medical marijuana if their doctors approve it.

The 1st District Court of Appeal's decision means that patients will continue to be barred from legally smoking medical marijuana for the foreseeable future — at least until the appellate court issues a final ruling on the merits of the case.

Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers last month sided with Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan and a group of plaintiffs who filed a legal challenge after the Legislature included a ban on smoking in a 2017 law carrying out a constitutional amendment broadly legalizing medical marijuana.

Gievers agreed that the text of the constitutional amendment, approved by 72 percent of Floridians in 2016, allows patients to use any form of marijuana as their treatment.

Health officials, who argued that the amendment did not expressly authorize smoking and that the state had broad leeway to regulate medical marijuana use, immediately filed an appeal, which put an automatic stay on Gievers' May 25 ruling.

On June 6, Gievers vacated the stay, prompting the state to ask the appellate court to keep it in place. The court sided with the state on Monday, saying that Gievers' order vacating the stay was ""quashed"" and that the hold ""shall remain in effect pending final disposition of the merits of this appeal.""

Whether patients should be able to smoke marijuana if their doctors recommend it has set off a partisan firestorm, with Morgan — a political rainmaker and registered Democrat who largely bankrolled the 2016 constitutional amendment — stirring the political pot.

Morgan told The News Service of Florida he had expected the appellate court to keep Gievers' ruling on hold.

""Not surprised. Rick Scott could end the appeal today. It will cost him his Senate bid. The makers of opioids are cheering him on,"" Morgan wrote in an email Monday.

Morgan has repeatedly asked Scott to drop the appeal, warning that the governor's opposition to smokable medical marijuana will alienate moderate Republicans and independents in the governor's quest to oust U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in November.

Nelson, a Democrat, recently came out in support of doctor-ordered smokable marijuana for sick patients, as have each of the Democratic candidates seeking to replace Scott as governor.

In her June 5 order lifting the stay, Gievers wrote that plaintiffs Cathy Jordan, a Lou Gehrig's disease patient who credits smoking marijuana with saving her life, and Diana Dodson, who has neuralgia associated with HIV, would suffer without having access to smokable marijuana.

""Individual patients Jordan and Dodson are exposed to irreparable harm on two fronts. First, they cannot legally access the treatment recommended for them. Second, they face potential criminal prosecution for possession and use of the medicinal substance,"" the judge wrote.

On the other hand, ""there is no evidence the defendants (the state) will suffer harm if the stay is vacated,"" the judge wrote.

""Lifting the stay preserves the status quo by returning the law to its previous state as it existed following the 2016 adoption of the constitutional medical marijuana rights"" and before the 2017 law went into effect, she added.

But during a hearing before Gievers, Assistant Attorney General Karen Brodeen argued that there was no hurry for the stay to be lifted, in part because of a lengthy state rulemaking process. Smokable pot ""won't be available for a long time,"" if the courts ultimately decide that it is legal, Brodeen said.

""There's no irreparable harm here. Nobody, at this time, can go to a medical-marijuana treatment center and purchase smokable marijuana. That's going to take several months down the road, after an order that requires it to be available,"" she said.

The legal tangle over smokable medical marijuana is one of at least eight marijuana-related administrative or legal challenges about the state's burgeoning cannabis industry, which some experts estimate could exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2020.

Tampa Bay Times,"In St. Pete, kidney patients gather for science and solidarity","ST. PETERSBURG  Kidney disease doesnt discriminate.

The crowd of more than 200 patients who gathered at the Vinoy Renaissance St. Petersburg Resort range in age from teenagers to seniors. They are of different ethnicities and come from all over the country.

They all have this in common: they were diagnosed with a kidney disease.

There are more than 40 million people affected by chronic kidney disease in the U.S. alone, making the American Association of Kidney Patients one of the largest patient organizations in America. Patients, caregivers, doctors and government officials gathered in St. Petersburg for the groups 43rd annual National Patient Meeting this weekend.

Some patients strolled the hallways of the historic bayfront Vinoy with dialysis bags dangling from their belt buckles. Others stepped out of the conference rooms to attend dialysis appointments at nearby facilities.

Unlike most corporate conference settings where food is limited, the breakfast and lunch menus offered wide-ranging choices to accommodate those on strict diets. Food like pizza or beans or even soda can be out of the question for some dialysis patients. Rice milk replaced traditional milk and cream at the coffee bar.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: All her life, everyday foods threatened her health. Then came a new drug, tested at USF.

""This meeting is a way for us to bring patients together and educate them on trends that could affect their own health,"" association president Paul Conway said. He was diagnosed with kidney failure at 16, and spent two years on dialysis before receiving an organ transplant.

""A cool thing thats happening now, is a lot of our members meet each other online through social media, then come to the conference,"" he said.

As an advocacy group that pushes for lower drug costs and more funding for research, much of the groups agenda focuses on new medical trends that affect kidney research and treatment.

Conway described the present as an ""exciting time"" for kidney disease research, with discussions of new drugs to slow down the process of kidney failure, and artificial implantable kidneys on the horizon. Another hot issue for the association this year is working with insurance companies to stop labeling organ donors as having a pre-existing medical condition, which Conway said is a strong deterrent or recruiting people to donate.

""Research has been stagnant for a long time in kidney disease,"" he said. ""Cancer, HIV and heart disease lead the way in medical innovation. Dialysis is still the main form of treatment for patients, as its been for decades, but were hoping that will change soon.""

Sandeep Patel of the federal Health and Human Services Department discussed on Friday a new nationwide project called ""KidneyX"" aimed at spurring new innovation for the treatment of kidney disease.

""Unlike cancer, theres no urgency to solve kidney disease,"" Patel said. ""We will give out research prizes to fund innovative new approaches and aim to demystify FDA regulations which can be a deterrent to some investors.""

KidneyX, developed by the American Society of Nephrology and the HHS, will pilot a competition this year and will roll out other prize incentives for ideas to battle kidney disease over the next two years.

For David Rodriguez of San Antonio, Texas, the sense of community that the patients association meeting offers gives him peace of mind and encourages him to do more for others with the same disease. Diagnosed with kidney failure in 2008 at the age of 36, he said it was a wake up call.

""It was devastating,"" he said. ""The doctors told me my kidney was operating at just 15 percent. I remember thinking I had to call my family and prepare them that I could die.""

He spent nearly three years on dialysis before receiving an organ transplant in 2011. Rodriguez had to quit his job as a legal assistant during treatment. He lived off Social Security at that time and helped his father, who was also suffering from kidney failure. At the time, the wait list for a kidney in Texas was four to six years. Now its seven.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Seek medical attention, her Apple Watch said. Good thing she did.

In Florida, the average time for a transplant is 73 months, according to Tampa General Hospital, which leads the region in organ transplant surgeries. The average wait time there is 24.6 months.

""Its exhausting,"" said Rodriguez, now 46. ""Your life is so unpredictable when youre on dialysis and waiting for an organ.""

His father would eventually die from complications of kidney failure: ""Its easy to feel isolated because you dont want to put your burden on your family members all the time. This is why I wanted to become an advocate.""

Rodriguez now works as a patient relationship specialist at the University Transplant Center in San Antonio. Hes also on the associations board of directors and is the organizations ambassador for the state of Texas.

""This disease, it affects everyone,"" he said. ""Every culture has its own story.

""Managing this disease changes everything. It alters your life forever.""

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: State should allow smokable marijuana for patients,"When 71 percent of the voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing medical marijuana in Florida, nothing in that amendment said smoking marijuana shouldnt be allowed. Yet Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature refuse to allow access to smokable pot even though doctors recommend it for some patients. Now that a circuit court judge in Tallahassee has ruled the ban unconstitutional, the state should drop its appeal, respect the will of the voters and clear the way for patients to legally obtain smokable marijuana and get the relief they need.

Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers ruled last month that the 2017 state law that prohibits smoking marijuana is unconstitutional. The amendment passed by voters, she said, included all types of marijuana for medicinal use. Her sweeping order characterized the law as conflicting and overreaching and said it ""cannot be allowed to overrule the authority of the people to protect rights in the Constitution."" She doubled down this week by lifting an automatic stay on her ruling and gave the state until June 11 to make smokeable marijuana accessible at dispensaries throughout the state. That cant happen soon enough, but the stubborn state has appealed Gievers latest order to the First District Court of Appeal and asked that the stay remain in place until the core issue is settled.

The plaintiffs in the case  Diana Dodson of Levy County, who has HIV and neuropathy, and Cathy Jordan of Manatee County, who has ALS  break the law and smoke marijuana to get relief from their ailments. Theres simply no reason that their doctor-prescribed medical regimen should be a criminal matter. And there are countless other patients around the state like them, who may have trouble swallowing and cant use edible marijuana or dont get the same effect from oils or sprays. The constitutional amendment approved overwhelmingly by voters certainly does not exclude them.

The states argument against lifting the stay is both self-serving and circular. Attorneys argued that any patient who smokes marijuana would have acquired it illegally since the state hasnt set up a system for selling smokable marijuana. But that is only because lawmakers have violated the Constitution by banning it.

Also thanks to Gievers, that point might become moot. She ruled recently in a separate case that Tampas Joe Redner, who is recovering from lung cancer, can grow his own marijuana, which he uses in a raw form for juicing. That ruling applied exclusively to Redner but opened the gates to similar lawsuits from other patients.

Litigation was the predictable outcome of Floridas foray into medical marijuana, which required a special legislative session to implement. Since then the Department of Health has dragged its feet on setting up a framework for cultivating and distributing it even as thousands of patients register every week to be able to use it.

Floridians made clear their desire to have medical marijuana when they approved it in 2016 by a huge margin. By responding with a law that bans smoking, arguably the most common way the drug is used, lawmakers made clear their disdain for the peoples will. Now, by continuing to fight for the ban, the state is needlessly adding to the suffering of sick patients.",06/06/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Judge halts Florida ban on smoking medical marijuana,"In a second stinging blow to Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Legislature, a Leon County Circuit Court judge Tuesday lifted an automatic stay on her ruling that the state's ban on patient access to the smokable form of medical marijuana is unconstitutional.

Judge Karen Gievers gave the state until June 11 to put into action a process that will make smokable marijuana available to patients at marijuana dispensaries throughout the state. She ruled said that the state's attempt to delay the implementation of her May 25 ruling created irreparable harm to patients, particularly two women who challenged the law which prevents them from being prescribed smokable marijuana to treat their chronic diseases.

""First, they cannot legally access the treatment recommended for them,"" Gievers wrote in the four-page ruling. ""Second, they face potential criminal prosecution for possession and use of the medicinal substance.""

Diana Dodson of Levy County, who has HIV and neuropathy, and Cathy Jordan of Manatee County, who has Lou Gehrig's disease, testified in court Wednesday that although they qualify to receive the drug legally, they are alive only because they break the law and smoke it.

The Florida Department of Health, which is charged with regulating medical marijuana in the state, said it was reviewing the ruling and would not answer questions about whether it will move forward with rules related to smoking marijuana. Instead, the agency released a statement focused on the existing law, which Gievers has ruled was unconstitutionally inconsistent with voters' intent.

""The use of medical marijuana is outlined in state law, which was passed by an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority of the Florida legislature,"" said Devin Galetta, DOH spokesperson. ""Our focus remains with ensuring that patients have access to medical marijuana, and the Florida Department of Health has made significant progress in making this treatment available. In fact, there are more than 117,000 patients who have access to medical marijuana and over 1,300 doctors are licensed to order this treatment.""

Where is your compassion man?



“There is no likelihood of success by the defendants"" https://t.co/FWUUoo45Q1 — John Morgan (@JohnMorganESQ) June 5, 2018

Gievers first ruling was that the state law prohibiting patients who get a doctor's permission to be treated with medical marijuana from smoking was ""overreaching"" and violated the 2016 constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana for a wide range of ailments.

Scott and the Florida Department of Health appealed the ruling, prompting an automatic stay. The amendment's supporters, led by Orlando attorney John Morgan, then appealed the stay.

In a one-hour hearing in Leon County Circuit Court on Monday, attorneys for the state argued that Gievers should not lift the stay because smoking is not allowed in Florida because the legislature banned it. They said that if patients were allowed to smoke it they couldn't obtain it legally because the state hasn't set up rules to lawfully cultivate, distribute and sell smoke-able marijuana — and that process could take months.

""Nobody at this time can go to a medical marijuana treatment center and obtain smokable marijuana. … There is no lawful medical marijuana that can be smoked,"" said Karen Brodeen, senior assistant attorney general who argued for the state.

She also argued that the public will be confused because the state has not authorized the rules to regulate smokable marijuana.

Gievers said ""there is no evidence the defendants [the state] will suffer harm if the stay is vacated. Lifting the stay preserves the status quo by returning the law to its previous state as it existed following the 2016 adoption"" of the constitutional amendment.

She cautioned, however, that lifting the stay means that smoke-able marijuana is legal only for those who comply with the provisions of the amendment. They must have a qualifying debilitating disease, be registered as part of the patients registry and be under a doctor's care.

Florida voters approved Amendment 2 with 71 percent voting yes, but lawmakers limited its scope by directing patients who qualify to obtain medical marijuana to use only oils, sprays, tinctures, vaping and edibles. Lawmakers argued that smoking as a method for medical treatment would be a ""backdoor attempt"" at allowing recreational use.

But two patients who treat their debilitating diseases with marijuana — one with ALS and the other with HIV — testified in the one-day trial before Gievers that smoking is the only form that works for them.

Jordan, 68, who has ALS, testified that to treat her disease she breaks the law and grows the plants in her backyard.

""In '86, I was given three to five years to live and I'm still here,"" she said, adding that smoking is the only form her system can tolerate. ""It just makes my life a lot more bearable.""

Morgan blasted the governor in a series of Tweets and urged him to drop the appeal.

""#SlickRick please follow the law & the will of 72% of the people,"" Morgan wrote on Twitter Tuesday. ""Everyday you waste taxpayers' money w/ this frivolous appeal sick people, veterans, cops, firefighters & cancer patients suffer!

""Where is your compassion man?

""There is no likelihood of success by the defendants.""

In a series of Tweets over the last two days, Morgan said that the governor's attempts to go against the majority of voters ""will be a stain on @ScottforFlorida forever.""

Tampa Bay Times,Florida judge considers lifting stay on smokable marijuana,"Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers said Monday she will decide quickly on whether to lift an automatic stay on her ruling declaring that the state's ban on smoking medical marijuana is unconstitutional.

If she lifts the ban, it will force Gov. Rick Scott and state regulators to move forward on rules they have spent the last two years trying to delay.

But, even ""though the department hasn't done what it was supposed to within six months of what the voters ordered,"" Gievers suggested she might delay her stay for a limited amount of time to give the Department of Health time to start the process to authorize smoking as a legal form of medical marijuana consumption.

Gievers ruled on May 25 that a state law that prohibited patients who get a doctor's permission to be treated with medical marijuana from smoking was ""overreaching"" and violated the 2016 constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana for a wide range of ailments.

Scott and the Florida Department of Health appealed the ruling, prompting an automatic stay. The amendment's supporters, led by Orlando attorney John Morgan, then appealed the stay.

In a one-hour hearing in Leon County Circuit Court, attorneys for the state argued that Gievers should not lift the stay because smoking is not allowed in Florida because the legislature banned it. They said that if patients were allowed to smoke it they couldn't obtain it legally because the state hasn't set up rules to lawfully cultivate, distribute and sell smoke-able marijuana — and that process could take months.

""Nobody at this time can go to a medical marijuana treatment center and obtain smoke-able marijuana…There is no lawful medical marijuana that can be smoked,"" said Karen Brodeen, senior assistant attorney general who argued for the state.

She urged Gievers not to lift the stay, arguing that the public will be confused because the state has not authorized the rules to regulate smoke-able marijuana.

""They will subjectively say, 'Now I can smoke marijuana because I have one of these triggering conditions,' even thought they never went to a doctor,"" she said.

But Jon Mills, attorney for the marijuana advocates who filed the lawsuit against the state last July, dismissed the state's claim. Just because the state now illegally prohibits patients from asking doctors for permission to treat themselves through smoking medical marijuana doesn't mean the state should be allowed to continue to do it, he said.

""That could be seen as blowing smoke,"" he said, after the hearing. ""You have to have a certification. You have to have a doctor prescribe it and today's order would put the process in motion to allow that to happen.""

Florida voters approved Amendment 2 with 71 percent voting yes, but lawmakers limited its scope by directing patients who qualify to obtain medical marijuana to use only oils, sprays, tinctures, vaping and edibles.

Lawmakers argued that smoking as a method for medical treatment would be a ""backdoor attempt"" at allowing recreational use.

But two patients who treat their debilitating diseases with marijuana — one with ALS and the other with HIV — testified in the one-day trial before Gievers that smoking is the only form that works for them.

Cathy Jordan, 68, who has ALS, testified that to treat her disease she breaks the law and grows the plants in her backyard.

""In '86, I was given three to five years to live and I'm still here,"" she said, adding that smoking is the only form her system can tolerate. ""It just makes my life a lot more bearable.""

Mills argued that delaying the ruling while the state appeals it would do irreparable harm to them and other patients. He submitted documents that show that there are 1,450 ALS cases in Florida, according to the National Institutes of Health; 10,000 new cases of cancer each year and there have been 17,000 deaths in Florida due to Parkinson's disease — all ailments that can be treated with medical marijuana.

Morgan, who financed the lawsuit and much of the amendment campaign, urged Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi to drop the appeal. He said that, depending on the First District Court of Appeal's response to the state's appeal, he will seek to expedite it to the state Supreme Court to force a resolution more quickly.",04/06/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Battle rages between Rick Scott, John Morgan over smokable medical marijuana","Trial lawyer John Morgan is urging Gov. Rick Scott on Twitter to ""put the politics aside"" and drop the state's appeal of a court decision that legalized smokable medical marijuana in Florida.

Morgan, who won the case in state court and who was a major backer of Amendment 2 that legalized medical pot in Florida in 2016, had already urged his nearly 62,000 twitter followers to call Scott's office and urge him to drop the appeal. Morgan, a Democrat, sides with Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, Scott's opponent, who said Friday he supports letting patients with cancer, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS and other conditions smoke medical marijuana in private.

Now for a few questions for @FLGovScott...



Did you vote NO and now have found a way to thwart the WILL of the people and DENY sick and dying people and brave veterans?



Did you read the intent language before you voted?@ScottforFlorida what was your vote on 2? pic.twitter.com/U3iM9pIMzY — John Morgan (@JohnMorganESQ) June 1, 2018

Scott, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, appeared on an Orlando TV station and defended the state's decision to appeal.

""This is not about politics. This is about following the law,"" Scott said on Fox 35 in Orlando. ""We've got to follow what the law is.""

Circuit Judge Karen Gievers in Tallahassee, in a decision last week, agreed with constitutional law expert Jon Mills that Amendment 2, which was approved by 71 percent of voters, included a definition of ""all types of medical marijuana.""

The state immediately filed an appeal, which effectively blocked the implementation of Gievers' ruling.

In a six-minute Twitter video, Morgan accuses Scott of doing the bidding of Mel Sembler, a wealthy St. Petersburg Republican donor and Scott supporter who opposed legalizing medical marijuana.

""Believe me, Rick, Mel Sembler is going to vote for you and give you money no matter what,"" Morgan says.

More than 6.5 million Florida voters cast ballots in favor of the amendment in the 2016 election. By comparison, President Donald Trump got 4.6 million votes in Florida.

Speaking directly to Scott, Morgan says in his video: ""You control the state of Florida. You have the power to tell the state of Florida and your lawyers, 'Drop this appeal' … It is wrong morally and it is wrong politically.""

Tampa Bay Times,Florida scientists are working to solve greening. They were too late for Cee Bee’s.,"ODESSA - The trees were so heavy with oranges that their limbs stooped to the ground, the scent of their blossoms distracting drivers who rolled their windows down. Their branches were so thick with leaves and clumped with fruit that deer would tangle their antlers in them. Adam Burchenal couldn’t say no 11 years ago when his grandfather offered him a job here, at Cee Bee’s Citrus Emporium.

In the beginning, he was the manager of the juice room. When Adam reported for work in the mornings, the sunlight was golden on the orange rinds. Some 15,000 trees painted long shadows on the 300 acres of farmland where Hillsborough County bumps up against Pinellas and Pasco.

He spent his days watching the oranges blur into a pulpy slush, scraping the dregs at the machine’s bottom into the best Popsicles he had ever tasted. Before a date, Adam would pick out a shirt and pants and leave them for hours in the juice room, his secret cologne.

But that was a long time ago, and now the juice Adam mixes with ice and protein powder and calls breakfast comes from another farm. The juice room has been shut down for years, ever since the trees thinned out and his grandfather realized they were losing money on every bottle sold.

Now Adam took a sip as he stood outside the family business on Boy Scout Road. The morning was darker and cooler than usual, an hour lost to Daylight Savings just the week before. He put his knee in the dirt, trying to tie up a banner that the wind kept flapping down:

STORE CLOSING

EVERYTHING MUST GO

Adam, 31, dusted off his hands and climbed into his truck. He needed to pick oranges. The Valencias ripen late; some were still dotting the trees. He had taken the Cee Bee’s website down, but two orders snuck in before it went dark. A reason to keep going, even if for just a while longer.

It is no secret that a disease known as citrus greening has devastated the Florida orange industry, and that a cure evades top scientists, who, even as you read this, are sealing petri dishes with cellophane and prayer.

Science is close to -- if not a solution -- a variety of work-arounds that allow orange trees infected with greening to live for years. Some experiments are bearing especially exciting results, trees lush with leaves and oranges, ready for sale.

But thousands of growers have already called it quits. Thousands more are living season-to-season with one eye on Lake Alfred, a small town east of Lakeland that’s become ground-zero for citrus greening experiments.

And Tampa Bay is about to lose its last true commercial orange grove.

In Adam’s mind, the downfall is an out-of-order montage. He doesn’t remember when they started growing lettuce, tomatoes, even pomegranates and kale to try to turn a profit. He’s not sure which year they began Frankenstein-like experiments in the groves, praying for oranges that looked, well -- orange.

It was the end of the season, and the disease hadn’t left much. He drove past a mass grave of trees, long-dead and piled high.

Adam kept driving until he spotted a tree still bundled in leaves. He stood on his toes as he reached for the fruit, hanging on the canopy, almost out of his grasp.

We put it on our license plates, serve its juice at our visitor centers, smack “Fresh from Florida” on every carton we can; send our kids to Orange Grove Middle School, build houses in Citrus Park and sign leases in Citrus Village (a preferred apartment community!). We throw down at the Orange Bowl. Fight over where to put Tropicana Field.

Yet Florida is slated to produce only 45 million boxes of oranges this year. That’s one-quarter of what it was 10 years ago. It’s the lowest production since World War II. California now sells more oranges. Brazil sells more juice.

But those are not the numbers that keep Mike Sparks awake at night. The chief executive of Florida Citrus Mutual, the state’s largest organization of growers, Sparks knows that the true question isn’t whether we’ll solve greening.

It’s whether they’ll be anyone left to grow oranges when we do.

There were 76,000 jobs in the citrus industry -- everyone from the pickers in the field and the flat-bed truck drivers to the packing-house barons and their receptionists -- when Adam came to Cee Bee’s a decade ago. Now there are 31,000 jobs, a 59 percent drop.

Growers -- people like Adam and his grandfather -- have disappeared at a similar rate. Where there were once 8,000 in Florida, there are now 3,800.

“We’re getting down to a make-it-or-break-it for the Florida citrus industry,” says Sparks, who was part of the Florida Department of Citrus team that put the orange on the license plate decades ago. He remembers celebrating, the high-fiving, the champagne. “Mobile billboards,” they called the plates.

And now.

A quarter of Florida’s citrus acreage is gone. Twenty-five processing plants have become 12, and they’re not operating at capacity. The state has lost $2 billion in economic impact, and it would have lost so much more, except the price of oranges and juice have gone up for the consumer.

Initial reports for this season showed promise that for the first time in five years, orange production would go up. Scientists cheered: Their research was paying off. Then Hurricane Irma knocked all that fruit off the trees.

“You have to be honest with the growers, you know: you’ve gone through the 10 most difficult years in Florida citrus, and there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and the industry will make it, but will they be a part of this future?” Sparks says. “Many of these growers are fourth- or fifth-generation with a sixth on the way. If you take the risk, if we win the fight against [greening], if we can keep all the infrastructure and processors going, it’s going to be financially rewarding.

“But that’s a lot of ifs.”

Florida Citrus Mutual used to call downtown Lakeland its headquarters, with a building that took up an entire city block on E. Orange Street.

About a year and a half ago, it sold its headquarters to Publix. Sparks now has a small office in a BB&T building in Bartow.

“We right-sized.”

When Adam’s grandfather bought Cee Bee’s in the 1990s, it was much smaller and in a sorry state. The citrus trees were strangled by vines and crowded by overgrown oaks. The soil was starving. Heirloom trees wilted, listening for last rites.

Newsart graphic:

The best land to grow oranges used to be in north and central Florida. The colder temperatures in the winters made the juice sweeter. But crop-killing freezes drove most growers south. Tampa Bay planted housing developments in their wake.

William Burchenal Jr., who was in his 60s and went by Bill, wasn’t the obvious buyer for this neglected grove. Once an electrical engineer for the Air Force during the Korean War, he made a small fortune in advertising and real estate.

He had never grown citrus, but he’d admired it as a student at Eckerd College and the University of South Florida. And he had lived an adventurous life, traveling to five continents, sailboat racing to Cuba and playing the jazz drum. He did not plan to slow down now.

Bill Burchenal went into the orange business in the 1990s. Here, he helps load a shipment for delivery to Eckerd College. [Times file]

So he got down on his hands and knees and turned the grove around, enlisting the help of Les Dennison and his family. The Dennisons had been growing Florida citrus for 100 years, even cultivating this grove when it was first planted in the 1920s. In just a few seasons, the fruit came in. And the grove grew, parcel by parcel.

In the early days, it was just Bill and Les, picking oranges in the mornings, cleaning and sorting in the afternoon. At the end of the day, they’d drive their haul out to restaurants, colleges and hotels.

Cee Bee’s soon supplied all the citrus for Pasco and Hillsborough public schools, and fresh-squeezed orange juice for Eckerd. The staff grew to 19. In 2002, Cee Bee’s came online. It started marketing oranges as a delicacy to down-wrapped northerners, until this was the bulk of its business.

Sometimes, Bill and his staff would get calls. “You sent me some green fruit,” the customers said. But this was before this disease - huanglongbing, or HLB, as it was known by scientists - and Bill would patiently explain that they did not gas and dye their fruit like the oranges at the grocery store. There was nothing to worry about.

They survived canker, cold weather and the fitness generation’s realization that there are calories in orange juice. Bill fixed up a small house on the land, yards from a lake they shared with the Winn-Dixie family. He and his wife would sit on a bench swing and look out at the water after a long day’s work. Deer and turkeys darted through the trees, even panthers once in a while.

Bill Burchenal asked his grandson, Adam, to join the family business, and he hoped they'd be able to keep it going. [Times file]

One day, Bill put his arm around Adam’s shoulders. They were on a family vacation to Italy, walking the canals of Venice.

Here he asked his grandson to join him at Cee Bee’s. Adam was born in Tampa, but had moved to Austin as a child while his father got his doctorate at the University of Texas. Adam had stayed there, earning a business degree at a small college in Austin and managing a bagel shop.

Now he saw an opportunity to be closer to his grandfather and escape a franchise for a family business.

It was 2007. Some of the trees at Cee Bee’s, like at most other orange farms, were starting to show symptoms. The leaves were a little smaller. Some of the fruit felt hard and fell off the tree too soon.

Bill Burchenal was worried. He was. But he had already saved the place so many times, and he reckoned he might be able to do it again, this time with his grandson.

He just didn’t realize what they were up against.

Upon re-entering the country after travel abroad, Americans are required to fill out a blue and white U.S. customs form, typically distributed in flight. While it is usually a coming to Jesus about how much was truly spent on souvenirs, there is a key question:

I am (We are) bringing

(a) fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, food, insects: Yes or no?

How did greening, once the distant scourge of China, India and South Africa, make its way to Florida to destroy a signature crop and a way of life? Could it be because someone checked “no” when he should have checked “yes”?

This is something Michael Rogers, director of the Citrus Research and Education Center at the University of Florida, thinks about often. One day in 2005, he was sitting in a conference room, meeting with citrus processors, when his phone buzzed. He had a text:

“It is here.”

In that moment, it felt as though a bomb had gone off, Rogers says now, the shock coming in waves. He and his colleagues had seen what greening had done to citrus around the world. The enemy had been lurking abroad for more than a century.

Citrus greening is a disease carried by the Diaphorina citri, a sap-sucking insect that’s of little threat on its own. Commonly called the Asian citrus psyllid, the brown-mottled bug tested negative for the disease when it was first found in Florida in 1998. Rogers believes the infection traveled separately, smuggled in a carry-on bag.

The thing to understand is that, when it comes to growing oranges, there’s no such thing as an “orange tree.” Each variety -- Valencias, navels, tangerines -- is a forced marriage, often from two wildly different plants.

The rootstock, usually a stump with a healthy root system, is wed to a scion, typically a bud or a shoot. For instance: oranges sometimes sprout from roots designed by nature for lemons.

Orange growers love these unconventional unions because they can make a tree more resistant to cold weather; and, like a cook tinkering with a family recipe, growers take pride in creating their own breed of perfection.

All it took, then, was a one-inch piece of green wood -- a twig -- and a grower who wanted to bring his own variety stateside, to bring down the Florida orange. “I’ve heard people get caught at customs with it in their socks and underwear,” Rogers says.

Once the disease was here, it was everywhere. Greening is so contagious that when one tree gets it, they all do. It took a few years for the symptoms to fully appear, years of dismissing problems as an off season or bad nutrition.

Then suddenly it was undeniable: the small leaves, streaked pale green or blotched yellow. The limbs so bare that you could see through each tree to the next one, skinny with the same sickness. The fruit came in too small, too hard. It fell to the ground too early. It shaded green. It tasted bitter.

More than one scientist has likened citrus greening’s effect on Florida’s orange trees to what AIDS did to a generation of humans in the 1980s, and it’s not hard to see why. The disease makes it impossible for the tree to stay healthy. The roots shrink and swell, unable to move water or nutrients up to the canopy. Think about trying to suck a blueberry through a straw. Without water, the tree can’t hold the oranges up.

At the same time, the leaves are converting sunlight into carbohydrates and sugar: photosynthesis 101. But with greening, they aren’t able to get the sugar into the tree’s circulatory system. It gets stuck in the leaves, becomes starch and messes up, well, everything.

At least 80 percent, and maybe more than 90 percent, of Florida’s citrus acreage is infected with greening. Once a tree is infected, there is no cure. You can rip it all up and start over; but unless the neighboring grove follows suit, and the one next to that, and that, and that --

It’s just going to come back.

***

The best fruit is toward the center of the tree. Adam almost disappeared inside of it, moving through the leaves with the instinctive ease of an animal. His Cee Bee’s hat was on backward, his sunglasses pushed up over his forehead. Adam can’t pick oranges with them on anymore; the tint disguised the green rinds as healthy.

He headed back to the store, the Valencias heavy in his picker’s bag.

Adam’s grandfather didn’t share the numbers, but it was obvious they were losing money. After greening came, Adam doesn’t think there was a year in the black. They used to send out “trailer-loads upon trailer-loads of citrus” a season, maybe 35, Adam remembers. “Now we’d be lucky to get five.”

The concessions were many. They built a greenhouse for tomatoes and lettuce. They planted pomegranate and peach trees and bushes of blueberries, farmed kale, broccoli and turnips.

It took five years for Adam to persuade his grandfather to put in an ice cream machine, and they sold novelty orange cones for a few dollars apiece. They tried cutting down on herbicide and fertilizer. They turned off one of the two fans in the juice room. Then they started laying off staff. That was the hardest part.

Adam and his grandfather began talking with UF’s citrus scientists, as well as a few at USF. Researchers had ideas about experimental rootstocks and fertilizer regimens. Those efforts would allow trees to survive years longer and produce fruit as sweet and orange as they had ever been, as an HIV-infected person can now live for decades. The Burchenals said yes. They had nothing to lose.

Les’ son, Mike Dennison, had become the grove manager after his father passed away. He helped plant new rootstocks and tried different fertilizers and spray programs.

Mike tested something called Aqua-Yield, which makes the nutrients so tiny that they can slip through the shrunken roots.

Farming is a game of patience. New trees take years to grow, to bear viable fruit. Sick trees need time to get better.

Bill had high blood pressure and a tricky heart. A cold would put him out for six weeks. As his health faded in late 2016, he told his grandson, “If there is any way to keep it going, keep it going.” But: “Do what you’ve got to do.” He passed away three days after Christmas.

“One of his real regrets, one of his great disappointments,” said Adam’s father, Ken, “is he wasn’t able to see it get to be sustainable, to be able to survive greening.”

Ken moved back from Austin to help on the farm and look after his mother. That’s when Adam and his father first saw the numbers. Cee Bee’s was losing an astonishing amount of money, and had been for years. “Dad was able to swallow the bottom line,” Ken said. “The rest of the family didn’t have the resources to cover it.”

Adam and his father realized this would be their last season.

The fruit started coming in November. “Ironically,” Ken said, “this has been the best year in a long time.”

Early one morning on the last day of March, Jude Grosser, a plant genetics professor and citrus researcher, walked through the groves of UF’s Lake Alfred campus. Just 15 miles from Lakeland, its the staging site of the country’s best guesses to crush greening.

On one stretch of land, they grow orange trees under screens to keep out the Asian psyllid. In another grove, they’ve tied ribbons -- blue, pink, green, striped -- in a real-life paternity test of which variety has been bred with which.

Before greening came, Grosser was trying to develop oranges better-suited for not-for-concentrate juice. Now, he has been breeding sugarbells, a cross between a clementine and a honeybell. They have survived 14-degree winters, and he and his colleagues found that varieties tolerant of harsh environments do the best against greening.

“Our work is often like this: If after four years, two of these trees don’t have greening, why is that?” he said. “Are they the last two to get infected? Or are they different somehow?”

Fred Gmitter, a professor of horticultural sciences at the University of Florida, identifies a leaf affected by its small size and light color. [GABRIELLA ANGOTTI-JONES | Times]

Climbing into his truck, Grosser eases through rows of cybrids: oranges whose nuclei have been replaced with that of another species, like a grapefruit. Out the window grows Cybrid 304, a big tangerine that’s easy to peel and crosses well with other oranges. They’ve grown so full that their branches scrape against the truck’s side as Grosser moves through them. “They’re all infected,” he said. “But they don’t care.”

This is the difference between immunity and tolerance. The UF team, the premier citrus researchers in the country, want to find a tree that’s immune to greening. But they also recognize that cure could be decades off. In the meantime, they’re chasing trees that are tolerant, growing vibrantly despite infection.

“That might be the best we’re ever going to get,” said Fred Gmitter, a citrus breeding and genetics researcher who works alongside Grosser.

Part of what these scientists are trying to do is figure out why some varieties succeed while others don’t. They know, for instance, that oranges with seeds are more devastated than those without. In the beginning, honey murcotts didn’t stand a chance.

They’ve identified promising rootstocks that don’t lose their feeder roots like most trees do when first infected. But ask them why they are so successful. “We have no idea,” Grosser says.

There are 2,000 genes that they can play up or down and see whether the tree fares better. But which gene is the right target? Are there five targets? “It’s like picking through that haystack and finding needles,” Gmitter says, “but finding the right needles.”

They know that replacing the orange’s NPR-1 gene, which affects the immune system, with the same gene from a mustard plant works wonders. A Hamlin orange tree with the swapped-out gene is tolerant going on year six.

That’s good news — great, even — except that it has historically taken scientists up to 20 years to determine if a tree is ready for commercial release. But given the urgency of greening, given the decimation, UF has been doing things differently. It is recruiting growers as researchers. Beginning in the fall, and running through spring, UF hosts five displays of any trees in its pipeline that look promising.

Growers are invited to come through and evaluate the sample trees, ranking the varieties they’d most like to try in the field. Then they’re given a clipping of the tree, and asked to send feedback.

Pete Spyke, a third-generation citrus grower and long-time citrus consultant, owns the roadside Orange Shop in Citra, 15 miles north of Ocala. The porch here is bundled with bushels of large, lovely fruit, almost technicolor in their orange hue.

Spyke says greening is not a problem for him anymore.

He was one of the first large growers to get involved with the fight against greening, traveling to China and South Africa on expeditions with scientists and other growers.

Spyke grew 30 different varieties, flooding them with fertilizer and water. He found the ones that worked: navel, Valencia, temple, page, nova, Minneola. He replanted more than once, bankrolled by the luxuries of money and time. And he doesn’t seem to be going anywhere.

The Orange Shop is still frequented by tourists who stop on the way south along U.S. 301 or grab some oranges to take home. [GABRIELLA ANGOTTI-JONES | Times]

It’s the smaller growers who haven’t been able to hold on.

“They put their heart and soul into it,” says Sparks, the head of the growers’ group.

“It’s just hard to accept that, you know. That not everyone is going to be a part of the Florida orange’s future.”

The last one in Hillsborough tried to be, up until the end.

Adam Burchenal sorts through his morning's pick of valencias, weeding out those damaged by greening. [GABRIELLA ANGOTTI-JONES | Times]

Back at the store, Adam shook out his bag of oranges. They tumbled onto a conveyor belt, slowly rolling toward a dripping wall, layering them with a light sweater of soap.

The fruit came out the other side spinning, knocking into each other as they headed for an air dryer. The excess water became puddles below the machine, now emitting heat and a motor roar. The Valencias appeared to glisten now, some like the technicolor dream at Spyke’s shop.

Adam stood at one end of the machine, inspecting the oranges before their next spin. He picked one up, inspected it for a moment. Then wound up his arm and threw it over his shoulder. He picked up another, and he threw that one away, too. He didn’t look to see it land at the base of a tree, surrounded by other fruit that had missed the mark, that he had thought were healthy when he picked them but, in the end, were green.

How sad it is to be an orange that isn’t orange.

The survivors were packaged and sent to Nashville, Tenn., and Augusta, Maine.

“I’m gonna miss this gig,” a customer, Scott Archibald, was heard saying loudly from the adjoining store. He picked through tomatoes.

“Man, me, too,” said the receptionist. Some of their customers had been oblivious to greening. The out-of-towners seemed the most in the loop.

“I’ll keep coming till the door’s locked,” said Scott. The door swung shut behind him.

Adam was not sure what would come next, for him or for the land. The best-case-scenario was to sell to someone who wanted to make a go at oranges. But who would be crazy enough to do that, he wondered. Maybe the beekeepers who leased some land for their honey would want it. Or someone else who would keep this place rural, when so little else in the area still was.

Adam walked into the little office building he shared with his dad and the few remaining staff. His grandfather’s obituary was pinned to the bulletin board behind his desk. The two of them were so similar, he said: Both shaped like blocks, both hard of hearing, the same-sounding whistle. He tried to imagine what it would be like to see all of his grandfather’s trees ripped out of the ground. The thought was crushing, he said. Even worse than the disease.

Closing wouldn’t be a big, grand thing, Adam said. They would lock up the store at the end of the season, probably June 2. They would hold a goodbye-barbecue for their customers. Sell what they could of the equipment at an auction. Meet with buyers, until it was done.

And there was one more thing.

Deep in the farm sits that pile of dead trees so high and long that it takes several minutes to walk around it and a craned neck to see the top properly. These are the skeletons of all kinds of orange trees, most of them killed by greening. There is not a leaf on the bone-like branches, only weeds poking through them; no life except for the ants belly-crawling from soft hills.

Sometime during the rainy season, Adam and his crew will paint the pile with diesel fuel, and throw a match on top. They will burn it all down, back to the soil. The bonfire will take all afternoon. And there in the flames, for one last time, the trees will be orange.

Tampa Bay Times,The staff of Delta flight 1827 asked if there was a doctor on board. They got the nation’s doctor.’,"When the flight staff of Delta flight 1827 needed a doctor, they got one: The ""nations doctor.""

On Wednesday Jerome Adams, the U.S. surgeon general, tweeted that Delta staff on his flight to Jackson, Mississippi, asked if there was a doctor on board to assist in a medical emergency.

On my @Delta flight to Jackson, Mississippi (by way of Atlanta), and they asked if there was a Doctor on board to help with a medical emergency- why yes- yes there was.

Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said in an email statement that ""Prior to takeoff, Delta flight 1827 from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta returned to the gate following a customer illness. Medical assistance was provided by the U.S. Surgeon General who worked with our flight crew to aid the customer.""

The condition of the passenger was not immediately clear, though Adams tweeted ""patient doing well."" Neither the doctor nor the airline revealed what the passengers medical issue was.

The department of Health and Human services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An anesthesiologist, Adams was previously Indianas health commissioner, and in recent years is best known for his response to an HIV outbreak that left 181 people infected in a rural Indiana county. He had also worked to tamp down panic in the United States over the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Bernstein reported.

According to the Jackson, Mississippi, Clarion Ledger, Adams was headed to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson to discuss the opioid epidemic with a panel of experts and Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who praised the doctor for his good deed.",17/05/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Why can’t patients smoke marijuana in Florida? John Morgan pushes for answers today in court.,"In dramatic testimony, two patients who treat their debilitating diseases with marijuana testified in court Wednesday that although they qualify to receive the drug legally, they are alive only because they break the law and smoke it.

Diana Dodson of Levy County, who has HIV and neuropathy, and Cathy Jordan of Manatee County, who has Lou Gehrig's disease, urged Leon County Circuit Court Judge Karen Gievers to overturn the state's ban on smoking medical marijuana, arguing that the forms the state allows doesn't go them any good.

""In '86, I was given three to five years to live and I'm still here,"" said Jordan, 68, seated in a wheelchair in the front of the court, her voice scratchy and weak from her ailment.

She testified that to treat her disease, she breaks the law and grows the plants in her backyard. She said that she ""can't do edibles"" — a form of medical marijuana that is allowed in Florida — because they ""cause terrible, terrible muscle pain in my stomach"" and vaping, the alternative to smoking, makes her gag. Smoking, however, increases her appetite, dries her excess saliva, and calms her muscles, she said. ""It just makes my life a lot more bearable.""

Jordan, who has been on a crusade to legalize medical marijuana since she was diagnosed with her disease 31 years ago, said her doctors are not concerned about the risks associated with smoking ""because I'm still alive.""

Gievers asked Jordan if she would obtain marijuana legally if smoking wasn't banned by law. ""That's why I joined this case,"" Jordan replied.

The lawsuit against the state was brought last July by Orlando attorney John Morgan, who spearheaded and financed the successful campaign to make medical access to cannabis a constitutional right.

He filed suit on behalf of the patients and two advocacy organizations asking the court to invalidate the law passed by the Florida Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Scott to implement the amendment because it violates the intent of the constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2016.

The trial Wednesday lasted three hours and ended with Gievers promising a swift ruling because of what she considered the ""time urgency"" of the case. She also said she expects her decision is likely to be appealed.

Florida voters approved Amendment 2 authorizing the use of marijuana as a medical treatment for people with debilitating medical conditions, with 71 percent voting yes. But lawmakers limited its scope by directing patients who qualify to obtain medical marijuana to use only oils, sprays, tinctures, vaping and edibles.

Lawmakers excluded smoking as a method for medical treatment, arguing that smoking would be a ""backdoor attempt"" at allowing recreational use.

Morgan, who calls Jordan ""a Florida hero"" for her relentless crusade argued that banning smoking as a method of using medical marijuana amounted to trampling on the intentions of voters who voted for the constitutional amendment.

""Today we saw a woman, literally fighting for her life, hoping to be able to smoke marijuana to be able to dry up her saliva so she doesn't choke and die on her own spit,"" Morgan said after the trial ended. ""The State of Florida, who is here to protect our lives, is in fact trying to take her life — and so many like her, and so many who will be like her.""

He financed the campaign to make medical marijuana a constitutional right and is backing the lawsuit. [MARY ELLEN KLAS | Tampa Bay Times}

Jon Mills, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the definition voters approved included ""all types of medical marijuana, including flowers, which is smokeable marijuana.

""The Constitution of the State of Florida promised the ability of people with debilitating conditions to seek treatment through medical marijuana, including smokeable medical marijuana,"" he said. ""If the state is able to prohibit smokeable marijuana, why shouldn't they be able to prohibit vaping? Why shouldn't they be able to prohibit edibles? Why shouldn't they be able to prohibit medical marijuana?""

Rachel Nordby, the lawyer for the state, argued that the implementing law is ""entirely consistent"" with the Constitution because the state ""has a role in setting parameters and it can absolutely base those parameters on health and safety concerns.""

""The Legislature here has enacted a law that embodies reasonable safety concerns of medical use,"" she said, adding that it ""contemplated that it was making the flower form available through vaping.""

""This case is not about what is or what is not marijuana,"" she said. ""What this case is about is the permissible plain uses of marijuana.""

""Here, there are no material facts in dispute,"" she said, adding that plaintiffs lacked standing in the case because the members of the advocacy group People United for Medical Marijuana did not authorize the lawsuit and Dodson had not obtained a doctor's permission to use marijuana.

Morgan, whose younger brother was paralyzed at as teenage lifeguard after a diving accident, believes that smoking ""is a medically effective and efficient way"" to administer the active chemicals in cannabis for patients. He poured more than $4 million into the campaign to pass the amendment and is now bankrolling the lawsuit.

Dodson told the court that she used medical marijuana in California after she couldn't keep other medications down for her symptoms. She said she has used all forms of cannabis, including oils and vaping.

""Smoked cannabis works best for me,"" she testified. ""It's easier to get the amount that I need and i don't get too much in my system.""

She said that vaping is ""about 50 percent less effective and you had to ingest quite a bit more."" Depending on the preparation, oils are less easy to control, she said.

Jordan said doctors have told her that her lungs are at 78 percent, ""which is unheard of for ALS patient"" and she credits it to smoking marijuana for 30 years.

She said she suggested once to her doctors that she quit for three to four days to see what happened and they told her not to because it might bring on problems that could not be reversed.

Morgan, who uses the hashtag #NoSmokeIsAJoke, argues that the legislative claim has been a ""bogus argument from Day 1,"" and that if legislators were truly interested in keeping the public safe from smoking, they would have taxed tobacco ""to the hilt.""

Ben Pollara, treasurer for People United for Medical Marijuana who managed the successful campaign to pass the amendment, testified that the amendment contemplated that it would allow patients to smoke marijuana.

""I don't think we considered anything otherwise,"" he said.

The Department of Health's Office of Medical Marijuana Use, which is tasked with enforcing and overseeing the law's implementation, has been dogged by delays in getting the measure working for patients.

Among the problems have been a backlog in identification cards for patients and slowdowns in approving dispensing licenses and promulgating various regulations. The office has also struggled to roll out guidelines on a variety of issues related to the new law, including edibles.

The office's head, Christian Bax, has blamed the delays in part on lawsuits and administrative challenges, although the office also failed to respond to questions from a joint committee of lawmakers for months.

The silence frustrated lawmakers during the legislative session so much that they voted in the upcoming year's budget to hold back $1.9 million in salaries and benefits to pressure it to move faster on implementing parts of the law.

If Morgan's lawsuit prevails, the state Department of Health would be tasked with writing rules regarding the new directive.

Tampa Bay Times,Column: Why baby steps toward cheaper drugs are the best we can do,"On the stump, Donald Trump the candidate promised big changes in the way America buys prescription drugs  allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and allowing Americans to buy at the prices that Canada has negotiated by importing drugs from abroad. Now Trump the president has finally unveiled his big drug plan, and there is some confusion out there as to whether he has delivered on his promise.

On Hugh Hewitts radio show, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar delivered a lengthy retort to claims that the administration had punted on drug price negotiation: ""What we are doing is more sweeping than anybodys ever proposed before. We are enhancing the powers of the retail prescription drug program, whats called Part D. We are unshackling these middlemen, these Part D plans, that negotiate on our behalf.""

A friend emailed Monday morning to ask what the truth was. And in case hes not the only person confused, it seems worth explaining what Azar is saying.

In typical American fashion, when Medicare added prescription drug coverage, we didnt do anything simple, like having the government buy a bunch of drugs and dispense them, or simply offering to reimburse drug purchases. Instead, Medicare Part D operates through private plans, each of which has its own set of drugs that its willing to cover.

Those private plans can and do negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to get discounts on those drugs. However, their ability to negotiate is limited, because Medicare requires that every plan offer at least two treatments for a given condition  and basically every available treatment for the ""six protected classes,"" which include conditions such as HIV and cancer.

Its a bit hard for drug plans to negotiate under such conditions. If manufacturers know that you are basically going to have to buy their product no matter what they charge, is it any wonder that some cancer drugs run well into the six figures?

So the administration is giving drug plans some leverage: Its proposing to drop the number of covered drugs down to one in some categories. The proposal also contains some language about letting Part D plans negotiate prices for drugs in the ""six protected classes,"" though its not clear exactly what this means. Its reasonable to believe that this will lower the prices of the drugs for some conditions, though its also reasonable to believe that this will make it harder for some seniors to get their preferred drugs.

So Azar is right that Trumps proposal means more negotiation for Medicare drug prices. And his critics are right that this is not at all what they meant by ""let Medicare negotiate drug prices."" What they meant was that they wanted the Department of Health and Human Services to engage in global drug price negotiations for the whole program, and thereby get fabulous discounts through the power of bulk purchasing.

Unfortunately, this isnt the end of the discussion, because most of the people saying ""unleash the negotiators"" are confused. By itself, covering a lot of patients doesnt give you all that much negotiating power; if it did, wed already be enjoying some of the cheapest drug prices in the world. Americas biggest pharmaceutical benefit managers cover more people than the entire populations of many European countries. Yet those countries get much lower prices on many drugs than we do.

How, then, do they get those savings? Through the healing magic of the word ""no."" Regulators elsewhere, unlike here, have some freedom to say, ""Nope, your drug is simply too expensive for the benefit it delivers.""

This gives them a lot of leverage in negotiations, but it involves a certain amount of steely will, because in order to make it work, you have to occasionally actually refuse to cover a pricey drug, then weather the resulting public outcry from very sick patients who are desperate to have any treatment, whatever the cost.

The astute reader will by now have noticed that what Trump is proposing is actually a step toward what people wanted the government to do when they said ""let Medicare negotiate drug prices""  even though its not very much at all like what they imagined would happen when Medicare negotiated. This astute reader will also have noticed, however, that its at best only a half-step. Drug plans will still have only limited ability to say ""Sorry about your cancer, but were just not paying $300,000 to buy you another few months of life.""

Its not really surprising that theyre only willing to take a half-step. Most American health-care reform proposals look a lot like this one: Emulate some practice thats common in other countries, only weaken it so that its not nearly as effective as what those countries do. You may be surprised to learn that the reason for this halfheartedness is not that the health-care industry has especially charming lobbyists. No, the real villain in our health-care saga is not K Street, but the American voting public.

People in other countries seem reasonably willing to trust that if their government says a drug isnt worth it, then they dont need it. Americans tend to think that they are entitled to second-guess the government at every turn.

Our health-care system reflects that: We give doctors immense autonomy to prescribe any course of treatment they can think up, without some regulator tut-tutting over the national formulary. Unfortunately, that autonomy comes at a price. Almost 20 percent of gross domestic product, in fact.

And maybe we shouldnt say no. We are, after all, an incredibly rich country. If it costs us a boatload of money to buy marginal life extensions for American citizens, whos to say thats not money well spent?

But even if you believe we ought to say no more often, youre not going to get very far with that belief unless you can convince a whole lot of voters. In theory, Americans may be all for a cheaper health-care system. In practice, when anyone tries to limit their choices, they stampede to the nearest legislator with outraged complaints.

Until that mindset changes, baby steps forward are about the best we can do  which means that for the foreseeable future, well continue to have the most expensive health-care system in the world.

Tampa Bay Times,Answers to 12 questions you may have about using medical marijuana in Florida,"Medical marijuana became broadly legal in Florida nearly 15 months ago, after an overwhelming number of Floridians, about 71 percent, approved a constitutional amendment that expanded the list of qualified medical conditions. Medical marijuana is available in Florida, but remains illegal under federal law.

Now that it has come to Pasco, the Tampa Bay Times compiled a list of frequently asked questions about this new medication.

How do I become a legal medical marijuana patient?

A Florida resident who wants to become a medical marijuana patient must do the following:

1. See a qualified physician for a certification exam.

Florida has nearly 1,300 physicians  including 20 in Pasco County  qualified and registered to determine if a patient should use medical marijuana. Physicians do an initial exam, take into account medical records and may diagnose a qualifying condition.

2. Register and obtain a medical marijuana use registry identification card.

A qualified physician places potential patients on the states medical marijuana use registry, so they can apply for the state identification card. Potential patients, or their caregivers, must submit an application to the states Office of Medical Marijuana Use, either mailed-in or online, with a copy of a state ID or proof of residency and the required $75 fee. An approved passport photo is required with the application if its being mailed to the office. Identification cards expire one year after the approved date. Patients or caregivers can renew the card by submitting an application 45 days before the expiration date.

3. Purchase medication at a state-licensed medical marijuana dispensary.

No medical marijuana dispensaries are operating in Pasco County, but they could be soon. Until then, patients can buy from two dispensing stores in Tampa  Surterra Wellness and Trulieve. Delivery is available to the Tampa Bay area from a handful of companies in Florida.

How long does it take to get a medical marijuana registry identification card?

It usually takes about two to four weeks. According to a recent release from the states Office of Medical Marijuana Use, paper applications were processed in about 23 days, and online applications took about 17 days. However, patients no longer have to wait for a physical card to come in the mail. They can temporarily use an e-mail approval from the state.

What conditions qualify?

Medical marijuana can be an alternative for a number of medical conditions, such as cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, Crohns disease, Parkinsons disease, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), terminal illnesses, or ""other debilitating medical conditions,"" the law says.

Some of those other conditions, multiple physicians told the Tampa Bay Times, could be anxiety, depression, chronic pain, endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome, sleep disorders, arthritis, fibromyalgia, autoimmune disease and gastrointestinal disorders.

Is medical marijuana covered by insurance?

Insurance does not cover costs, because medical marijuana is still illegal under federal law.

Can a doctor prescribe me medical marijuana?

No, prescribing medical marijuana is illegal under federal law. Doctors and other healthcare providers can only recommend or issue written certifications.

How do I get medical marijuana if I cant move around?

Some physicians make house calls for patients or potential patients who are unable to move around easily, such as severely sick or hospice patients. Delivery services also are an option.

Can I grow my own marijuana?

No, but a Florida judge recently granted Joe Redner, of Tampa, the ability to home-grow marijuana to treat his lung cancer. The 77-year-old strip club owner was allowed to grow marijuana for medical use as of April 11, a circuit judge in Tallahassee decided. No law change took place, because the order is pending an appeal filed by the states Department of Health.

Can I smoke medical marijuana?

State law bans smokable marijuana, but an Orlando attorney is challenging that ban.

If I use medical marijuana, will I feel high?

Not necessarily. When physicians write orders for patients, they take into account a patients needs and preferences. Patients with certain conditions, including the severe nausea or lack of appetite experienced by some cancer patients, may have orders that suggest a drug combination that gives a euphoric high, but other strains dont.

Are different products and strains available at dispensaries?

Yes. Many dispensaries offer different strains of dried marijuana specialized to treat various ailments and symptoms.

Beyond that, some dispensaries offer oils, concentrates, liquids that can be vaporized, topical ointments, pills, edibles, wax and accessories.

Will I test positive for THC?

It depends on the product. Patients using cannabidiol, or CBD medicines, may not test positive. Other cannabis medications will cause patients to test positive.

How do I find a doctor, dispensary or delivery service?

Tampa Bay Times,Florida’s medical marijuana program is attracting troubled doctors: ‘It’s like the Wild Wild West’,"Debbie Knight had battled painful arthritis for years and hoped medical marijuana could provide some relief.

So one day in February, the 57-year-old Elvis and Cher impersonator scoured the internet, looking for the best doctor who could grant her access to Florida’s new program.

Fort Lauderdale 420 Marijuana Doctors was the closest and the cheapest. The office was in a safe part of town. And it reassured her that the business appeared to be a legitimate franchise, with sister offices in Miami and Jacksonville.

“I figured it’s like a little McDonald’s cannabis chain,” Knight said.

Then she walked into the office in Plantation.

It smelled like dirty, sweaty shoes. Crumpled fast-food bags dotted the doctor’s exam room. Papers and other junk piled up on the desk.

A young assistant asked her to pay $200, instead of the $80 that Knight saw online.

“Right there, I was ready to walk out the door, and I should have,” Knight said.

Dr. Khaja Chisty called Knight into his office for her exam, which Knight said consisted of a few questions. As she left, Chisty said her name would be entered into the state’s registry of patients allowed to buy marijuana by the following day, Knight said. Instead, weeks passed without her being added to the system.

The first time Knight called to ask why, the assistant apologized. The second time, a week later, the telephone number was disconnected.

Knight didn’t know that 14 months earlier, Chisty had agreed to stop practicing medicine in Colorado after that state’s medical board accused him of presigning and postdating prescriptions and violating other patient care standards.

He, like other medical professionals with tarnished licenses, are finding new life in Florida’s medical marijuana program.

A Tampa Bay Times examination of the 1,432 doctors in the program reveals Florida’s new marijuana initiative has turned into a magnet for physicians with troubled pasts.

The Times analyzed Department of Health data from April detailing medical board discipline, $100,000-plus malpractice cases and criminal incidents, then reviewed hundreds of doctors’ files.

In total, 262 of the doctors had some sort of blemish on their record, the Times analysis shows — nearly 1 in 5 of the doctors allowed to prescribe marijuana.

Marijuana doctors were 2.8 times as likely as other doctors to have been disciplined by the Board of Medicine, and 2.4 times as likely to have been charged with a crime. Altogether, 108 of them were responsible for $69.4 million in malpractice judgments and settlements, some for maiming or killing patients.

Some of the doctors have been fined, suspended or stripped of their licenses in other states. They’ve misdiagnosed conditions, falsified records and written prescriptions for people they never saw. They’ve been jailed for domestic violence. A few have sexually abused patients, including those as young as 14 and 16.

Experts and marijuana advocates said they were surprised by the findings. Several faulted Florida’s system for being too discouraging to good physicians.

“The whole structure is set up to make it very unattractive for your average, law-abiding physician to want to do this,” said Ben Pollara, a political consultant who is a prominent leader in Florida’s medical marijuana movement. “And so the result is you get a higher proportion of people who may not have as much respect for the laws of the land.”

Florida Rep. Katie Edwards-Walpole, D-Plantation, who was a co-sponsor of the state’s first medical marijuana legislation in 2014, said the results of the Times analysis made her “blood boil.”

She blamed the Florida Board of Medicine and state Department of Health for being too lenient, and said the law may need to be changed.

“Perhaps we need to go back and make sure that physicians that have these pending claims or have been adjudicated have a character fitness component,” she said. “This isn’t a right for physicians to be able to do this. This really is a privilege.”

Neither the health department or medical board commented directly on the Times’ analysis. But a statement from spokesman Devin Galetta touted the state’s backgrounding of physicians and called the overall process for qualifying doctors “robust” and “thorough.”

“Our top priority in administering any disciplinary action against a licensed practitioner is always patient safety,” he said.

Two years ago, voters approved a constitutional amendment to expand Florida’s marijuana program to include those suffering from cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV-AIDS, post traumatic stress, Parkinson’s disease and a host of other ailments.

All that’s required is a letter of recommendation from a physician. The physician adds a patient’s name to a state database, and the state issues a card that lets him or her receive medical cannabis from an approved dispensary.

Floridians are increasingly warming to the idea.

Approximately 100,576 people are registered in the state’s medical marijuana program, and experts expect those numbers to steadily increase.

The state has slashed the length of the course doctors must take from eight hours to two, and the price of joining the program has dropped from $995 to $250. Still, doctor enlistments have lagged.

Pollara says Florida requires doctors to include specific details in their marijuana recommendations — details that make the document look like a prescription.

Because prescribing medical marijuana is illegal under federal law, some physicians are reluctant to join out of fear of being prosecuted or blacklisted by hospitals and other medical centers, said Ron Watson, executive director of the Florida Society of Cannabis Physicians.

“Hospital systems and nursing homes and hospices, they don’t even want this on their property because they’re scared that they might lose all their Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements,” Watson said. “If the hospital in their little town says, ‘Whoops, sorry, no more hospital staff privileges,’ what are you going to do?”

The Times review shows that physicians with soiled histories are increasingly filling in the gap.

At least 45 doctors in the program were accused by the Department of Health of prescribing drugs without doing proper checks.

Dr. Richard Daniel Potts of Ormond Beach was fined $2,500 in 2015 after the department said that he admitted to leaving six presigned blank prescriptions with a secretary. “I was going out of town, and I thought it was commonplace, but I’ve come to find out it was a really bad idea,” he told the Times.

In 2007, New York prosecutors charged Dr. Robert Gregory Carlson of Land O’Lakes with writing thousands of prescriptions for human growth hormone and other drugs for patients he never saw. They said he was part of an interstate steroids ring funneling prescriptions to professional baseball players, football players, pro wrestlers and other celebrities. He ultimately pleaded guilty to insurance fraud, and Florida allowed him to keep his license. Carlson did not respond to requests for comment.

Dr. Jay D. Ellenby, a plastic surgeon, began a seven-year affair with a patient and prescribed her a mix of powerful antidepressants and anxiety medication without proper documentation, according to a health department administrative complaint. Florida’s medical board fined Ellenby $5,000 in 2005 and ordered extra training and 50 hours of community service. Two years ago, he retired from plastic surgery. Last year the 82-year-old became chairman of MediCannaVision Inc., a St. Petersburg subsidiary of a Nevada-based entertainment company aiming to establish medical marijuana healthcare centers throughout Florida, state corporate records show. In an interview, Ellenby denied the allegations. He said he has stepped down from MediCannaVision’s board.

Some doctors in the program have struggled with drug and alcohol problems.

Dr. Victor Maquera of Clay County agreed to a $2,000 fine after a health department complaint said he improperly prescribed himself phentermine and testosterone from November 2011 to May 2013. Maquera could not be reached for comment.

Dr. Naglaa Abdel-Al of Orlando was an Arizona anesthesiologist when she decided to walk away during a 2010 surgery. She was later found in a daze in a nearby bathroom, high on the sedative Diprivan, according to an Arizona Medical Board order. Abdel-Al lost her ability to practice in eight states. But after finishing a year-long treatment program, she was returned to full privileges in Florida.

Abdel-Al said she’s no longer seeing marijuana patients because she didn’t have a large enough client base.

Other doctors were accused of acting inappropriately toward female patients.

When Dr. Robert Fietsam of Wesley Chapel worked at the Manatee County jail in 2014, he told an inmate he “loved” her and asked her to invent a medical problem so he could see her, according to a health department complaint. Fietsam told the Times he had phone conversations with a female inmate but said he was giving her religious counseling and the conversations were not romantic.

In an extreme case, psychiatrists described Dr. Stanley Dratler in 1985 as a sadist and sex addict after complaints that he fondled six patients, including two teenage girls aged 14 and 16. After a three-year suspension, Dratler took a medical job with the Florida Department of Corrections.

Dratler told the Times he’s been sober for 32 years and now only does house calls for elderly clients. “I obtained my marijuana certification only so that I could offer it to my patients,” he said. “Currently, I have no patients that I have prescribed any marijuana products for.”

Allegations have already surfaced of patients being hampered by some doctors’ profiteering.

Some physicians are traveling up and down the state, showing up at makeshift clinics that open suddenly and close unexpectedly, said Pat Deluca, a medical marijuana advocate who is executive director of Compassionate Cannabis Clinic in Venice. He says these traveling doctors often disappear after collecting the cash, and can’t be reached for weeks.

He says his clinic takes in 10 to 15 new people monthly who say their initial marijuana physician disappeared.

“It’s like the Wild Wild West,” Deluca said. “With everyone doing his own thing.”

In Colorado, patients of Chisty — the physician at Fort Lauderdale 420 Marijuana Doctors — flooded online sites with allegations of absenteeism, poor customer service and unethical price manipulations. There he owned Happy Minds, a psychiatric practice in Thornton, 10 miles northeast of Denver.

The Colorado Medical Board subsequently accused Chisty of presigning and postdating prescriptions and then leaving the country for weeks, according to an order written by the board.

Last month, he admitted to writing prescriptions to patients without giving them full examinations and other “unprofessional conduct,” according to another board order in Colorado. His license is currently inactive.

Florida officials filed a disciplinary action against him last September, citing his case in Colorado. The Florida case is still ongoing.

Knight believes she was scammed and that the same may happen to others.

“Half the people are going to pay the $200. If they want the (card) they’re just going to pay it,” she said. “But they are not going to get anything.”

Chisty told the Times he didn’t remember Knight’s case but that he would not dispute her description of Fort Lauderdale 420’s offices. He said that sometimes patients didn’t get entered into the state registry because they never turned over their medical records. He said he would have to review Knight’s file in order to know what happened in her case.

Chisty insisted the prices and office upkeep were handled solely by the clinic’s owner, a California-based company called the Supreme Medical Group. He said he is just a contractor at the company’s Miami, Plantation, Orlando and Jacksonville locations. He also sees patients in Sunnyvale, CA.

Chisty said some complaints had been filed about him with the Department of Health, but added, “I think it’s a bit unfair to target me.”

He said rampant abuses are occurring. One Florida clinic where he previously worked regularly took patients’ money without entering their names into the registry, he said. At another clinic, the owners ordered the physicians to approve all patients for medical marijuana, regardless of whether their medical conditions qualified, Chisty said. He quit after one week.

“Everybody wants to blame the doctors because there’s no one else to blame here. But the bigger problem is those owners who are motivated by profits and nothing else,” he said.

Fort Lauderdale 420’s management did not respond to a request for comment. A man who answered the company’s phone Thursday denied the clinic was dirty, but would not give his full name.

Galetta, the health department spokesman, said Chisty asked for a formal hearing to contest the state’s effort to discipline him. A date for that hearing has not been set. “During this time, the department continues to engage in negotiations of settlement to determine whether we can reach a reasonable resolution,” Galetta said.

After the recent complaints, Chisty said he has stopped seeing all marijuana clients. He is planning to quit Florida’s program and reapply for his medical license in Colorado.

“I’m sick and tired of this,” he said “After seeing these complaints, I’m like, ‘Oh my God.’ It just doesn’t make any sense here.”

Tampa Bay Times,Pasco residents find relief in medical marijuana,"For many, medical marijuana is still a taboo topic.

Physicians and patients who spoke with the Tampa Bay Times brought up the stigma surrounding the drug and the people who use it, rooted in longtime notions about marijuana. In 2016, Florida voters approved marijuana use for those a wide array of medical conditions, but the drug is still classified as illegal by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

Some patients agreed to be interviewed, but didnt want to be identified, fearing judgment by friends and family, or retaliation from employers.

However, a few patients were willing to lend their names so others could learn how the new medication is working for them.

Here are their stories:

  

Kristina Risola experiences both sides of the medical marijuana coin.

On one side, she is director of operations at Florida Medical Cannabis Clinic, a year-old medical marijuana clinic with offices in Land O Lakes and Spring Hill.

On the other side, Risola, 33, of Hudson, is a legal medical marijuana patient with severe chronic pain. She recites her conditions like a grocery list: fibromyalgia, endometriosis, post traumatic stress, anxiety, gastrointestinal conditions, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.

She became a marijuana patient after a car accident last May that left her with multiple back injuries.

Scott Gebhardt, her long-time friend and colleague, suggested she try medical marijuana. Although skeptical, she listened.

For years, she dealt with pain so severe that it woke her out of her sleep. She self-medicated with marijuana for at least six years.""

""On no level did I expect how profoundly it was going to change my life,"" Risola said. ""Having the access to it completely changed my life.""

Risola became a legal patient on June 30 and made her first medical cannabis purchase a few days later, on July 4.

The first capsule she took left her speechless. Immediately, she texted Gebhardt.

""It evens me out,"" Risola said. ""I feel like a normal human being when I have my medicine."" For the next nine months, Risola slept through the night without pain and began to lose the weight she had gained.

She vapes, inhaling small doses every few hours. At night, she uses higher dosage products, like edibles or capsules that are ""more relaxing, more sedating.""

Many colleagues and friends were surprised she used marijuana, Risola said. Some pulled her aside with questions.

""I had to tell them, like look, if youve interacted with me in the last six years that Ive been sick, chances are I was probably using cannabis at the time,"" Risola said. ""When I tell them that, its like ... (they) cant even comprehend it.""

Candace Leary, 47, of New Port Richey, calls medical marijuana a godsend. She and four of her sisters have Huntingtons disease, a fatal, genetic disorder that diminishes nerve cells in the brain, causing difficulties in movement, plus cognitive and behavioral changes.

Tampa neurologist Dr. Juan Sanchez-Ramos recommended that Leary try medical marijuana, she said. She learned about Dr. Tanmay Patel, who has an office in New Port Richey, when her son picked up the doctors card at a local smoke shop.

Patel recommended a tincture taken under the tongue, three times a day. It has quelled her anxiety and the uncontrollable rage that are symptoms of Huntingtons, Leary said. Sometimes she had ""blackouts"" that lasted for days and could not recall lashing out at friends and family.

""It was so embarrassing. But ever since Ive been on the medical marijuana, I have had no rage episodes,"" she said. ""I cant say enough about it. Its truly changed my home life  everything.""

Leary, who has been treated for chronic pain for 15 years, has reduced her other pain medication.

""I hate taking pills,"" she said. ""So many of the pharmaceuticals have (side effects). I dont have side effects from the medical marijuana.""

The initial costs to obtain medical marijuana were expensive, said Leary. But she and Patel have found a recipe that works.

""We go slow,"" she said, adjusting her dosage at follow-up appointments.

Because of her diminished brain capacity, Leary relied on her son and husband to help her obtain a medical marijuana card. The Truelieve dispensary in Tampa delivers her tincture for a $25 charge.

""People who are going on that are not in the best medical health, and I think it should be easier,"" said Leary, who shared her experience in her support group.

""Im not worried about being judged,"" she said. ""Its not like its illegal. Thats why we made it legal  to help people. Im not going to quit talking about it, especially if it helps people. Its a miracle drug for me.""

In 1985, Beth Williams was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 24.

""They told me I had six months to live,"" she said.

Shes still here.

Williams, 56, moved from Maine to Hudson, Florida, last summer. Various medications have kept her alive, she said, but they often come with side effects, including a rapid drop in weight from 208 to 127 pounds.

""Some of the drugs they give you are toxic,"" she said. ""It (medical marijuana) helps with my nausea. It helps with my appetite when I cant eat. It helps arthritis in my back, because it seems to relax my muscles. It helps me sleep. Its an all-in-one for me.""

While living in Maine, Williams said she smoked medical marijuana at a cost of about $10 a gram. Since moving to Florida, she uses the vapor form, as recommended by Patel.

Paying out of pocket can be difficult, Williams said. A recent visit to the dispensary cost her $225 for a months supply

""Its a lot more expensive than the old-fashioned way of smoking it,"" she said. ""Im a single mom going through a divorce, with limited income, on disability. I dont know how I can go without, because it helps me.""

The lack of local dispensaries increases the burden, Leary said.

""I have to travel 45 minutes to an hour to go to the dispensary in Tampa,"" she said. ""They deliver statewide for a $25 delivery charge, but when you are already strapped, that just adds to it.""

Nearly every 28 days, Brian Moores pain management doctor takes a few more opioid pills off his lengthy list of ""heavy"" medications, he said.

For more than 25 years, Moore, 57, has suffered from multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the nervous system.

To cope with chronic pain, Moore took four morphine pills and three oxycontin pills each day, and sometimes Valium, he said. Now that hes a medical marijuana patient, he doesnt need as many opioids.

""You cant rewire my body. There aint no cure, aint no fixing (MS),"" Moore said, ""(but) not eating a lot of those pain pills is going to make me a little more healthy.""

Moore, of New Port Richey, became a legal patient at the end of January. Since then, he said, he hasnt had a bad MS attack, and his pain management doctor eliminated opioid pills he took for more than 15 years. It happened so quickly, Moore said, he had withdrawal symptoms.

His cannabidiol oil, or CBD, relaxes his nervous system, he said. He uses liquid drops beneath his tongue, or a tincture, and vaporizing.

""(Medical marijuana) will relax me enough where I can go have lunch with my wife or walk the beach,"" Moore said.

He said it wasnt hard to sell him on using medical marijuana.

""As soon as I saw relief written on the bottle, I said I want that one,"" Moore said about the first time he purchased it. ""I dont want to sit here and be stoned all day. I want something to relieve (the pain) so I can be active, and (medical marijuana) helps me a lot.""

However, medical marijuana costs can be daunting compared to his other medications, which are covered by insurance.

""I cant just smoke this. Ill go broke,"" Moore said.

At a minimum, he said, his medicine costs about $500 for a 70-day supply. He pays an additional $165 each time he visits the doctor.

Regardless of the expense, Moore is ""a firm believer."" Medical marijuana makes it possible, eventually, for a person to stop using opioids, he said.

""It would just be up to the person on how long it takes them to get off all the pills,"" Moore said.

Tampa Bay Times,Time runs out for last grove,"ODESSA

The trees were so heavy with oranges that their limbs stooped to the ground, the scent of their blossoms distracting drivers who rolled their windows down. Their branches were so thick with leaves and clumped with fruit that deer would tangle their antlers in them. Adam Burchenal couldnt say no 11 years ago when his grandfather offered him a job here, at Cee Bees Citrus Emporium.

In the beginning, he was the manager of the juice room. When Adam reported for work in the mornings, the sunlight was golden on the orange rinds. Some 15,000 trees painted long shadows on the 300 acres of farmland where Hillsborough County bumps up against Pinellas and Pasco.

He spent his days watching the oranges blur into a pulpy slush, scraping the dregs at the machines bottom into the best Popsicles he had ever tasted. Before a date, Adam would pick out a shirt and pants and leave them for hours in the juice room, his secret cologne.

But that was a long time ago, and now the juice Adam mixes with ice and protein powder and calls breakfast comes from another farm. The juice room has been shut down for years, ever since the trees thinned out and his grandfather realized they were losing money on every bottle sold.

Now Adam took a sip as he stood outside the family business on Boy Scout Road. The morning was darker and cooler than usual, an hour lost to Daylight Savings just the week before. He put his knee in the dirt, trying to tie up a banner that the wind kept flapping down:

STORE CLOSING

EVERYTHING MUST GO

Adam, 31, dusted off his hands and climbed into his truck. He needed to pick oranges. The Valencias ripen late; some were still dotting the trees. He had taken the Cee Bees website down, but two orders snuck in before it went dark. A reason to keep going, even if for just a while longer.

It is no secret that a disease known as citrus greening has devastated the Florida orange industry, and that a cure evades top scientists, who, even as you read this, are sealing petri dishes with cellophane and prayer.

Science is close to  if not a solution  a variety of work-arounds that allow orange trees infected with greening to live for years. Some experiments are bearing especially exciting results, trees lush with leaves and oranges, ready for sale.

But thousands of growers have already called it quits. Thousands more are living season-to-season with one eye on Lake Alfred, a small town east of Lakeland thats become ground-zero for citrus greening experiments.

And Tampa Bay is about to lose its last true commercial orange grove.

In Adams mind, the downfall is an out-of-order montage. He doesnt remember when they started growing lettuce, tomatoes, even pomegranates and kale to try to turn a profit. Hes not sure which year they began Frankenstein-like experiments in the groves, praying for oranges that looked, well  orange.

It was the end of the season, and the disease hadnt left much. He drove past a mass grave of trees, long-dead and piled high.

Adam kept driving until he spotted a tree still bundled in leaves. He stood on his toes as he reached for the fruit, hanging on the canopy, almost out of his grasp.

We put it on our license plates, serve its juice at our visitor centers, smack ""Fresh from Florida"" on every carton we can; send our kids to Orange Grove Middle School, build houses in Citrus Park and sign leases in Citrus Village (a preferred apartment community!). We throw down at the Orange Bowl. Fight over where to put Tropicana Field.

Yet Florida is slated to produce only 45 million boxes of oranges this year. Thats one-quarter of what it was 10 years ago. Its the lowest production since World War II. California now sells more oranges. Brazil sells more juice.

But those are not the numbers that keep Mike Sparks awake at night. The chief executive of Florida Citrus Mutual, the states largest organization of growers, Sparks knows that the true question isnt whether well solve greening.

Its whether theyll be anyone left to grow oranges when we do.

There were 76,000 jobs in the citrus industry  everyone from the pickers in the field and the flat-bed truck drivers to the packing-house barons and their receptionists  when Adam came to Cee Bees a decade ago. Now there are 31,000 jobs, a 59 percent drop.

Growers  people like Adam and his grandfather  have disappeared at a similar rate. Where there were once 8,000 in Florida, there are now 3,800.

""Were getting down to a make-it-or-break-it for the Florida citrus industry,"" says Sparks, who was part of the Florida Department of Citrus team that put the orange on the license plate decades ago. He remembers celebrating, the high-fiving, the champagne. ""Mobile billboards,"" they called the plates.

And now.

A quarter of Floridas citrus acreage is gone. Twenty-five processing plants have become 12, and theyre not operating at capacity. The state has lost $2 billion in economic impact, and it would have lost so much more, except the price of oranges and juice have gone up for the consumer.

Initial reports for this season showed promise that, for the first time in five years, orange production would go up. Scientists cheered: Their research was paying off. Then Hurricane Irma knocked all that fruit off the trees.

""You have to be honest with the growers, you know: Youve gone through the 10 most difficult years in Florida citrus, and theres a light at the end of the tunnel, and the industry will make it, but will they be a part of this future?"" Sparks says. ""Many of these growers are fourth- or fifth-generation with a sixth on the way. If you take the risk, if we win the fight against (greening), if we can keep all the infrastructure and processors going, its going to be financially rewarding.

""But thats a lot of ifs.""

Florida Citrus Mutual used to call downtown Lakeland its headquarters, with a building that took up an entire city block on E Orange Street.

About a year and a half ago, it sold its headquarters to Publix. Sparks now has a small office in a BB&T building in Bartow.

""We right-sized.""

When Adams grandfather bought Cee Bees in the 1990s, it was much smaller and in a sorry state. The citrus trees were strangled by vines and crowded by overgrown oaks. The soil was starving. Heirloom trees wilted, listening for last rites.

The best land to grow oranges used to be in north and central Florida. The colder temperatures in the winters made the juice sweeter. But crop-killing freezes drove most growers south. Tampa Bay planted housing developments in their wake.

William Burchenal Jr., who was in his 60s and went by Bill, wasnt the obvious buyer for this neglected grove. Once an electrical engineer for the Air Force during the Korean War, he made a small fortune in advertising and real estate.

He had never grown citrus, but he had admired it as a student at Eckerd College and the University of South Florida. And he had lived an adventurous life, traveling to five continents, sailboat racing to Cuba and playing the jazz drum. He did not plan to slow down now.

So he got down on his hands and knees and turned the grove around, enlisting the help of Les Dennison and his family. The Dennisons had been growing Florida citrus for 100 years, even cultivating this grove when it was first planted in the 1920s. In just a few seasons, the fruit came in. And the grove grew, parcel by parcel.

In the early days, it was just Bill and Les, picking oranges in the mornings, cleaning and sorting in the afternoon. At the end of the day, they would drive their haul out to restaurants, colleges and hotels.

Cee Bees soon supplied all the citrus for Pasco and Hillsborough public schools, and fresh-squeezed orange juice for Eckerd. The staff grew to 19. In 2002, Cee Bees came online. It started marketing oranges as a delicacy to down-wrapped northerners, until this was the bulk of its business.

Sometimes, Bill and his staff would get calls. ""You sent me some green fruit,"" the customers said. But this was before this disease  huanglongbing, or HLB, as it was known by scientists  and Bill would patiently explain that they did not gas and dye their fruit like the oranges at the grocery store. There was nothing to worry about.

They survived canker, cold weather and the fitness generations realization that there are calories in orange juice. Bill fixed up a small house on the land, yards from a lake they shared with the Winn-Dixie family. He and his wife would sit on a bench swing and look out at the water after a long days work. Deer and turkeys darted through the trees, even panthers once in a while.

One day, Bill put his arm around Adams shoulders. They were on a family vacation to Italy, walking the canals of Venice.

Here he asked his grandson to join him at Cee Bees. Adam was born in Tampa, but had moved to Austin as a child while his father got his doctorate at the University of Texas. Adam had stayed there, earning a business degree at a small college in Austin and managing a bagel shop.

Now he saw an opportunity to be closer to his grandfather and escape a franchise for a family business.

It was 2007. Some of the trees at Cee Bees, like at most other orange farms, were starting to show symptoms. The leaves were a little smaller. Some of the fruit felt hard and fell off the tree too soon.

Bill Burchenal was worried. He was. But he had already saved the place so many times, and he reckoned he might be able to do it again, this time with his grandson.

He just didnt realize what they were up against.

Upon re-entering the country after travel abroad, Americans are required to fill out a blue and white U.S. customs form, typically distributed in flight. While it is usually a coming to Jesus about how much was truly spent on souvenirs, there is a key question:

I am (We are) bringing

(a) fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, food, insects: Yes or no?

How did greening, once the distant scourge of China, India and South Africa, make its way to Florida to destroy a signature crop and a way of life? Could it be because someone checked ""no"" when he should have checked ""yes""?

This is something Michael Rogers, director of the Citrus Research and Education Center at the University of Florida, thinks about often. One day in 2005, he was sitting in a conference room, meeting with citrus processors, when his phone buzzed. He had a text:

""It is here.""

In that moment, it felt as though a bomb had gone off, Rogers says now, the shock coming in waves. He and his colleagues had seen what greening had done to citrus around the world. The enemy had been lurking abroad for more than a century.

Citrus greening is a disease carried by the Diaphorina citri, a sap-sucking insect thats of little threat on its own. Commonly called the Asian citrus psyllid, the brown-mottled bug tested negative for the disease when it was first found in Florida in 1998. Rogers believes the infection traveled separately, smuggled in a carry-on bag.

The thing to understand is that, when it comes to growing oranges, theres no such thing as an ""orange tree."" Each variety  Valencias, navels, tangerines  is a forced marriage, often from two wildly different plants.

The rootstock, usually a stump with a healthy root system, is wed to a scion, typically a bud or a shoot. For instance: oranges sometimes sprout from roots designed by nature for lemons.

Orange growers love these unconventional unions because they can make a tree more resistant to cold weather; and, like a cook tinkering with a family recipe, growers take pride in creating their own breed of perfection.

All it took, then, was a one-inch piece of green wood  a twig  and a grower who wanted to bring his own variety stateside, to bring down the Florida orange. ""Ive heard people get caught at customs with it in their socks and underwear,"" Rogers says.

Once the disease was here, it was everywhere. Greening is so contagious that when one tree gets it, they all do. It took a few years for the symptoms to fully appear, years of dismissing problems as an off season or bad nutrition.

Then suddenly it was undeniable: the small leaves, streaked pale green or blotched yellow. The limbs so bare that you could see through each tree to the next one, skinny with the same sickness. The fruit came in too small, too hard. It fell to the ground too early. It shaded green. It tasted bitter.

More than one scientist has likened citrus greenings effect on Floridas orange trees to what AIDS did to a generation of humans in the 1980s, and its not hard to see why. The disease makes it impossible for the tree to stay healthy. The roots shrink and swell, unable to move water or nutrients up to the canopy. Think about trying to suck a blueberry through a straw. Without water, the tree cant hold the oranges up.

At the same time, the leaves are converting sunlight into carbohydrates and sugar: photosynthesis 101. But with greening, they arent able to get the sugar into the trees circulatory system. It gets stuck in the leaves, becomes starch and messes up, well, everything.

At least 80 percent, and maybe more than 90 percent, of Floridas citrus acreage is infected with greening. Once a tree is infected, there is no cure. You can rip it all up and start over; but unless the neighboring grove follows suit, and the one next to that, and that, and that 

Its just going to come back.

  

The best fruit is toward the center of the tree. Adam almost disappeared inside of it, moving through the leaves with the instinctive ease of an animal. His Cee Bees hat was on backward, his sunglasses pushed up over his forehead. Adam cant pick oranges with them on anymore; the tint disguised the green rinds as healthy.

He headed back to the store, the Valencias heavy in his pickers bag.

Adams grandfather didnt share the numbers, but it was obvious they were losing money. After greening came, Adam doesnt think there was a year in the black. They used to send out ""trailer-loads upon trailer-loads of citrus"" a season, maybe 35, Adam remembers. ""Now wed be lucky to get five.""

The concessions were many. They built a greenhouse for tomatoes and lettuce. They planted pomegranate and peach trees and bushes of blueberries, farmed kale, broccoli and turnips.

It took five years for Adam to persuade his grandfather to put in an ice cream machine, and they sold novelty orange cones for a few dollars apiece. They tried cutting down on herbicide and fertilizer. They turned off one of the two fans in the juice room. Then they started laying off staff. That was the hardest part.

Adam and his grandfather began talking with UFs citrus scientists, as well as a few at USF. Researchers had ideas about experimental rootstocks and fertilizer regimens. Those efforts would allow trees to survive years longer and produce fruit as sweet and orange as they had ever been, as an HIV-infected person can now live for decades. The Burchenals said yes. They had nothing to lose.

Les son, Mike Dennison, had become the grove manager after his father passed away. He helped plant new rootstocks and tried different fertilizers and spray programs.

Mike tested something called Aqua-Yield, which makes the nutrients so tiny that they can slip through the shrunken roots.

Farming is a game of patience. New trees take years to grow, to bear viable fruit. Sick trees need time to get better.

Bill had high blood pressure and a tricky heart. A cold would put him out for six weeks. As his health faded in late 2016, he told his grandson, ""If there is any way to keep it going, keep it going."" But: ""Do what youve got to do."" He passed away three days after Christmas.

""One of his real regrets, one of his great disappointments,"" said Adams father, Ken, ""is he wasnt able to see it get to be sustainable, to be able to survive greening.""

Ken moved back from Austin to help on the farm and look after his mother. Thats when Adam and his father first saw the numbers. Cee Bees was losing an astonishing amount of money, and had been for years. ""Dad was able to swallow the bottom line,"" Ken said. ""The rest of the family didnt have the resources to cover it.""

Adam and his father realized this would be their last season.

The fruit started coming in November. ""Ironically,"" Ken said, ""this has been the best year in a long time.""

  

Early one morning on the last day of March, Jude Grosser, a plant genetics professor and citrus researcher, walked through the groves of UFs Lake Alfred campus. Just 15 miles from Lakeland, its the staging site of the countrys best guesses to crush greening.

On one stretch of land, they grow orange trees under screens to keep out the Asian psyllid. In another grove, theyve tied ribbons  blue, pink, green, striped  in a real-life paternity test of which variety has been bred with which.

Before greening came, Grosser was trying to develop oranges better-suited for not-for-concentrate juice. Now, he has been breeding sugarbells, a cross between a clementine and a honeybell. They have survived 14-degree winters, and he and his colleagues found that varieties tolerant of harsh environments do the best against greening.

""Our work is often like this: If after four years, two of these trees dont have greening, why is that?"" he said. ""Are they the last two to get infected? Or are they different somehow?""

Climbing into his truck, Grosser eases through rows of cybrids: oranges whose nuclei have been replaced with that of another species, like a grapefruit. Out the window grows Cybrid 304, a big tangerine thats easy to peel and crosses well with other oranges. Theyve grown so full that their branches scrape against the trucks side as Grosser moves through them. ""Theyre all infected,"" he said. ""But they dont care.""

This is the difference between immunity and tolerance. The UF team, the premier citrus researchers in the country, want to find a tree thats immune to greening. But they also recognize that cure could be decades off. In the meantime, theyre chasing trees that are tolerant, growing vibrantly despite infection.

""That might be the best were ever going to get,"" said Fred Gmitter, a citrus breeding and genetics researcher who works alongside Grosser.

Part of what these scientists are trying to do is figure out why some varieties succeed while others dont. They know, for instance, that oranges with seeds are more devastated than those without. In the beginning, honey murcotts didnt stand a chance.

Theyve identified promising rootstocks that dont lose their feeder roots like most trees do when first infected. But ask them why they are so successful. ""We have no idea,"" Grosser says.

There are 2,000 genes that they can play up or down and see whether the tree fares better. But which gene is the right target? Are there five targets? ""Its like picking through that haystack and finding needles,"" Gmitter says, ""but finding the right needles.""

They know that replacing the oranges NPR-1 gene, which affects the immune system, with the same gene from a mustard plant works wonders. A Hamlin orange tree with the swapped-out gene is tolerant going on year six.

Thats good news  great, even  except that it has historically taken scientists up to 20 years to determine if a tree is ready for commercial release. But given the urgency of greening, given the decimation, UF has been doing things differently. It is recruiting growers as researchers.

Beginning in the fall, and running through spring, UF hosts five displays of any trees in its pipeline that look promising. Growers are invited to come through and evaluate the sample trees, ranking the varieties theyd most like to try in the field. Then theyre given a clipping of the tree, and asked to send feedback.

Pete Spyke, a third-generation citrus grower and long-time citrus consultant, owns the roadside Orange Shop in Citra, 15 miles north of Ocala. The porch here is bundled with bushels of large, lovely fruit, almost technicolor in their orange hue.

Spyke says greening is not a problem for him anymore.

He was one of the first large growers to get involved with the fight against greening, traveling to China and South Africa on expeditions with scientists and other growers.

Spyke grew 30 different varieties, flooding them with fertilizer and water. He found the ones that worked: navel, Valencia, temple, page, nova, Minneola. He replanted more than once, bankrolled by the luxuries of money and time. And he doesnt seem to be going anywhere.

Its the smaller growers who havent been able to hold on.

""They put their heart and soul into it,"" says Sparks, the head of the growers group.

""Its just hard to accept that, you know. That not everyone is going to be a part of the Florida oranges future.""

The last one in Hillsborough tried to be, up until the end.

  

Back at the store, Adam shook out his bag of oranges. They tumbled onto a conveyor belt, slowly rolling toward a dripping wall, layering them with a light sweater of soap.

The fruit came out the other side spinning, knocking into each other as they headed for an air dryer. The excess water became puddles below the machine, now emitting heat and a motor roar. The Valencias appeared to glisten now, some like the Technicolor dream at Spykes shop.

Adam stood at one end of the machine, inspecting the oranges before their next spin. He picked one up, inspected it for a moment. Then wound up his arm and threw it over his shoulder. He picked up another, and he threw that one away, too. He didnt look to see it land at the base of a tree, surrounded by other fruit that had missed the mark, that he had thought was healthy when he picked it but, in the end, was green.

How sad it is to be an orange that isnt orange.

The survivors were packaged and sent to Nashville, Tenn., and Augusta, Maine.

""Im going to miss this gig,"" a customer, Scott Archibald, was heard saying loudly from the adjoining store. He picked through tomatoes.

""Man, me, too,"" said the receptionist. Some of their customers had been oblivious to greening. The out-of-towners seemed the most in the loop.

""Ill keep coming till the doors locked,"" said Scott. The door swung shut behind him.

Adam was not sure what would come next, for him or for the land. The best-case-scenario was to sell to someone who wanted to make a go at oranges. But who would be crazy enough to do that, he wondered. Maybe the beekeepers who leased some land for their honey would want it. Or someone else who would keep this place rural, when so little else in the area still was.

Adam walked into the little office building he shared with his dad and the few remaining staff. His grandfathers obituary was pinned to the bulletin board behind his desk. The two of them were so similar, he said: Both shaped like blocks, both hard of hearing, the same-sounding whistle. He tried to imagine what it would be like to see all of his grandfathers trees ripped out of the ground. The thought was crushing, he said. Even worse than the disease.

Closing wouldnt be a big, grand thing, Adam said. They would lock up the store at the end of the season, probably June 2. They would hold a goodbye-barbecue for their customers. Sell what they could of the equipment at an auction. Meet with buyers, until it was done.

And there was one more thing.

Deep in the farm sits that pile of dead trees so high and long that it takes several minutes to walk around it and a craned neck to see the top properly. These are the skeletons of all kinds of orange trees, most of them killed by greening. There is not a leaf on the bone-like branches, only weeds poking through them; no life except for the ants belly-crawling from soft hills.

Sometime during the rainy season, Adam and his crew will paint the pile with diesel fuel, and throw a match on top. They will burn it all down, back to the soil. The bonfire will take all afternoon. And there in the flames, for one last time, the trees will be orange.

Tampa Bay Times,How Barbara Bush broke a shameful national silence on AIDS,"When the news of the passing of Barbara Bush hit on Tuesday, my mind immediately went back to a 1989 photo of her cradling a baby. A grandmother holding an infant isnt shocking. But when the grandmother was the new first lady and the child was infected with AIDS, the photo spoke volumes.

Not two months before Bushs visit to an AIDS hospice in Washington, her husband, President George H.W. Bush, was inaugurated to succeed Ronald Reagan. The revered and loquacious Reagan was mute on the epidemic laying waste to gay men, African Americans and other vulnerable populations. Barbara Bush broke that shameful silence with a hug and her voice.

The power of that March 22, 1989, visit to a place known as Grandmas House was captured by the Washington Posts Lois Romano.

""Mrs. Bush cradled an infant, kissed a toddler and hugged an adult AIDS victim to demonstrate a message: You can hug and pick up AIDS babies and people who have the HIV virus without hurting yourself, she said. There is a need for compassion. ""

In times of fear and national distress, the American people look to the president and the White House as much for leadership as for compassion. Bush demonstrated both with that visit. Dont underestimate the power of her message or the example she set by doing something that was so controversial at the time. She saved lives that day by bringing attention to the ignored.

 Washington Post",18/04/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Barbara Bush, matriarch of American political dynasty, dies at 92","Barbara Bush, who was the wife of one president and the mother of another and whose embrace of her image as Americas warmhearted grandmother belied her influence and mettle, died April 17. She was 92.

The office of her husband, former president George H.W. Bush, issued a statement Tuesday evening announcing her death but did not disclose the cause. Mrs. Bush was reportedly battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Her family announced two days earlier that she had ""decided not to seek additional medical treatment"" after recent hospitalizations amid her ""failing health.""

As the matriarch of one of Americas political dynasties, Bush spent a half century in the public eye. She was portrayed as the consummate wife and homemaker as her husband rose from Texas oilman to commander in chief. They had six children, the eldest of whom, George W. Bush, became president. Their eldest daughter, Robin, died at age 3 of leukemia, a tragedy that had a profound impact on the family.

ALL EYES GALLERY: A look at the legacy of Barbara Bush

Her husband served two terms as vice president under Ronald Reagan and then one as president, from 1989 to 1993. On his watch, the Cold War ended, and the nation and its allies achieved a swift and crushing victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War  before a faltering economy largely doomed his reelection prospects.

George W. Bush, a former governor of Texas, was president from 2001 to 2009, and after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he led the country into long-lasting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the rumblings of the Great Recession.

Only Abigail Adams, whose husband, John Adams, and son John Quincy Adams served as the second and sixth presidents, respectively, of the United States, shared Mrs. Bushs distinction of being the wife and mother of commanders in chief.

Another Bush son, Jeb, served two terms as Florida governor before unsuccessfully seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2016.

Mrs. Bush was proud of her familys achievements but expressed reservations  especially as Jeb Bush mounted his White House bid  about whether it was healthy in a democracy for one family to accumulate so much power.

In a ""Today"" show interview, she called Jeb Bush ""by far the best-qualified man."" But ""there are a lot of great families, and its not just four families or whatever. There are other people out there that are very qualified,"" she remarked, adding - with her characteristic bluntness - that ""weve had enough Bushes.""

But once her son entered the race, she was 100 percent in - and she did not mince words about her distaste for his primary opponent, businessman Donald Trump. In a joint interview with Jeb before the New Hampshire primary, she unflinchingly stated that it was ""incomprehensible"" to her that anyone would vote for Trump, particularly women in light of his abusive comments about them.

Instinctively understanding how Trumps apparent fondness for Russian leader Vladimir Putin might not sit well with voters, she further noted: ""Putin has endorsed him, for heavens sakes. Putin the killer, Putin the worst. Thats an endorsement you dont want.""

A relatively unknown national figure until her husband became vice president, Mrs. Bush was comfortable as a backstage force, maintaining stability during her familys more than two dozen moves before entering the vice presidents official residence in 1981.

Within the Bush clan, she was known as ""the enforcer.""

""She may be a lot of peoples grandmother,"" Jeb Bush told Newsday in 1990 when asked about his mothers soothing, even matronly persona as first lady, ""but she was our drill sergeant when we were growing up.""

By her account, she had evolved from a shy, socially ""square"" 16-year-old schoolgirl smitten at the sight of her 17-year-old future husband at a Christmas dance in Greenwich, Connecticut. At 19, she left her elite womenscollege - Smith - to marry him.

Within a few years, they would leave behind their lives of wealth and privilege in the Northeast as George H.W. Bush sought his fortune as a Texas oilman before winning a congressional seat in 1966. Mrs. Bush accompanied him across the country and around the world as he served as U.N. ambassador, leader of the Republican National Committee, U.S. envoy to China and director of the CIA before becoming Reagans running mate.

According to Peter and Rochelle Schweizers 2004 book, ""The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty,"" Barbara Bush for years maintained and meticulously curated a network of tens of thousands of contacts and friends that she saved on index cards for social and fund-raising reasons. By the time the Bushes got to the White House and automated the card file, they had a Christmas card list in excess of 10,000 names.

  

As a political spouse, she contrasted sharply with her predecessor as first lady, Nancy Reagan, who had at times generated unwanted attention with her lavish spending, designer clothes and intrusions into her husbands administration. Mrs. Bush presented herself as the antithesis of glamour and excess. She endeared herself to many with her droll frankness, boasting about her trademark triple-strand faux pearls and joking about her prematurely white hair.

The two wives were formidable women, protective of their husbands, and their relationship during the Reagan administration was noticeably icy. The Bushes were seldom invited to the Reagan White Houses family quarters.

As first lady, Mrs. Bush established the nonprofit Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, to which she donated nearly $800,000 in after-tax proceeds from her best-selling ""Millies Book"" (1990), which channeled the voice of her White House pet dog.

She also encouraged people to volunteer at homeless shelters and Head Start projects, and she promoted AIDS awareness when the disease was still highly stigmatized and misunderstood.

In 1989, she made front-page headlines when she visited Grandmas House, a pediatric AIDS care center in the District, and cradled an infant patient at a time when many people mistakenly believed the disease could be contracted through mere proximity to the virus.

She attended in 1990 the funeral of Ryan White, the teenager who had fought to return to public school in Indiana after he contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion. (Her husband signed into law what is now the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to help provide services for people with the disease, but AIDS advocates have regarded the program as inadequately funded for years.)

Mrs. Bush sat on the board of the historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta and was reported to have played a role in the selection of her friend Louis Sullivan, the president of Morehouses medical school, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

Despite her preferences for staying behind the scenes, Mrs. Bush wasnt shy about expressing her own views. At times, Mrs. Bush made public statements that seemed to conflict with her husbands policies, including his opposition to abortion rights and gun-control measures. But she adamantly resisted being pulled into discussions about personal and controversial topics, dispatching unwanted questions with salty humor or a sharp, ""Next question.""

In a rare misstep while joking with reporters, she referred to Geraldine Ferraro, her husbands vice-presidential opponent in 1984, as ""that $4 million  I cant say it, but it rhymes with rich. "" She quickly apologized.

The White House staff adopted a nickname bestowed on her by her children - the ""Silver Fox"" - and took care not to cross her. She was known to stare down aides she thought were not performing up to task for her husband.

In one incident, Mrs. Bush put Craig Fuller, chief of staff to then-Vice President Bush, on notice after friends and supporters complained that he was not returning their calls. As she watched him sift through a stack of messages, she snapped, within her husbands earshot, ""Keep looking. . . . Youll find a couple from me.""

During four years as first lady, Mrs. Bush consistently ranked among the nations most-admired women, with high poll numbers that contrasted with her husbands tumbling ratings. During the 1992 election, she was often deployed by the Bush campaign as a surrogate to humanize a president not known for charisma or the common touch.

She was, many commentators agreed, his most valuable asset in a race against then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, an agile campaigner who pounded Bush on the economy, and wild card candidate Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire running as an independent.

Mrs. Bush generally managed to avoid the sorts of intrigues and uproars that perturbed her predecessor as first lady and her eventual successor, Hillary Clinton, a lawyer and activist, who promised to be a partner in her husbands public life and memorably defended her career by remarking, ""I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas.""

In her no-nonsense way, Mrs. Bush rejected the idea of the election being a referendum on dramatic generational change and pushed back against polls that said she was better liked by the electorate than her husband.

""Nobody is jealous of me,"" she told The Washington Post. ""I mean, look at me. Who would be? Its easy to like me. They like George, and they respect him. But he has to say no to people because he has to do whats right for the country, and thats hard.""

Barbara Pierce was born in New York City on June 8, 1925, and raised in the tony suburb of Rye, New York. She was one of four children of the former Pauline Robinson, the daughter of an Ohio Supreme Court justice, and Marvin Pierce, a top executive of McCall Corp., which published Redbook and McCalls magazines.

As a child, Barbara stood out physically, having reached 5 foot 8 and 148 pounds by age 12. She once described her younger self as ""a very happy, fat child who spent all my life with my mother saying, Eat up, Martha, to my older sister and, Not you, Barbara. "" She would later talk about her mother as a humorless, unapproachable taskmaster.

She was 16 and a student at the private Ashley Hall school in Charleston, South Carolina, when she met George Herbert Walker Bush, who was then attending the private Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. A romance was sparked at the 1941 Christmas dance and continued mostly through letters.

She later called him her first love and said he was the only boy she ever kissed. She entered Smith College in 1943, but, as she told United Press International years later, ""didnt like to study very much. . . . The truth is, I just wasnt very interested. I was just interested in George.""

She withdrew from Smith in 1944 after their engagement was announced. Her fiance, a handsome Navy pilot, was serving in the South Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944, when his plane was hit by enemy fire. He was rescued in the water. They married on Jan. 6, 1945, while George was home on leave. He had named his bomber plane ""Barbara.""

After the war, she went with him to New Haven, Conn., where he graduated from Yale University, and then to West Texas.

Many years afterward, she told The Post that her early experiences in Texas helped toughen her for public life. ""When you become a couple, all grown up, nobodys son or daughter, nobodys shadow, you are you,"" she said. ""For me, it was a very healthy thing. I grew up after I left the shadow of my mother.""

In 1953, the Bush family was devastated by the prolonged suffering and eventual death of daughter Robin, whose full name was Pauline Robinson Bush. Decades later, Barbara Bush would still choke up when speaking of her.

""I was combing her hair and holding her hand,"" she told the ""Today"" show. ""I saw that little body, I saw her spirit go.""

Barbara was thrust into despair by the ordeal and its aftermath. But The Post reported that Robins death deepened Mrs. Bushs bond with her son George, who was 7 at the time. He would tell friends he could not go out to play because his mother needed him, and he worked hard to cheer her up - shaping, as it happened, his ebullient personality.

Mrs. Bush gradually regained her equilibrium. With her husband, she started a foundation that raised money for leukemia research and awareness. She also spent considerable time helping guide her son Neil through his struggles with dyslexia. She said her sons reading disorder contributed to her devotion to literacy as second lady and then as first lady.

George H.W. Bushs careers in the oil business and public service often kept him away from home, leaving Mrs. Bush as the authority figure. She drove the car pools and stuffed five kids in the car for the annual summertime cross-country trips to the family retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.

She acknowledged that once her youngest child left the house, she fell into depression. She attributed her feelings, at least in part, to the lack of purpose she felt as her children - and the womens movement - came of age. ""Suddenly womens lib had made me feel my life had been wasted,"" she told USA Today in 1989.

She said that her husband helped her overcome her doubts and that she also began to take satisfaction in seeing her children develop into self-sufficient adults, even if some - particularly the one who would become president - showed fiercely independent sides.

By his own admission, George W. Bush drank too much in his youth and gave his parents many headaches before a newfound religious fervor in his 40s changed his life. Mrs. Bush simply called her son ""a late bloomer.""

Neil, the fourth child, was a director of the Denver-based Silverado Savings & Loan and was enmeshed in its collapse in 1988, which cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.He and other directors settled the case, and Neil Bush paid a $50,000 fine.

Besides her husband, survivors include five children, George, Jeb, Marvin, who co-founded an investment firm, Neil Bush and Dorothy ""Doro"" Bush Koch, who has worked in fundraising and philanthropy; a brother; 17 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

  

Mrs. Bush generated a flash of controversy when Wellesley College, the womens school in Massachusetts, invited her to speak at its 1990 commencement. Some students protested, saying the first lady, who had dropped out of college to marry and who had risen to prominence through the accomplishments of her husband, did not represent the type of career woman the college sought to educate.

At the commencement, Mrs. Bush told the graduates to ""cherish your human connections: your relationships with family and friends."" She memorably added: ""Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as the presidents spouse, and I wish him well.""

She had abandoned some of the reserve she cultivated as first lady by the time her son was elected president in 2000. When George W. Bushs administration was criticized for its slow response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she told the public radio program ""Marketplace"" that the Gulf Coast evacuees being housed at Houstons Astrodome ""were underprivileged anyway, so this is working very well for them.""

A White House press secretary tried to play down the remark, saying Mrs. Bush was making a strictly ""personal observation.""

In her final years, Barbara Bush lived in the home she and her husband built in Houston and largely stayed out of the spotlight. In 2009, she sat for an interview with Fox News on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas.

""Well, it was a wonderful life that hes had and Ive shared,"" Mrs. Bush said wistfully, recalling her time with her husband in Washington and China and even the car that first took them to West Texas. ""Weve had a great life.""",17/04/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Broken Trust: How Henry Lyons cheated a Temple Terrace church and one of the world’s wealthiest charities,"TAMPA  Before he was sent to prison nearly 20 years ago, the Rev. Henry Lyons apologized for a litany of sins. Extortion and laundering of church funds. Hidden properties, secret mistresses and an opulent lifestyle that included luxury cars and a personal chef.

But the former St. Petersburg pastor who once presided over the nations largest black religious organization never said a word about Rochelle McCanns.

FOR PREVIOUS COVERAGE: For a history of Henry Lyons rise and fall from the pulpit, go to tampabay.com/henry-lyons.

McCanns is a convicted prostitute who rose to an administrative position at Lilly Endowment Inc., an Indianapolis-based philanthropy that is one of the worlds wealthiest charitable foundations.

In the 1990s, records show, Lyons secretly funneled thousands in National Baptist Convention U.S.A. money to McCanns, including $10,000 donated by the Anti-Defamation League for the rebuilding of black churches damaged by arson.

Authorities knew McCanns received the diverted money but she was never charged with a crime. Prosecutors and investigators say they were focused on bigger targets.

Now a Tampa Bay Times investigation finds the relationship between the two continued decades later in a new Lyons scheme, this one targeting Lillys generosity.

Interviews and records show McCanns and Lyons arranged to have more than $130,000 in Lilly money sent to New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Temple Terrace, which made Lyons pastor in 2004 after his release from prison. The stated purpose was to help finance youth programs and community service work. Records show most of the funds ended up in accounts controlled by Lyons.

McCanns, 70 and now retired, denies doing anything wrong. She says she never received a dime from Lyons, past or present.

""I dont have anything to do with Henry Lyons or his money, she told a reporter before abruptly ending a recent interview.

Lyons, 76, who was fired from New Salem last year, did not answer questions about his relationship with McCanns or about bank records that show Lilly money moving in and out of his accounts.

Warren Hope Dawson, his attorney, declined to discuss specifics. He said, however, that there was no contract or church bylaw that prohibited Lyons from opening personal accounts and depositing New Salem money in them.

""Rev. Lyons denies any wrongdoing in connection to the New Salem church,"" Dawson said. ""Any wrongdoing that was done in the past, he was punished for it, and he accepted his punishment like a man.""

Last summer, the FBI seized a computer and multiple boxes of financial records used by Lyons and his wife from New Salem offices. As is its practice, the FBI will not comment on investigations.

But McCanns acknowledged agents have contacted her. And more recently, church officials say agents have been questioning them. Several said they were asked if they would be willing to testify against Lyons.



Wynie Anderson was the secretary at New Salem for 19 years. When an invoice or donation arrived, Anderson was usually the first to know.

She made bank deposits and notarized property transactions. She scoured the Internet looking for ways to raise money for the church. One day in late 2009, she told the Times, Lyons called her into his office. He told her he had stumbled onto a new grant prospect and needed her help.

The Lilly Endowment of Indianapolis  created by members of the family that built Eli Lilly and Co., the giant pharmaceutical firm  had money the church could get, Anderson said Lyons told her. But there was a twist. Lyons would have to send money to get money.

""He says to me, This funding comes from this endowment where they pay pastors if the pastors give X amount of dollars,? Anderson said. ""I say really? He said, Yeah.?

Lilly says nothing like that has ever existed. But the organization does have an ""incentive for personal giving"" program open only to Lilly employees, who can apply for a 2-to-1 match of every dollar they donate to an outside charity. Employees must certify the donation is coming from them and not from outside individuals or organizations.

For months, Lyons mailed at least $1,500 to a contact at Lilly, Anderson told the Times. When a Lilly check arrived at the church, he told her where to deposit it. For her help with each transaction, she was typically given $300.

Occasionally, Anderson would talk by phone to a woman at Lilly who wanted to make sure the church had the forms it needed.

Her name, Anderson said, was Rochelle McCanns.



From 1975 until her retirement in 2015, McCanns held a number of administrative positions at the Lilly Endowment. The last was overseeing its matching gift program for employees.

The Lilly Endowment is one of the largest private foundations in the world, with more than $10 billion in assets. In a typical year, it awards hundreds of millions in grants, much of it to education and religion programs.

The matching gift program is designed to encourage employee giving.

Between 2009 and 2014, Lilly paid New Salems nonprofit arm  New Salem Ministries  $132,200 in matching grants. In each instance, McCanns signed a form certifying she had made the initial contribution personally, according to a statement by Clay Robbins, the Lilly Endowment chief executive.

At the time, the church charity provided food for the poor, child day care, an after-school program and other social services. It was supposed to receive $20,000 in 2009; $23,400 in 2010; $18,800 in 2011; $21,000 in 2012; $26,000 in 2013 and $24,000 in 2014.

Bank statements and church records show at least $94,000 was diverted into other accounts controlled by Lyons.

Most of it went to Regions Bank in Tampa. Lyons directed an 82-year-old deacon to start the new account, called the New Salem Missionary Baptist Church Benevolence Fund, on Feb. 11, 2013. Bank statements show the deacon opened it with $3,000 from church members tithes and donations.

That was the same day the U.S. Attorneys Office informed Lyons of its plans to audit his finances to ensure he was paying his legally required restitution for crimes committed while president of the National Baptist Convention. It was also the same day prosecutors filed a subpoena on BB&T bank, demanding records about Lyons checking and savings accounts there.

Until that time, New Salem kept its benevolence funds at SunTrust and PNC banks. They were small pots of money set aside to provide loans to church members in crisis.

The fund would range from as little as $100 to as much as a few thousand. Dispersals were capped at $300, with each case required to be approved by Lyons and one other church leader.

Between February 2013 and December 2014, $69,800 in Lilly matching money moved in and out of the account at Regions. The cycle of deposits and withdrawals was repeated 15 times, with checks from Lilly or McCanns coming in and money going out to Lyons or accounts he controlled.

Breach Ministries, a charity created by Lyons, received $42,100. Almost $15,000 went to Lyons directly while $10,700 was paid to National Trusted Partners, an organization founded by Lyons.

Church officials say the benevolence fund at Regions was created without their knowledge. They say they didnt learn of the Lilly checks until told by the Times.

The deacon has since left the church.

G.W. Stewart, treasurer for National Trusted Partners at the time of the transactions, told the Times he was unaware the organization had received thousands intended for New Salem Ministries. Lyons alone controlled the checkbook, he said, as well as related financial transactions. He insisted he was a treasurer in name only and never saw financial statements or held any real oversight power.

""One time Lyons brought the checkbook with him and I saw something that I couldnt understand, he told the Times. He said he asked Lyons to identify the recipient of a particular check.

""And he said, Well, I have some personal business mixed up with that. So dont worry about that,? Stewart said. ""I left it alone. After that I didnt ask any more questions. I figured if I dont know nothing about it then Im not involved.""

Most of the Lilly donations do not appear to have been disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by New Salem Ministries, as required by law.

Tax records show New Salem Ministries only informed the IRS of the money once, in 2011. And it apparently underreported the gift, claiming only to have received $6,000 that year when Lillys records show giving at more than three times that amount  $18,800.

Four other years went unreported.

Questions have also surfaced about the legitimacy of signatures used by Lyons and McCanns to acquire the Lilly funds.

Anderson, the former New Salem secretary, and Rufus Spencer, a former church president, told the FBI the handwriting was forged on some of the paperwork.

Lilly used the forms to guarantee all parties agreed with the terms. No money would be released without signatures. Anderson says that while she did sign forms at Lyons request, investigators produced one document that truly alarmed her.

""They had my name spelled wrong and my signature was wrong,"" Anderson said. ""They had Winnie Anderson and signed it Winnie. But my name is Wynie Anderson. So I told the agent, Nope. That is not mine.?""

Spencer, who maintains he knew nothing about the Lilly gifts, gave FBI agents several handwriting samples to prove his name and signature had been faked.

""I know that wasnt me. Everything in the form was neat. I mean its legible. But my handwriting isnt neat. You cant read my writing. I cant even read my writing,"" Spencer said. ""I just dont have good penmanship. But now Im glad I dont.""



So who is Rochelle McCanns? And what was her connection to Lyons?

Records and interviews tell the story of a woman who has had a difficult life, especially in her early years.

Born in Indianapolis, McCanns didnt know much about her father. Her mother, a hotel maid, died of breast cancer when McCanns was 14. She was living with foster parents when she became pregnant. She was 16 at the time.

She was able to earn a high school diploma through night classes, but by 1967, the 20-year-old was on her own, and soon, police records show, on Indianapolis streets trading sex for cash. She went by the name of Beverly Bell and police got to know her well.

Because of the age of the crimes and McCanns use of fake names and birthdates, her prostitution past isnt easily found. The Times pieced together her history through fingerprint records, court files from the late 1960s, prison records and interviews.

During an 18-month period from 1967 to early 1969, McCanns was arrested 56 times, according to Indianapolis police records. She was finally sentenced to two to five years in prison.

Not long after McCanns was paroled two years later, Charles G. Williams, a Lilly Endowment vice president, decided to give her a job, making her an Endowment receptionist. Its unknown whether he was aware of her criminal past.

He later promoted her to an assistant to the program officer working with black churches.

""All I knew was she had overcome some problems or some charges. I never knew what they were, said Charles Blair, a former Lilly program officer who remembers McCanns fondly. ""For whatever reason, they (Lilly) decided she was worth taking the risk. And they were correct. She was very good.

While McCanns was rising up the corporate ladder in Indiana, Lyons was firmly established as the fiery, charismatic pastor of St. Petersburgs Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church.

But he had his sights set on the presidency of the National Baptist Convention, which now claims about 30,000 congregations and more than 7 million members.

He had supporters in the Midwest and while campaigning in Indianapolis, Lyons met McCanns. The Rev. Melvin Girton, a retired Indianapolis pastor, is now a historian for the National Baptist Convention. He remembers watching an attraction develop between Lyons and McCanns, who was divorced and living alone.

Whenever local pastors arranged for Lyons to speak in town, Girton told the Times, she was there. Then Lyons started to show up in Indianapolis unannounced. A few times, Girton said he discovered Lyons and McCanns together at her apartment.

During the Conventions 1994 assembly in New Orleans, Lyons was announced the winner of the presidential vote  and McCanns was there. About a year later, Lyons sought Lilly financing for a prison ministry. For months, he sent checks to McCanns. State investigators later determined the money came from the Baptist Building Fund, a secret Convention bank account established by Lyons that prosecutors said he operated like a personal slush fund.

According to copies of checks, registers and ledgers obtained by the Times, McCanns received $8,000 from the fund in April 1996. The following month, Lyons sent another $3,000.

His biggest check  for $10,000  went out in November. Records show that money came from a $225,000 donation from the Anti-Defamation League of New York, a Jewish civil rights group. It was supposed to help repair black churches damaged by arson.

At the time, Lyons was living large. He flew first-class, bought multiple homes and showered female friends with gifts. Then his third wife, Deborah, discovered Lyons had purchased a house with another woman. She tried to burn down that $700,000 home in Tierra Verde.

Deborahs arrest led to a closer examination of Lyons lifestyle and business dealings. He was soon under arrest and convicted in state court of grand theft and racketeering. He later reached a plea agreement in federal court on tax evasion and bank fraud charges. He eventually served five years in prison.

In the state trial, there wasnt a focus on McCanns even though the case against Lyons was largely about his theft of church arson funds.

Limited money and manpower hampered how broadly Pinellas investigators could chase down leads, remembers William Loughery, a former Pinellas County assistant state attorney who worked on the case.

The Pinellas-Pasco State Attorneys Office knew McCanns was one of several recipients of the arson funds, investigative notes obtained by the Times show. But when an investigator couldnt reach her by phone or track down an accurate address, prosecutors dropped it. They believed her out-of-state status would have posed thorny legal challenges and that other aspects of the case had stronger potential. Still, Loughery hoped the bigger, better-resourced FBI would pursue the lead.

But former FBI special agent Neil V. Palenzuela, who led the Lyons investigation, thinks the FBI had a higher priority than McCanns. They were trying to determine whether Lyons disbursed the money to needy burned-out churches, as he claimed. Agents eventually found numerous pastors across the country who said they never received a dime.

""(She) probably didnt make our threshold, Palenzuela said about McCanns. ""There was so much to deal with. Thats why I think at some point we made a decision that were going with the most egregious transactions.

Many of Lyons acquaintances deserted him once he entered prison. But not McCanns.

Lyons was only authorized to call 10 people a year while incarcerated and McCanns was on the institutions approved list. He put her there every year of his five-year stint  a privilege not given to his wife, Deborah, prison records show.

He petitioned prison officials to add McCanns to a list of special visitors who could avoid a criminal background check, and then tried to get authorization for a Thanksgiving meeting.

When prison officials balked over a married Lyons seeing any woman who wasnt his wife or immediate family, he began describing McCanns in subsequent requests as his sister-in-law and aunt-in-law, according to Lyons prison file.

Meanwhile, friends said McCanns regard for Lyons was so high that she wouldnt allow guests to eat holiday meals until Lyons called from prison and blessed the food.



In a statement, Lilly would only confirm McCanns years of employment. Officials said employee privacy interests prevent them from providing anything else, including whether Lilly was aware of her criminal background.

""The matters that you describe are disturbing, and we would be deeply disappointed if it is proven that an employee broke our trust and misused philanthropic funds,"" wrote Robbins, Lillys chief executive. ""We are taking appropriate steps in response to the situation.

The decision to remove Lyons has left New Salem Missionary Baptist Church reeling. Some longtime members exited, feeling Lyons was treated unfairly. Others who stayed, like Rufus Spencer, have seesawed between anger and regret.

The churchs lofty dreams for New Salem Ministries have vanished.

Instead, New Salem Ministries became a source of angst and frustration, an insatiable money pit swallowing critical church resources year after year. It was finally shuttered last summer.

Tampa Bay Times,How to fight an opioid addiction,"(Editors note: This week alone, about 20 people in the Tampa Bay area will die after overdosing on opioids, according to state statistics and the law of averages. Among the culprits: heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone, methadone and morphine. Officials will classify the vast majority of cases as ""accidental,"" the but the real cause is the soaring addiction rate. As families here and elsewhere wrestle with this scourge, Kaiser Health News offers some practical advice on how to cope.)

Rule No. 1: Stay alive.

If you or a loved one wants to beat an opioid addiction, first make sure you have a handy supply of naloxone, a medication that can reverse an overdose and save your life.

""Friends and families need to keep naloxone with them,"" says Dr. David Kan, an addiction medicine specialist in Walnut Creek who is president of the California Society of Addiction Medicine. ""People using opioids should keep it with them, too.""

More than 42,200 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2016, victims of a crisis thats being fueled by the rise of a powerful synthetic opioid called fentanyl, which is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin. Rock stars Prince and Tom Petty had fentanyl in their systems when they died.

People can become addicted to opioids through long-term use, or misuse, of prescription painkillers. In most cases, that leads to heroin use, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

If youre ready to address your own addiction, or that of a loved one, know that you may not succeed  at first. You probably wont be able to do it without outside help or medications. And youll probably have to take those medications for years  or the rest of your life.

""Getting over a drug addiction is a process. There are going to be ups and downs,"" says Patt Denning, director of clinical services and training at the Center for Harm Reduction Therapy in San Francisco and Oakland. ""We need to hang with people while theyre struggling. It might take awhile.""

Thats why Denning and others suggest you start with having naloxone on hand, which can help you stay alive through the process.

Last year in San Francisco, about 1,200 potentially fatal overdoses were reversed by regular folks administering naloxone, not doctors, police or paramedics, Kan says.

Naloxone, which can be administered as a nasal spray or injection, is available without a prescription in more than 40 states, including Florida. It is also known as Narcan. Ask your pharmacy if it stocks the drug. Needle exchange programs also offer the medication at no charge, Denning says, as do some public health clinics.

Rehab alone doesnt work

People addicted to opioids face staggering relapse rates of 80 to 90 percent within 90 days if they try short-term rehab or detox programs that wean them off the drugs without assistance from medications, says Richard Rawson, a UCLA psychiatry professor emeritus.

Rawson warns that rehab can also increase the risk of an overdose, because your bodys tolerance to opioids is lower after you withdraw from them.

""If you leave rehab and take the same dose you used to take, youre not just going to get high, youre going to be dead,"" he says.

Instead of treating opioid addiction like a curable illness, he and other experts liken it to lifelong, chronic conditions such as diabetes that require ongoing management.

""This isnt going to be one visit. If you have an addictive disorder, this is going to be the rest of your life,"" says Dr. Stuart Gitlow, an addiction specialist in New York City who is past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

Chronic illnesses often require medication. Rawson and others point to two drugs in particular that may help break your addiction: buprenorphine and methadone.

There is some unwarranted stigma attached to these drugs, along with a belief that ""youre just exchanging one addiction for another,"" Kan says.

While these medications are actually opioids themselves, they control craving and withdrawal  and help prevent the compulsive and dangerous behavior often associated with addiction.

They also reduce your chances of an overdose, Rawson says. And they protect you from other risks that come with opioid addiction, such as exposure to blood-borne infections from sharing needles, including HIV and hepatitis C.

Essentially, the medications make you ""comfortable enough physically"" to confront the issues behind your addiction, from anxiety and depression to post-traumatic stress disorder, Denning says.

The federal government agrees.

""Abundant scientific data show that long-term use of maintenance medications successfully reduces substance use, risk of relapse and overdose, associated criminal behavior, and transmission of infectious disease, as well as helps patients return to a healthy, functional life,"" according to the Surgeon Generals 2016 report on addiction in America.

To obtain methadone, you must visit a clinic governed by state and federal rules.

""These clinics are not particularly patient-friendly. You have to go every day. You cant travel,"" Denning says. ""It takes over your life.""

Buprenorphine, on the other hand, can be obtained from doctors, including primary care physicians, who have undergone training and received federal approval.

""The beauty of buprenorphine is it can be prescribed like any medication out of a doctors office,"" Denning says.

To find a doctor who prescribes buprenorphine, go to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website at www.samhsa.gov and click on the ""Find Help & Treatment"" link from the home page. You can search by state and ZIP code.

Though you can receive care from your primary care physician, Gitlow recommends that you also consult with an addiction specialist.

Check the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatrys website at www.aaap.org and click on the ""Patient Resources"" tab on the home page.

After you start the medication

Once patients start one of the medications, its not clear how long they should stay on  a question that deserves further research, Rawson says.

""The longer people stay on treatment, the lower the death rate is and the more theyre able to function,"" he says.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Chronic pain sufferers plead for a nuanced approach to opioids (w/video)

Often patients face pressure from family members, who badger them to get off the medications even though it would be better for them to stay on them, Kan says.

""We dont say to patients who suffer from diabetes Have you changed your diet enough so you can get off insulin?"" he says.

Kan and other addiction specialists generally dont encourage medication treatment alone, no matter how long you stay on it. Pairing the medication with therapy or other support, including 12-step programs such as Narcotics Anonymous, can reduce relapse rates further, they say.

Al-Anon and Nar-Anon groups also can be helpful resources for families, Kan adds.

""12-step is something I encourage for everybody. I dont consider it a treatment, per se. Its like mutual support,"" he says.

When can cops shoot?

Several lawmakers and the family of a 22-year-old unarmed black man who was fatally shot by Sacramento police proposed Tuesday that California become the first state to significantly restrict when officers can open fire. The legislation would change the standard to ""necessary force."" That means police would be allowed to shoot only if ""there were no other reasonable alternatives"" to prevent imminent serious injury or death, said Lizzie Buchen of the ACLU, which is among the groups behind the measure. ""We need to ensure that our state policy governing the use of deadly force stresses the sanctity of human life and is only used when necessary,"" said assemblywoman Shirley Weber, a San Diego Democrat who introduced the bill. The goal is to encourage officers to defuse confrontations or use less deadly weapons, said co-author Democratic Assemblyman Kevin McCarty of Sacramento. Weber, who heads a public safety oversight committee, said she hopes the heavily publicized string of police shootings and mass protests over Stephon Clarks death will help pass the bill. Two Sacramento officers, reporting to calls of car break-ins, shot the 22-year-old in his grandparents back yard within seconds and without identifying themselves because they thought he had a gun. He had only a cellphone.

Impatient for wall, Trump wants military to secure Mexican border

Frustrated by slow action on his major campaign promise to build a ""big, beautiful wall,"" President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to use the military to secure the U.S.-Mexico border until his promised wall is built. Trump told reporters hes been discussing the idea with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. ""Were going to be doing things militarily. Until we can have a wall and proper security, were going to be guarding our border with the military,"" Trump said. It wasnt immediately clear exactly how the proposal would work or what kind of troops Trump wanted to deploy, and the Pentagon struggled to answer questions about the plan. But the White House later said Trump wanted to mobilize the National Guard. Federal law prohibits the use of active-duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S., unless specifically authorized by Congress. But over the past 12 years, presidents have twice sent National Guard troops to the border to bolster security and assist with surveillance and other support. The White House counsels office has been working on the idea for several weeks. Trump has previously suggested using the Pentagons budget to pay for building the wall, arguing it is a national security priority, despite strict rules that prohibit spending thats not authorized by Congress.

White House plans tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports: The Trump administration is recommending 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports to protest Beijings alleged theft of American technology. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has issued a list targeting 1,300 Chinese products, including industrial robots and telecommunications equipment. But the proposed tariffs wouldnt take effect before a public comment period ends May 11. American businesses worry the administrations moves will draw painful retaliatory sanctions.

DHS suspects cellphone spying: For the first time, the U.S. government has publicly acknowledged the existence in Washington of what appear to be rogue devices that foreign spies and criminals could be using to track individual cellphones and intercept calls and messages. In a letter to Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged that last year it identified suspected unauthorized cell-site simulators in the nations capital. The agency said it had not determined the type of devices in use or who might have been operating them. Nor did it say how many it detected or where. The agencys response suggests little has been done about such equipment.

Woman wounds 3 at YouTube, then fatally shoots self

A woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside, police and witnesses said. Officers and federal agents swarmed the companys suburban campus sandwiched between two interstates in the San Francisco Bay Area city of San Bruno. YouTube employee Dianna Arnspiger said she was on the buildings second floor when she heard gun shots, ran to a window and saw the shooter on a patio outside. She said the woman wore glasses and a scarf and was using a ""big huge pistol."" Zach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at Youtube, said he saw the shooter yelling, ""Come at me, or come get me."" Officers found the shooter with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound several minutes later, San Bruno police Chief Ed Barberini said. He said three other people had gunshot wounds and a fourth person suffered an ankle injury. YouTubes headquarters has more than a thousand engineers and other employees in several buildings. San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a 36-year-old man in critical condition, a 32-year-old woman in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman in fair condition.

Grindr changes policy on outside sharing of users HIV status

Grindr, a gay dating app, will stop sharing users HIV statuses with third parties. The policy change came over outcry after a BuzzFeed report Monday that said personal data was being passed to two outside vendors hired by Grindr to test the performance of its app. Apptimize and Localytics are fed user data that includes HIV statuses, GPS data, phone numbers and email addresses that, when combined, could expose someones private health information, researchers told BuzzFeed. On Monday, Grindr said it would never sell personally identifiable information to third parties. ""We understand the sensitivities around HIV status disclosure,"" said Scott Chen, Grindrs chief technology officer. The app offers users the option to list their HIV status and test dates, aimed at informing potential sexual partners. Grindr launched in 2009, years before Tinder, and helped pioneer a fast and location-specific approach to dating. Grindr has since expanded from a hookup app to a broader digital platform advocating for LGBTQ issues. Gay and bisexual mens HIV status in particular remains highly sensitive because of discrimination and stigma.

Tampa Bay Times,Trump order would ban most transgender troops from serving,"Associated Press

PALM BEACH  President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under ""limited circumstances,"" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.

The White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria""  those who may require substantial medical treatment  ""presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.""

Trump surprised the Pentagons leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.

""This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards  including those regarding the use of medical drugs  equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Transgender people can enlist in military

The new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, ""No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.""

The Human Rights Campaign, the nations largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing ""anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.""

""There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,"" said HRC President Chad Griffin.

Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy ""effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.""

Trump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.

Earlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.

The Justice Department said in a statement late Friday that it would defend the Pentagons authority to ""implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation"" and would ask the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions.

The issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. Its unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trumps decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.

Under guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified theyve been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obamas administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.",24/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Joe Redner hopes to be allowed to grow his own cannabis as early as next week,"Joe Redner, Tampas outspoken strip club owner and cancer patient, is hoping hell be able to legally grow his own marijuana plants soon.

Redner, 77, made his case against the Florida Department of Health in a Tallahassee courtroom Wednesday on why he has a constitutional right to grow his own marijuana plants. Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers is expected to rule on the case next week.

""We made our presentation and then the department had about 13 minutes of gobbledygook,"" Redner said of the short trial during a phone interview with the Tampa Bay Times Wednesday. ""I feel confident that the case is for us, not against us.""

Redner, who owns the Mons Venus strip club in Tampa, is a registered medical marijuana patient in Florida and uses cannabis products to treat conditions related to his stage-four lung cancer. He filed the lawsuit last summer, less than two weeks after lawmakers put in place new laws governing the growing, manufacturing and selling of medical marijuana.

It claims the state is not following the will of the public, which voted overwhelmingly in 2016 for a constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana.

In January, the same judge denied a motion by the Florida Department of Health to dismiss Redners case. The judge also denied Redners motion for an emergency temporary injunction, which would have allowed him to grow marijuana plants during the court process, but described Redners plea in the case as ""constitutional in nature,"" which allowed it to move forward.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Joe Redner wins an early round in his legal fight to grow his own marijuana

Under state Health Department rules, Floridians are barred from growing cannabis for their personal use, including those who are legally registered as medical marijuana patients. Redners lawsuit challenged those rules based on how the state Constitution, as amended by voters, defines marijuana.

The suit claims that the definition includes ""all parts of the plant."" Redner said he wants to grow his own plants because he says he has no idea what hes getting from the states licensed growers and distributors.

The Health Department argued in court Wednesday that Redners case could open the door to more challenges over the amendments language, if the judge rules in favor of him.

""What the plaintiff and this court are about to do, if you hold that individual medical users have immunity to grow their own marijuana, you may ultimately cause the entire medical marijuana constitutional amendment to be nullified and stricken from the Florida Constitution,"" said Jason Gonzalez, an attorney with the Shutts & Bowen firm, who represented the Department of Health during trial Wednesday. ""I dont think this is what you are intending to do, but it is what binding Florida Supreme Court precedent provides.""

Gonzalez said that the ballot summary voters read when voting on Amendment 2 was never intended to allow individuals to grow their own marijuana.

""The ballot summary informed the voters that only registered and regulated centers would be given immunity for growing marijuana,"" he said. ""This is significant, if your final ruling is consistent with your prior ruling that there is a Constitutional right for individuals to cultivate and process marijuana.""

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Are Florida doctors prepared to treat patients with medical marijuana?

Lawmakers have limited the selling and growing of marijuana to 13 companies. That number could grow based on demand and the number of registered patients in the state. Currently, the licensed companies can sell cannabis pills, oils, edibles and ""vape"" pens with a doctors approval, but the law bans smoking.

More than 70 percent of voters in 2016 approved Amendment 2, expanding who can legally use medical marijuana in Florida from just the terminally ill and some other patients with epilepsy and cancer, to those with other debilitating conditions such as glaucoma, HIV/AIDS and post traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions. Lawmakers struggled with how to implement the expansion, which is expected to become a $1 billion industry in Florida within the next three years.

Tampa Bay Times,Indian doctors amputated a man’s leg. Then it was used as a pillow.,"This week, two Indian doctors joined the ignoble ranks of the surgeon who trash-talked about her patient while he was under anesthesia and the one who forgot to remove a knife blade from a patients brain.

The Indian doctors and two nurses were suspended after a patients severed leg was used to prop up his head, according to hospital officials. The incident came to light after images and video showing the patient, identified as 28-year-old Ghanshyam, on a stretcher with his amputated limb as a headrest began to circulate.

Ghanshyam had been driving a school bus full of children when a herd of cattle appeared on the road. He swerved to avoid the animals and lost control of the bus, which flipped.

He was rushed to the hospital. When his relatives came to visit, they told local news outlets, they were horrified to find out that his leg was being used as a headrest.

His relatives implored hospital staff to provide a pillow. Their entreaties were ignored. ""I repeatedly asked the doctors to intervene but they refused,"" Janaki Prasad, a relative, told NDTV. Eventually, she said, she went to the market to buy Ghanshyam a pillow. Things got so bad that the patients family transferred him to a private hospital, according to the Times of India.

The government-run hospital in Uttar Pradesh where Ghanshyam was initially taken promised ""strict action"" against those responsible for the headrest incident.

""We have set up a four-member committee to find out who put the severed leg under the patients head,"" administrator Sadhna Kaushik told Agence France-Presse.

According to the Press Trust of India, Kaushik said the patient was given ""immediate"" medical attention. ""The doctor looked for something to raise his head. The patients attendant used the leg,"" she told PTI.

The incident highlights Indias struggle to provide adequate medical care. The countrys state-run hospitals are often ill-equipped, severely underfunded and stretched way too thin, according to AFP. This is especially true in Uttar Pradesh, one of Indias poorest states and home to 200 million people. Last year, dozens of children died at a government hospital in the region because of severe oxygen shortages. And just last month, an unlicensed doctor was arrested for allegedly infecting at least 46 people with HIV by reusing a syringe.",13/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Miami VA investigation finds discrepancies in HIV tests for veterans,"MIAMI  At least eight military veterans who were tested for HIV at the Miami VA Medical Center received a different result when they were screened for a second time by an outside lab  a discrepancy discovered only after an employee at the Miami facility complained to outside agencies and the White House that local managers were ignoring his concerns, according to an independent federal investigator.

The Department of Veterans Affairs investigated the complaints and said it was unable to substantiate the employees claims after a four-day visit to the Miami VAMC in October 2016.

On Wednesday the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative agency, called the VAs findings ""unreasonable"" and expressed ""incredulity"" that the Miami VAMC complied with new HIV testing policy only after the employee complained to outside agencies.

In a letter to President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner said VA investigators were unable to substantiate the claims because they loosely interpreted the deadline for the Miami VAMC to comply with the new HIV testing policy.

Kerner added that Miami VAMC officials failed to respond to concerns raised by the employee, Roman Miguel, a lab director, until after Miguel complained to the OSC in May 2016 and hand-delivered a notice to Miami VAMC Director Paul Russo on June 30, 2016.

""I am incredulous that compliance with Directive 1113 (the policy) and implementation of fourth generation HIV testing occurred only after Mr. Miguels disclosures and OSCs intercession,"" Kerner wrote in the letter.

Kerner noted that the OSC also asked VA Secretary David Shulkin to report on whether all of the agencys medical facilities around the country were using the latest HIV testing procedures as required by the 2015 policy.

Shane Suzuki, public affairs officer for the Miami VA Healthcare System, which oversees the medical center, said administrators ""strongly disagree"" with the OSCs allegations.

""As VA mentioned in its formal response provided to the OSC in January 2017, we did not substantiate any of the allegations; rather, VA confirmed compliance with VA and CDC recommendations and did not validate a public health risk,"" Suzuki said in a written statement. ""A comprehensive review of patients revealed they were tested under the appropriate CDC-approved alternative HIV testing procedures pending the receipt and installation of new laboratory equipment.""

The new HIV testing policy, known as Directive 1113, was implemented in May 2015 and involves general processes and programs for HIV testing as part of the VAs routine medical care. It includes guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for recommended and alternate testing sequences that updated the standard used since 1987.

Each VA medical facility is required to establish a written testing policy, and to follow requirements and processes for obtaining oral consent for HIV testing. The policy also details procedures for performing HIV tests and establishes timely notification of results in order to link newly diagnosed patients with the appropriate medical care.

But the VAs investigation identified eight veterans whose HIV test results from outside labs differed from the Miami VAMCs test results  including one patient who was deemed ""high risk"" for HIV and tested positive for the virus after followup screening.

In a second case, the Miami VAMC tried at least five times between June and December 2016 to contact a veteran with differing HIV test results. Eventually, the veteran returned for repeat screening and tested positive for HIV. The remaining six veterans with differing results returned to the Miami VAMC for retesting and were negative.

Its unclear how many HIV tests from the Miami VAMC were sent to an outside lab. But the VAs investigative report notes that the eight cases identified were produced by the Miami VAMC in response to the agencys request for all differing test results from Oct. 1, 2015, to Oct. 11, 2016.

Reached by phone on Wednesday, Miguel said he was unaware of the OSCs letter to the president and unprepared to comment. But he added that Miami VAMC administrators had taken steps to ensure the integrity of the facilitys HIV testing process.

""Im happy that this came out,"" Miguel said, ""because its for the best of the patient. Thats what we want to do here. We try to give the patient what they need.""",11/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Once silent, Stormy Daniels speaks loudly with lawsuit targeting Trump","More than 16 months ago, Stormy Daniels signed a confidentiality agreement that prohibited her from discussing her alleged affair with Donald Trump. Or his business. Or his children. Or his ""alleged children.""

Under the agreement, Daniels couldnt even keep a copy of the agreement. The penalty for defying these constraints? One million dollars each time.

That was then.

Now, the porn star is trying to rewrite the script. She hired an aggressive new lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who won a $454 million medical fraud verdict last year, the largest in the state of California in 2017. She took the president of the United States to court, declaring that the ""hush agreement"" under which she was paid $130,000 is void because it lacks Trumps signature.

Read More: Stormy at the strip club: A porn star cashes in on presidential connection

Possibly in defiance of a secret gag order, Daniels on Thursday gave a yet-to-be-aired interview to CBS News ""60 Minutes."" She spoke with a reporter for a story published by Rolling Stone on Friday under a headline calling her ""the Hero America Needs."" Shes lately been sassy on Twitter, mocking critics and correcting their misspellings.

With each new headline, her marketability surges.

""Look how Stormy is controlling the narrative now,"" said Karen Tynan, a lawyer based in the San Francisco area with clients in the porn industry. ""The allegedly most powerful man in the world is dancing to the tune played by Stormy.""

Those who know Daniels, 38, say they arent surprised. She is viewed as ambitious and resilient in the porn industry, where she rose from actress to director of dozens of films. In 2016, she won industry awards for ""Wanted,"" a three-hour western that she wrote, directed and starred in.

""She did a lot of things that most porn stars dont do,"" said Kevin Blatt, a broker of celebrity sex tapes. ""They dont graduate to that point of directing and taking control of their own careers. Theyre usually manipulated and exploited, chewed up and spit out.""

Daniels herself described her role in the porn world earlier this week, in a podcast hosted by erotic photographer Holly Randall. ""Ive written and directed all of my own movies for the last 10 years because I am a control freak,"" Daniels said. ""Or is it because, if you want something done right, you do it yourself? Or is it because I wanted to get paid double for the day? The correct answer is D, all of the above.""

That assertiveness contrasts with the silence that was required of Daniels in the deal she was negotiating in late 2016 with Trumps attorney, Michael Cohen.

""She was kind of in a predicament,"" said Slate editor Jacob Weisberg, who spoke with her during that time. ""There was a deal being worked out in which she could get money, which she wanted, but it wasnt working out as she expected, and she didnt know who to trust or what to do.""

What she decided to do, days before the 2016 election, was take the deal.

Cohen said Friday that the funds for the $130,000 payment came from his own home equity line of credit, a claim first reported by ABC News. Mortgage records show Cohen opened a line of credit for up to $500,000 in February of that year on his Manhattan condo.

The agreement names four people Daniels said she had told about the alleged affair: representative Gina Rodriguez, friend Keith Munyan, ex-husband Mike Mosney and porn actress Angel Ryan. Ryan, who goes by the stage name Jessica Drake, accused Trump before the election of forcibly kissing her and two friends a decade earlier, during the same Lake Tahoe golf tournament where he met Daniels.

Trump has denied misconduct with women, and his campaign called Drakes allegations ""totally false and ridiculous.""

The deal remained secret for more than a year. It leaked on Jan. 12, in a story published by the Wall Street Journal.

Soon, Daniels was speaking out, though coyly at first.

""You cant say whether you have a nondisclosure agreement,"" observed late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel during a Jan. 30 interview in which Daniels gave up little information. ""But if you didnt have a nondisclosure agreement, you most certainly could say, I dont have a nondisclosure agreement, yes?"" he asked.

""Youre so smart, Jimmy!"" Daniels responded.

The agreement calls for binding and confidential arbitration in the event of a dispute. (Despite its language, there has been no credible claim of Trump fathering children beyond the five he is known to have.)

On Feb. 27, Cohen enacted that provision. Within hours, the arbitrator issued a temporary restraining order barring Daniels from talking about the deal, catching her by surprise, Avenatti said.

On Tuesday, Daniels forced the matter fully into the public domain with the lawsuit she and Avenatti filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Though she has never suggested her relationship with Trump was anything other than consensual, the lawsuit links Daniels to the parade of women who accused him of sexual misconduct in the weeks before the 2016 election, motivated to speak out by revelations that he once bragged about groping women.

""Mr. Cohen is proceeding in a private arbitration hidden from public view in an effort to further hide from the public the true circumstances of what happened,"" Avenatti said in an interview.

Cohen said in January that Trump denied having had an affair with Daniels. He later acknowledged facilitating the payment. On Friday, citing language in the contract, he said Trumps signature was not required.

""I believe Mr. Avenattis actions and behavior has been both reckless and imprudent as it opens Ms. Clifford to substantial monetary liability, which I intend to pursue,"" Cohen said Friday, using Daniels given name. ""I question whether Mr. Avenatti has weighed his desire for 15 minutes of fame versus his clients welfare. Time will ultimately prove that I am right.""

Avenatti has become a brash spokesman for Daniels cause, slinging rapid-fire broadsides in a media blitz that entered its third day on Friday. His website touts his media savvy, saying ""most lawyers falter and under-utilize"" connections with the press.

The arguments he advances play into the new awareness, heightened by the #MeToo movement, of the ways powerful men have exploited women for decades. Increasingly, nondisclosure agreements and confidential arbitration have kept these matters private long after they are settled.

In the tense back-and-forth with Cohen before the election, Daniels was represented by Keith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer who built a business around celebrity news - often by brokering deals to keep it out of the public eye. He represented the ex-girlfriend of actor Verne Troyer, best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers movie series, in a lawsuit over a leaked sex tape. Another client was a woman who had been fired from the Betty Ford Clinic for disclosing confidential information about actress Lindsay Lohan.

In recent weeks, as scrutiny of her alleged relationship with Trump mounted, Daniels hired Avenatti, a lawyer whose practice has included cases ranging from wrongful death and negligence to complex class-action lawsuits.

""I retained Michael because I needed a top notch attorney with a proven track record who would listen and put my interests first; who is fearless, really smart, articulate and knows how to deal with the media,"" Daniels said in a statement provided by Avenatti. ""He has proven to be all of these things.""

Its not the first time Avenatti has sued Trump: He was on the legal team that in 2005 represented Mark Bethea, who accused Trump and television producer Mark Burnett of stealing his idea for the reality show that became ""The Apprentice."" The case was settled the following year on terms that were not disclosed.

Last year, Avenatti won the $454 million judgment against multinational paper company Kimberly-Clark and medical manufacturer Halyard Health over the companies claims that their surgical gowns were impermeable to serious diseases, such as Ebola and HIV.

""Michael is a very tenacious lawyer,"" said Bruce Broillet, a Santa Monica-based lawyer who has worked closely with Avenatti, noting that he graduated first in his law school class at George Washington University.

The highly visible approach taken by Avenatti and Daniels has caused her popularity to surge.

Each time Daniels has been in the news for her alleged affair with Trump - when she appeared on Kimmels show, when Cohen admitted arranging the $130,000 payment, and most recently when she sued the president - searches for her name on Pornhub.com have spiked, according to an analysis by the site.

After the story about the payment broke, searches for her name skyrocketed from a daily average of 2,500 to more than 2 million searches in five days.

Her fee for appearing at a Las Vegas strip club called Little Darlings in late January was unusually high, said manager Ron Nady, though he would not disclose it. ""She was the hottest thing on the planet,"" he said.

Daniels is from Louisiana, where she once explored a run for U.S. Senate. She lives near Dallas with her husband and their 7-year-old daughter, who is aware her mother makes movies that are not for children.

Daniels is also a serious equestrian, said Packy McGaughan, a Maryland-based horse trainer who first met her at a 2016 equestrian event, one that included Olympic riders. The porn stars presence can be a distraction when he is teaching children and their parents spot her, McGaughan acknowledged.

""The mothers ask, Is that Stormy Daniels? Errr, um. "" he said. ""And the fathers go Oooh. ""

McGaughan said he doesnt think Daniels will shy away from controversy. ""This is an extreme sport,"" he said. ""You have to be a risk taker in all aspect of your life. Thats her personality.""

Daniels determination has become a point of pride among sex workers and others in the industry who are tackling issues such as human trafficking and who have long felt marginalized.

""Weve never had a run-in with the president,"" said Brian Gross, a publicist who has clients in the porn industry. ""Nothing like this.""

As recently as this week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed the notion that Trump had approved a payment to Daniels. ""None of these allegations are true,"" she said.

In the recent podcast interview, Daniels said she was looking forward to sharing her story on her terms.

""Eventually, hopefully Ill be able to tell my side,"" she said. ""Not for any sort of gain other than I want to be able to defend myself. Thats the worst part, is that at this moment I cant defend myself.

""Its incredibly frustrating,"" she added, ""especially for somebody like me, who has no problem usually defending herself.""

The host, Randall, interjected: ""Yes, you arent somebody to keep your mouth shut.""

Daniels: ""My name is Stormy for a reason!""

Tampa Bay Times,'Pharma Bro' sentenced to 7 years prison,"NEW YORK — Martin Shrkeli, the smirking ""Pharma Bro"" vilified for jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug, was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison for defrauding investors in two failed hedge funds.

The self-promoting pharmaceutical executive notorious for trolling critics online was convicted in a securities fraud case last year unconnected to the price increase dispute.

Shkreli, his cocky persona nowhere to be found, cried as he told U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto he made many mistakes and apologized to investors.

""I want the people who came here today to support me to understand one thing, the only person to blame for me being here today is me,"" he said. ""I took down Martin Shkreli.""

He said that he hopes to make amends and learn from his mistakes and apologized to his investors.

""I am terribly sorry I lost your trust,"" he said. ""You deserve far better.""

Prosecutors argued that the 34-year-old was a master manipulator who conned wealthy investors and deserved 15 years in prison. His lawyers said he was a misunderstood eccentric who used unconventional means to make those same investors even wealthier, and deserved 18 months or less in prison.

The judge insisted that the punishment was not about Shkreli's online antics or raising the cost of the drug.

""This case is not about Mr. Shkreli's self-cultivated public persona ... nor his controversial statements about politics or culture,"" the judge said, calling his crimes serious.

He was also fined $75,000 and received credit for the roughly six months he has been in prison.

The judge ruled earlier this week that Shkreli would have to forfeit more than $7.3 million in a brokerage account and personal assets including his one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album that he boasted he bought for $2 million. The judge said the property would not be seized until Shkreli had a chance to appeal.

Attorney Benjamin Brafman told Matsumoto Friday that he sometimes wants to hug Shkreli and sometimes wants to punch him in the face , but he said his outspokenness shouldn't be held against him.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis said Shkreli deserved the stiffer sentence not because he is ""the most hated man in America,"" but because he is a criminal convicted of serious fraud. She said the judge had to consider his history and said he has ""no respect whatsoever"" for the law, or the court proceedings.

""I also want to make clear that Mr. Shkreli is not a child,"" Kasulis said. ""He's not a teenager who just needs some mentoring. He is a man who needs to take responsibility for his actions.""

Unapologetic from the beginning, when he was roundly publicly criticized for defending the 5,000 percent price increase of Daraprim, a previously cheap drug used to treat HIV, Shkreli seemed to drift through his criminal case as if it was one big joke.

After his arrest in December 2015, he taunted prosecutors, got kicked off of Twitter for harassing a female journalist, heckled Clinton from the sidewalk outside her daughter's home, gave speeches with the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and spent countless hours livestreaming himself in his apartment.

He was tight-lipped when faced with a barrage of questions about the price hike from members of Congress a couple of months later, citing his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. After the hearing, he tweeted that the lawmakers were ""imbeciles.""

Shkreli insisted he was being persecuted by prosecutors for being outspoken and confidently predicted after his conviction that he was unlikely to be sentenced to jail.

Things abruptly changed, though, last fall after he jokingly offered his online followers a $5,000 bounty to anyone who could get a lock of Hillary Clinton's hair. The judge revoked his bail and threw him in jail, a decision that she defended Friday.

That didn't tame Shkreli completely. He corresponded with journalists, ridiculing the personal appearance of one female reporter who asked him for an interview.

Before sentencing him, the judge said that it was up to Congress to fix the issue of the HIV price-hike. And she spoke about how his family and friends ""state, almost universally, that he is kind and misunderstood"" and willing to help others in need.

She said it was clear he is a ""tremendously gifted individual who has the capacity for kindness.""

She quoted from letters talking about generous acts like counseling a rape victim, teaching inmates math and chess, and funding family members.

The defense had asked the judge to consider the letters in its case for leniency, including professionals he worked with who vouched for his credentials as a self-made contributor to pharmaceutical advances.

Other testimonials were as quirky as the defendant himself. One woman described how she became an avid follower of Shkreli's social media commentary about science, the pharmaceutical industry, but mostly, about himself. She suggested that those who were annoyed by it were missing the point.

""I really appreciate the social media output, which I see on par with some form of performance art,"" she wrote.

Another supporter said Shkreli's soft side was demonstrated when he adopted a cat from a shelter — named Trashy — that became a fixture on his livestreams. Another letter was from a man who said he met Shkreli while driving a cab and expressed his appreciation at how he ended up giving him an internship at one of his drug companies.

In court filings, prosecutors argued that Shkreli's remorse about misleading his investors was not to be believed.

""At its core, this case is about Shkreli's deception of people who trusted him,"" they wrote.",09/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Bill to expand Miami-Dade needle exchange program will not pass this year, sponsor says","A bill that would have expanded Miami-Dade's needle exchange program to other counties will not pass this year despite a late compromise to limit its scope to just Broward and Palm Beach, its sponsor said.

HB 579/SB 800 would have allowed needle exchange programs to operate in the rest of South Florida, after the Legislature approved a five-year pilot program in Miami-Dade in 2016. The current program, run by the University of Miami, exchanges needles to cut down on the spread of HIV, hepatitis C and other blood-borne diseases among drug users. It also distributes overdose reversing drugs and offers access to substance abuse counseling.

Though the legislation passed the Senate and its final House committee, Rep. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, said House leadership does not plan to take the bill up on the floor, dooming its chances for passage. ""[Senate sponsor Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens] and I are upset, but committed to bringing this back next year,"" he said.

The bill initially called for allowing such needle exchange programs to expand statewide — operating a needle exchange outside Miami-Dade is currently not legal in Florida. But the Florida Sheriffs Association objected to the language after it reached the Senate floor, saying the bill should give law enforcement input in approving the programs.

That prompted Jones and Braynon to limit the expansion to just Broward and Palm Beach, which had officials who had already expressed interest in allowing needle exchanges to operate in their counties. But the compromise was not enough to prompt House leaders to agree to take up the bill, Jones said.

Hansel Tookes, the University of Miami medical professor who spearheads the program and was the pilot program's chief advocate, said he had already started having conversations in both counties to expand the existing program.

""This is not innovation. This is used everywhere,"" Tookes said. ""They're saying we're not deserving of a program that's going to save lives in that part of the state.""",09/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Venezuela faces a terrible new crisis: A critical shortage of blood,"CARACAS, Venezuela  In Venezuela, getting sick has never been more deadly.

Medicines from antibiotics to chemotherapy drugs have become increasingly scarce here in recent years. Public hospitals ask patients families to supply bed sheets and syringes. HIV patients have gone months without their drugs, and transplant patients have died without the immunosuppressants they need after surgery.

But the country is now experiencing a crisis in one of the most basic medical necessities: blood.

Lower oil prices and populist policies championed by the late Hugo Chávez and continued by his successor, President Nicolás Maduro, have plunged Venezuela into a spiraling economic emergency. The health system, which is also plagued by mismanagement and corruption, is crumbling.

Late last year, the situation turned so dire that blood for transfusions and surgeries was in critically short in supply at public hospitals. In January and February, medical workers say, the scarcity paralyzed most public blood banks, forcing patients to wait for urgent procedures and prompting doctors to advise families to try to acquire processed blood from private clinics.

The problem, according to doctors, is not so much a lack of donors as a shortage of the seven reagents that test donated blood for infections. Those reagents, which the Health Ministry and the Institute of Social Security import to distribute to public institutions here, are priced in dollars, making them expensive in the local currency, the near-worthless bolivar.

Without the reagents, blood cant be used.

On a morning in late February, Roselvia Escobar showed up at José Manuel de los Ríos, the public childrens hospital in Caracas, to beg for help finding blood for her 22-year-old son, Cesar, who needs three transfusions a month.

Cesar was diagnosed at birth with thalassemia, a blood disease. If he doesnt get the transfusions, his heart or nervous system could fail and his bones could become deformed. The family was unable to secure blood from December till February, when they got just one unit.

""Hes in bed, drowsy, inactive and terrified,"" Escobar, said. ""The right to live doesnt exist in Venezuela. You just pray to God your loved one doesnt die.""

Last week, Venezuelan patients received rare good news  a nearly two-month supply of reagents arrived at most public hospitals, purchased by the Health Ministry and the Institute of Social Security from laboratories and organizations abroad. The Pan American Health Organization said that a separate, donated batch will be sent to the country in the coming weeks and should last an additional month.

But doctors call those deliveries short-term solutions to a long-term problem. Facing uncertainty, many patients families have resorted to buying processed blood from private clinics, which acquire reagents from laboratories here that import them at black-market dollar rates. The official rate is largely inaccessible to private companies.

Carlos Maldonado, 40, bought blood from a private clinic for his father, who was admitted to Caracas University Hospital after being diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in January. It cost Maldonado nearly two months worth of wages.

""Thank God we could afford it,"" he said. ""We all hope he wont need more transfusions.""

But not all private clinics are selling blood. Some reserve their reagents exclusively for their own patients, unless public blood banks call directly and offer other scarce products in exchange for them.

In any case, in a country where 87 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, most families cant afford to pay what the clinics charge for usable blood. The Health Ministry and the Institute of Social Security did not respond to a request for comment.

""Its an unimaginable situation,"" said Maribel Melendez, secretary general of the Venezuelan Society of Hematologists, which represents most public blood banks nationwide. At the worst point in the shortages  mid-December to late February  70 percent of banks had no usable blood, she said.

For some patients forced to wait as their families and doctors scramble to get them a supply, the blood has arrived too late.

In mid February, a teenager caught in a gunfight died at the Domingo Luciani Hospital in Caracas because no blood was available. Six other patients died in the hospital this year for the same reason, according to a hematologist there who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government reprisals. The hospital had no blood reserves from December to March.",08/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Where’s my invite?’: 2,600 members of the public to attend Prince Harry and Meghan’s wedding","LONDON  Prince Harry and his fiancee, the American actor Megan Markle, announced Friday that they would invite members of public to their May wedding.

Well, not exactly to the wedding-wedding. But very close. Outside.

Kensington Palace announced that the hoi polloi (vetted, naturally) will be invited inside the walls of Windsor Castle  on the grounds if you will  to get a close-up look at the couple and their celebrity and royal guests as they enter and exit St. Georges Chapel, where the nuptial knot will be tied.

These lucky few  well, not exactly few, about 2,640 people  will represent the public at the nuptials.

But these folk will not be your random yobs brought in to gawp. No, no.

They will be selected and special people.

The palace broke it down: The largest contingent will be 1,200 members of the public ""from every corner of the United Kingdom"" nominated by nine regional Lord Lieutenant offices.

So hold off buying your airplane tickets.

""The couple has asked that the people chosen are from a broad range of backgrounds and ages, including young people who have shown strong leadership, and those who have served their communities,"" a palace spokesman said.

So, strong leaders.

The couple will also invite 530 members of staff from the Royal Household and Crown Estate, and 610 people from ""the Windsor Castle community.""

So, the neighbors.

""Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have said they want their wedding day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too,"" a palace spokesman said. ""This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters and values of the bride and groom.""

Also on the list: 100 pupils from two local schools, the Royal School and St. Georges School, ""both of which have a strong affiliation with the Windsor Castle community,"" the Telegraph newspaper reports.

So, well-scrubbed kids.

And finally, 200 people from charities supported by Prince Harry and his bride to be, the very popular Markle.

The Telegraph informs us these ""are likely to include the stars and staff from the Invictus Games, veterans, mental health charities, HIV awareness campaigns and seriously ill children.""

The Invictus Games are a sporting event that sees wounded, injured or sick soldiers compete  similar to the Warrior Games staged in the United States.",02/03/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Column: What you can do to help solve the opioid crisis,"wo million Americans are addicted to opioids, 64,000 died from overdoses in 2016, and the costs to our nation are topping $1 trillion. The opioid epidemic is, as President Donald Trump has declared, truly a national emergency.

But whats to be done?

Last week at the St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs, we were part of a panel entitled ""How did we get hooked? The opioid pandemic and what to do about it."" Experts in medicine, psychiatry, law and public health discussed the origins of the epidemic and possible solutions. Many in the audience had been touched by this crisis, but few felt sufficiently armed with facts on which to act to do something about it.

Here are some facts, in response to their questions:

Opioids are a class of drugs, including those derived from opium and those manufactured synthetically, that act on opioid receptors in the brain. Important in the relief of acute and end-of-life pain, they also act on the reward system in the brain, making them powerfully addictive. The current epidemic is not the first; there have been opium-related epidemics in the United States following the Civil War and famously in China following the ""opium wars.""

The current epidemic has been fueled by a significant change in prescribing practices of synthetic opioids, the influx of cheaper forms of heroin and the extremely potent derivatives fentanyl and carfentanyl. Also different are the socioeconomic circumstances that contribute to addiction, mental and physical co-morbidities of addiction, and the conflation of addiction as disease with addiction as criminal behavior.

A situation this complicated demands a comprehensive approach and, thankfully, experts in health care, behavioral health, law enforcement, community development, media, research and policy are coming together to better understand the many factors that created the current situation in the hopes of unraveling it.

It is clear that this unraveling needs to address both the supply of and the demand for these substances, as well as evidence-based treatments and harm reduction strategies. Along with a continuum of prevention  a hallmark of the public health approach  we must consider minimizing initial use, reducing addiction, increasing recovery, and preventing premature death and disease associated with opioid use.

As these efforts accelerate, as individuals we need not wait. Each of us can take steps today to contribute to solving this crisis.

1. If you are prescribed opioids following an acute injury or surgery, make sure you understand exactly how they are to be taken and how quickly you can stop taking them. Keep them in their original bottle and locked up.

2. If you have leftover opioids, get rid of them immediately. Most pharmacies have a drop box for unused medications; Walmart offers a free method called DisposeRx that they now dispense with all opioid prescriptions. Alternatively, you can mix the pills into used kitty litter or coffee grounds and dispose of them with your trash. Do not flush them down the toilet or put them down the drain.

3. If you experience chronic pain, ask your provider to discuss any and all alternatives available. Many options, including physical therapy, acupuncture and others, may provide long-term relief without the use of opioids.

4. Let your voice be heard. Ask your congressional representatives to reconsider direct to consumer marketing of pharmaceuticals, to recognize addiction as a chronic illness and not a moral failing, to loosen insurance restrictions on proven treatments for opioid addiction, to support needle exchange and safe injection sites to prevent premature death and new cases of HIV and hepatitis C, and to equip law enforcement officers with Narcan, the overdose reversing drug.

We must continue to educate ourselves and others to understand the totality of this crisis, the many factors that have contributed to it and the many ways needed to reverse it. Together, we can make a difference in our health and the quality of our lives.

Tampa Bay Times,Gay doctor takes a drug to prevent HIV. Then he couldn’t get disability insurance,"Three years ago, Dr. Philip J. Cheng, a urology resident at Harvards Brigham and Womens Hospital, nicked himself while preparing an HIV-positive patient for surgery.

Following hospital protocol, he took a one-month course of Truvada, a cocktail of two anti-HIV drugs, to prevent infection.

Later, because he was an unattached gay man, he decided to keep taking Truvada to protect himself from getting HIV through sex. The practice ? called PrEP, short for pre-exposure prophylaxis  is safe and highly effective. Several studies have shown that users who take the drug daily are at nearly zero risk of HIV infection.

But when Cheng applied for disability insurance  which many young doctors do to protect a lifetimes worth of income should they be hurt  he was told that, because he was taking Truvada, he could have only a five-year policy.

Cheng is healthy, has never had surgery or been hospitalized, and takes no other medication. ""And I never engaged in sexually irresponsible behavior,"" he said. ""Ive always been in longer-term monogamous relationships.""

""I was really shocked,"" he added. ""PrEP is the responsible thing to do. Its the closest thing we have to an HIV vaccine.""

Unable to get the company to change its decision  even after he offered to sign a waiver voiding his policy should he become HIV-infected  he did what some other gay men in similar situations have been forced to do. He stopped taking Truvada.

He then applied to a different insurer  and was offered a lifetime disability policy.

There are nearly 800 life insurers in this country, according to the American Council of Life Insurers. There are no national figures on how many of them have denied coverage to men because they take PrEP.

But insurance brokers, gay-rights advocates and staff at medical clinics said in interviews they had heard of numerous such cases. HIV specialists say the denials endanger mens lives by encouraging them to drop PrEP if they need life, disability or long-term-care insurance.

By contrast, health insurance companies usually cover PrEP, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed in 2014 for anyone at substantial risk of HIV, which includes any gay or bisexual man who might have sex without a condom with anyone of unknown HIV status.

The denials turn the insurance industrys risk-management standard on its head: men who do not protect themselves can get policies, while men who do cannot.

""It doesnt make any sense,"" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and perhaps the nations best-known AIDS doctor. ""It ought to be the other way around.""

Dr. Robert M. Grant, the AIDS researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the clinical trial that established the value of PrEP, said such denials ""really are silly  its like refusing to insure someone because they use seat belts.""

Moreover, advocates argue, the practice singles out gay men for discriminatory treatment. Women, for instance, are not denied coverage if they use birth control pills or get the vaccine against human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer. Yet like Truvada, use of these drugs suggests an active sex life, with the accompanying risks.

And insurers routinely cover applicants with actual diseases controlled by medications, including diabetes, epilepsy, high blood pressure and bipolar disorder.

Bennett Klein, a lawyer for GLAD (GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders), based in Boston, said he knew of 14 instances in which companies denied life insurance, long-term-care insurance or disability insurance to gay men on PrEP, or told brokers they would do so if asked.

The New York Times contacted the ACLI, the industrys trade association, and four of the companies named by Klein, sending each detailed questions about underwriting policies related to Truvada and the sexual habits of applicants, and what other medical conditions caused them to deny coverage. An ACLI spokesman said the council did not collect such information from members.

For competitive reasons, companies do not publicize their underwriting standards and often do not explain why they deny an individual policy. Each policy is denied  or offered at a higher price or shorter term  based on many medical factors, including weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status and so on.

Mutual of Omaha, which Klein is suing for denying long-term-care insurance to an unnamed gay man, declined to answer any questions and said it did not comment on pending litigation.

In motions filed in GLADs suit, Mutual of Omaha conceded that it had denied an applicant coverage because he took Truvada.

The drug is indicated only for persons with HIV or at high risk of acquiring HIV, the company said. Therefore it turned down everyone taking Truvada.

""The fact that the drug is less than 100 percent effective adds yet another layer to the risk profile,"" the company added.

According to internal underwriting guidelines obtained by Klein, Mutual of Omaha sells long-term-care policies to people with Addisons disease, bipolar disorder, depression, mild coronary artery disease, diabetes, epilepsy and high blood pressure, as long as they are controlled by medication for various periods, from six months up to three years.

It also insures former alcoholics who were alcohol-free and in support groups, as well as people who had recovered from heart valve surgery or cancers of the bladder, breast, prostate and skin.

""The irrationality is enough to make your mind spin,"" Klein said.

Other insurers replied to the Times questions with brief answers saying they did not deny coverage solely for taking PrEP but declining to describe what conditions or behaviors would cause them to exclude coverage.

""I am fairly certain that this is just slippery language, and that they are excluding applicants when they see a diagnosis of high risk sexual behavior or exposure to HIV in an applicants medical record,"" Klein said.

Those descriptions are linked to diagnostic codes that doctors use for reimbursement from health insurers when a patient asks for a prescription for Truvada. ""Thats no different from excluding based on PrEP usage alone,"" Klein argued.

Aaron E. Baldwin, a financial planner in San Francisco who specializes in clients living with HIV, said he had been seeing such denials for three years.

Some clients denied coverage, he said, were young executives with large student debts who wanted insurance so that should anything happen to them, their parents would not be saddled with payments.

In his experience, Baldwin said, companies in Midwestern and Southern states were reluctant to insure men taking Truvada, while New York Life, for example, insured even men with HIV as long as they could show they took their medications every day.

In his case, Cheng said, a broker told him that the insurer claimed to be unsure about Truvadas side effects. But the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, and a study published in 2016 concluded that it was safer for long-term use than aspirin, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.

Cheng is now in a long-term relationship with an HIV-negative man, and so he no longer takes Truvada. But the sting of his insurance denial lingers.

""It was blatant discrimination,"" he said.",15/02/2018
Tampa Bay Times,Thursday’s letters: Bill protects pharmacy customers,"House Bill 351

Bill protects pharmacy customers

We all need the protections provided in Florida House Bill 351 to ensure pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are transparently operating with patients. Currently, PBMs are not regulated by the state and often take advantage of this lack of regulation by billing health plans more for prescription drugs than your local pharmacist even charges. This practice allows them to retain an even higher profit, also known as a ""clawback."" Even worse, they often prohibit our local pharmacists from informing us that our medications may be available at a lower price.

As executive director of an organization that began as a Florida grass-roots community organization 33 years ago, I have seen the need to keep businesses honest, transparent and fair for consumers and patients. As a leader dedicated to supporting and protecting health care access for people living with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and patients living with chronic diseases, it is my responsibility to advocate for business practices that provide equitable access and affordable options for those most in need.

Pharmacy benefit managers have the important role of serving as the intermediary that connects drug manufacturers, patients, their health plans and pharmacies. However, when PBMs stand to gain higher profits with their business practices, patients should not be negatively impacted with increased drug prices and restricted pharmacy access.

House Bill 351 will require pharmacy benefit managers to register with Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation, forcing them to adopt much-needed transparency of coverage information for patients. This bill does not prevent them from making a profit, but would prevent the profits from being achieved through higher pricing and limited pharmacy access for patients.

Teen driver, 14, charged | Feb. 11

Problems of parenting

Again, tragedy has struck, and now some Florida legislators want to change the law and protect young adults from the consequences of their actions that result in someone dying.

Truth be told, todays society is to blame and it starts at home with the parents, or in most cases, parent. It takes two parents on the same page to raise a child properly. In my time, you would hear people say they were ""staying together for the sake of the children."" Thats because parents felt responsible and were held accountable for their childrens upbringing and actions. If the parents give up and walk away from their responsibilities, what message does that send to their children?

But parents arent totally to blame; society has neutered them by taking away the fear of physical punishment. And whether you want to admit it or not, fear keeps children in line and, more importantly, alive. However, what good does it do if one family disciplines their children but their peers dont do the same? To quote an old saying, ""It takes a village to raise a child.""

Young minds need nurturing and protecting, and that starts at home. Parents need to engage in what their children watch on TV and stop indulging their children with video games such as Grand Theft Auto. I wonder how many of the kids involved in stealing cars had that video game or a similar one in their home.

Opioids? Sessions suggests aspirin | Feb. 8

We are the tough ones

Attorney General Jeff Sessions dispensed the advice that those of us with chronic pain should just take aspirin and tough it out. I admit that I am not an attorney or a former senator, so perhaps I am missing something. But I have had lupus for 13 years, since I was 15. I know that aspirin, even a handful of them, wouldnt touch my pain. It would make fine work of destroying my esophagus and stomach lining, though.

I know that sometimes even small things like texting or holding onto my steering wheel hurts because all the joints in my hand are aching and swollen. I made it through my undergrad and graduate degrees with sheer grit, and there are millions other people like me. We get through our lives even with people constantly trying to withhold the proper accommodations and care we need. If Sessions and his ilk felt a smidgen of the pain I feel every day, he would be in the corner crying his eyes out. We are the tough ones.

Regional as one-way street

As someone who drives over the Howard Frankland Bridge for work, Lightning games and events at the Straz, Im glad to read that Chuck Sykes and Ron Christaldi finally view themselves as citizens of the Tampa Bay region. Its just too bad they failed to do so for the last 20 years. Where was their ""regional"" view when the Rays were begging for corporate support in St. Petersburg? Its amazing how those in Tampa at the corporate or individual level define our ""regional"" assets only in terms of whether or not theyre located in Tampa. And there was not one word of thanks in their op-ed to the city of St. Petersburg, Pinellas County and its citizens, without whom we wouldnt even have a team.

Twenty years of Tampanians unwilling to cross a bridge to go to a game. Twenty years of Tampa corporations not supporting this now ""regional"" asset. And now you expect us in St. Petersburg to cheer this news and our corporations to do that which you failed to do? Good luck.

Judiciary

Trump is changing America

By getting judges confirmed in record numbers, President Donald Trump is changing America for a generation. Trumps team helped get a record-breaking 12 appeals court judges confirmed during his first year, four times as many as President Barack Obama did in the same time frame. Trump has nominated roughly 80 federal judges, 24 of whom have already been confirmed by the Senate.

The judges Trump picked are, on the whole, smart, experienced and conservative.

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Publix gets it right on HIV drug,"Publix made the right call last week in reversing its policy that denied insurance coverage for a drug that prevents HIV infection. The Lakeland-based supermarket chain is consistently ranked one of Floridas best employers, and this decision will undoubtedly benefit its nearly 190,000 employees. It is also a responsible stand in a state where new HIV cases are on the rise.

Publix initially said it would cover the drug Truvada only to treat existing cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But Truvada is also highly effective for preventing new HIV infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is 92 percent effective at preventing infection among high-risk users, such as individuals whose partners are HIV positive. Publix initially said it wouldnt cover preventive use of the drug, known as Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP.

Preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS has renewed urgency in Florida, which recorded the fourth-highest rate of new cases in the country in 2016. Even as new cases declined around the nation, Florida has seen an increase every year since 2012. This is no time for a major employer to be splitting hairs over covering a drug thats effective at fighting the disease.

Following a public backlash and an in-person plea from Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, Publix announced it would cover the PrEP method. Thats a welcome change of heart from one of Floridas best-loved brands.",08/02/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Publix reverses, will cover HIV prevention drug for workers","By TERRY SPENCER

FORT LAUDERDALE  The Southeasts largest supermarket chain announced Tuesday that it is changing its employee prescription plan to cover a drug that helps prevent HIV infections, remedying an omission that doctors and gay rights groups said was highly unusual.

Publix announced its change in a Twitter reply to Florida state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, an Orlando-area Democrat who had met with company officials Monday to discuss their refusal to cover Truvada for PrEP. The 6-year-old drug is more than 95 percent effective in preventing the contraction of human immunodeficiency virus, which can cause AIDS. It is usually prescribed to HIV-negative gay men and other people at higher risk of infection.

The issue came to light again recently when a website, The Body, noted that a former Publix employee had been denied coverage for PrEP. The Associated Press began reporting on the issue last week but Publix did not respond to numerous calls and detailed messages at that time.

Smith tweeted about his meeting with Publix officials late Monday night, saying they confirmed the decision not to cover the drug but would not say if it ""was based solely on cost or some absurd moral objection they have to PrEP.""

RELATED COVERAGE: Publix ranks sixth best for workplace diversity

Early Tuesday, Publix replied that it had reconsidered its position and would cover PrEP, saying the company is ""committed to the health and well-being of our associates and families."" It issued a statement reiterating its Twitter replies Tuesday afternoon.

Publix officials told Smith during the meeting that the company doesnt usually cover prescriptions to treat a condition an employee might get in the future, but he pointed out it does cover birth control. He said he walked them through a situation where an HIV-negative employee is in a relationship with someone who is HIV-positive. Covering the employees PrEP is both morally and financially sound, he said.

""I think they know and understand that this is the right thing to do for their employees,"" said Smith, Floridas only openly gay legislator.

HIV specialists and gay rights groups say the drug is almost universally covered by large employers who provide prescription drug coverage for their workers. Gilead Sciences, its manufacturer, estimated U.S. usage at 120,000 people last year.

Dr. David Holland, chief clinical officer for communicable diseases at the Fulton County Board of Health in Atlanta, said that since 2015 the countys HIV prevention program has prescribed Truvada for PrEP 255 times. He confirmed that the former Publix employee, a Georgia resident, had been denied coverage  the only such case hed seen. Holland said some patients take it for a short time when they are at highest risk; others, for years.

The former employee told the AP last week that he left Publix at the end of 2016 after being with the company for a year, primarily over the drug issue. He said his new employer pays for his PrEP prescription, which costs about $1,500 a month for individual buyers. Insurance companies typically negotiate discounts with pharmacies. The man asked that his name and occupation be withheld to protect his privacy.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the average lifetime cost of treating a person who becomes HIV positive at 35 is $449,000. That does not include treating anyone else the person might infect.

Publix has 188,000 employees at 1,169 stores in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia. The chain usually scores well on surveys of customer and employee satisfaction but has received low scores from the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. It called Tuesdays decision ""a positive step.""

Smith said Publix scores low with the group because it does not include protections for gay or transgender people in its anti-discrimination policies and didnt recognize same-sex relationships until just before gay marriage became legal in Florida.

Scott Schoettes, HIV project director at Lambda Legal, a gay rights organization, said it is unclear whether companies are legally required to cover Truvada for PrEP. He said a refusal might be considered unlawful discrimination against a persons sexuality or HIV status, but no case has gone to court. He said he is unaware of any other large employer refusing to cover Truvada for PrEP.

""Whether or not it is illegal, it is misguided from both a health perspective and an economic perspective. You dont have to be a rocket scientist to know that it is better and cheaper if someone isnt infected,"" he said.

Federal law requires insurers cover treatment for clients who are HIV positive.

As preventative measures and education have improved, the CDC says the number of U.S. residents contracting HIV dropped to 37,600 in 2014, the latest year available  an 18 percent decline since 2008.

Still, about 1.2 million people in the U.S. are HIV positive and 6,721 people died of AIDS or HIV in 2014  an 87 percent drop since fatalities peaked at 50,877 in 1995, just before the first treatments became widely available.",06/02/2018

Rare find could trigger more

A skeleton has been unearthed in the Western Desert, whose ancient sands have long helped preserve remains, but unlike most finds this one isnt a mummy  its a dinosaur. Researchers from Mansoura University in Egypts Nile Delta discovered the new species of long-necked herbivore, which is around the size of a city bus, and it could be just the tip of the sand dune for other desert dinosaur discoveries. ""As in any ecosystem, if we went to the jungle, well find a lion and a giraffe. So we found the giraffe, wheres the lion?"" said Hesham Sallam, excavation leader and head of the universitys Center for Vertebrate Paleontology. Sallam, along with four Egyptian and five American researchers, in late January announced the discovery in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Experts say the landmark find could shed light on a particularly obscure period of history for the African continent, roughly the 30 million years before dinosaurs went extinct, between 70 and 80 million years ago. Named Mansourasaurus Shahinae, the find is the only dinosaur from the late Mesozoic era to have been discovered in Africa, and it may even be an undiscovered genus.

Britain

Officials to consider posthumous pardons for suffragettes

Britain will consider pardons for suffragettes convicted during the struggle for womens right to vote, an official said Tuesday, a century to the day since the Representation of the People Act extended voting rights to all British men aged 21 and up, and to millions of women over 30. British women did not get the same voting rights as men until 1928. Suffragettes used public protests, civil disobedience and occasionally violence in their campaign. More than 1,300 were arrested, and many were jailed. Some endured force feeding in prison. Campaigners have called for convicted suffragettes to receive posthumous pardons. Speaking on the BBC, Home Secretary Amber Rudd cautioned its complicated ""to give a legal pardon for things like arson and violence."" Labour Partys Jeremy Corbyn said if elected, he would pardon the suffragettes and give an official apology. Prime Minister Theresa May  Britains second female leader  used Tuesdays anniversary to call for more civility in politics, saying some women are deterred from entering politics because of the abuse they face.

Assange not as lucky

A British judge upheld the arrest warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Tuesday, assuring he would remain in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has hid for the past 5½ years after Swedish prosecutors sought his arrest over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Judge Emma Arbuthnot said she would rule next Tuesday on a new bid to have the warrant dropped on the grounds of public interest. Even if its dropped, the 46-year-old was never assured of leaving the embassy, although Ecuador recently granted him citizenship and Sweden dropped its investigation. Assange fears being arrested for breaching bail conditions in Britain and of being extradited to the United States, where he faces prosecution for leaking documents on WikiLeaks.

Fake doctor infects 21 villagers with HIV via tainted syringes

A fake doctor treating poor villagers for colds, coughs and diarrhea has infected at least 21 people with HIV by using contaminated syringes and needles, a health official said Tuesday. Sushil Choudhury added police were looking for Rajendra Yadav, who fled small-town Bangarmau in Uttar Pradesh state, after the HIV infections were detected in December. The villagers said they rarely saw Yadav changing the needles and complained that he gave injections for almost all ailments. With Indias health care system facing a massive shortage of doctors and hospitals, millions of poor people seek fake doctors for cheap treatment. India had 2.1 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016, according to a UNAIDS report. Of those, 9,100 were children under age 15. India has registered a 20 percent annual decline in new infections over the past few years, according to the report.

The president on Tuesday signed legislation that outlaws blaming Poland as a nation for Holocaust crimes committed by Nazi Germany, defying both criticism from Israel and a warning from the U.S. But in a move that appeared designed to soften his decision, Andrzej Duda said he also would ask the constitutional court to evaluate the bill  leaving open the possibility it would be amended. The law calls for prison terms of up to three years for falsely attributing the crimes of Nazi Germany to occupied Poland. Officials say they want to protect Polands reputation from what it believes is confusion about who bears responsibility for Auschwitz and other death camps. Israel fears the law would stifle discussion about the Holocaust and enable Poland to whitewash the role of Poles who denounced or killed Jews.  tbt* wires",06/02/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"Q&A: Retiring fire chief recalls busy shifts, amazing people’ and one crazed cat","PINELLAS PARK  After 33 years with the Pinellas Park Fire Department, the last three as chief, Guy Keirn has retired.

Incoming Pinellas Park Fire Chief Brett Schlatterer describes Keirn, 54, as one of the most caring people hes met  a consummate professional, a skilled administrator and a great dad. Seminole Fire Chief Heather Buford considers Keirn a leader and mentor.

In his retirement letter, Keirn noted that a career in public service was his destiny, and that becoming a Pinellas Park firefighter was one of the best decisions of his life.

""The city of Pinellas Park gave me the opportunity to work with amazing people whose impact shaped the person I am today,"" Keirn wrote. ""For all the relationships, experiences, and opportunities bestowed to me by this great city, I am forever thankful.""

Here is an interview with Keirn, in which he recalled some highlights of his three-decade career:

What were the most challenging issues you confronted as a firefighter and as a fire chief?

Very early on, back in the 1980s, the Centers for Disease Control made us aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. There were so many unknowns; everyone was struggling to understand it. We were concerned about how best to serve the public, and for our own safety as well. It meant huge changes for everyone involved with public safety, not only those of us in Pinellas Park, but firefighters and medical personnel across the country.

Then in 2013, my first year as interim fire chief, we lost the contract to provide fire protection services for the eastern portion of the High Point Fire District. Losing that contract meant 13 firefighters would lose their jobs. That was hard. When youre a pubic servant, its your responsibility to take care of your employees and the families that depend on them. I felt it was up to me and to city staff to do whatever we could to protect them. With a lot of hard work, and with help from city hall, we were able through attrition to find other jobs for those individuals.

How did being a member of the Pinellas Park Fire Department change you as a human being?

It showed me that being a public servant ties you to the community. Belonging to a community-based agency like a fire department taught me to make decisions based on the needs of the community instead of my own needs. I realized how much people want you to engage with them, to be empathetic to their needs. Firefighters are phenomenal about how they engage with the members of the community. Thats a big part of the job.

Do you have any kitten-stuck-in-a-tree stories from your days as a firefighter?

Years back, about 1996, (Pinellas Park firefighter) Pete Huffman and I were called out to rescue a cat that was stuck in the attic of a local animal shelter. I held an 18-foot ladder for Pete and watched him disappear into the attic. Next thing I know, hes hollering for me to come up and give him a hand because the cat isnt cooperating. I didnt have much choice but to ask the three elderly ladies who were volunteering at the shelter that day to hold the ladder for me. I went up and Pete handed the cat out the window to me. There I was, more than two stories off the ground with a terrified animal trying to tear my face off, dependent on those three ladies to keep the ladder steady. After all these years, I still think about the day we rescued that cat every time I drive past the building.

Did anything surprise you during your career?

Becoming fire chief. Doug Lewis, who was chief at the time, called me into his office on a Monday and told me he was naming me interim fire chief that Wednesday. I was not expecting that. I saw it in my future at some point, but I didnt think it would happen that quickly, and I certainly didnt think I would have only a two-day notice.

What did you miss most about being a firefighter when you became chief?

Working as part of a team. Being a firefighter is like being a member of a softball team or a choir or a band. You need to pull together as a cohesive unit. You work with these extraordinary people when youre a firefighter. You work side by side and get really close. When that bell rings, you move out as a team. That changed when I became an administrator. I missed that camaraderie.

Of all your duties as fire chief, which one did you look most forward to performing? What came as the biggest challenge?

My favorite part of being Fire Chief has been seeing new firefighters come into the organization and watching them recognize their passion for public service. Ive really enjoyed seeing so many of them grow personally and professionally. Its been an amazing thing. Ive enjoyed the opportunity to serve in an informal mentorship role to try to guide them and motivate them and keep them moving forward.

The most challenging part has been learning to refrain from making emotional decisions. When youre making decisions that impact peoples lives, you have to take that emotional element out and think about whats best for the individuals and for the city.

Are there any misperceptions about firefighters that you can address?

A lot of people dont understand the intense workload of a firefighter. Especially in Pinellas County, where we respond to more calls than the national average. Firefighters are extremely busy. On every shift, in addition to responding to calls, theyre out doing inspections, installing smoke detectors and maintaining more than 70 tools on a fire truck. They also have to keep up their skills and competencies. As fire services have expanded, a firefighters responsibilities have increased exponentially.

If you were to dedicate another decade to the Pinellas Park Fire Department, what would be your focus?

One of the things weve really focused on since I became chief is increasing our community outreach programs, especially installation of smoke detectors. One of our goals has been to make sure every bedroom in every house in the city has a smoke detector. Weve also been focused on the number of citizens who are trained in CPR. If I were to stay longer, I would continue to focus on those programs. The more you can educate the public, the better chance you have of saving a life.",01/02/2018
Tampa Bay Times,This needle-exchange program is saving lives in Miami-Dade. Now it could be coming to Tampa Bay.,"A typical syringe costs about seven cents, but for Hansel Tookes, it's worth much more.

For 13 months, the University of Miami doctor and medical professor and a team of staffers have been exchanging used needles for clean ones as part of a five-year pilot program in Miami-Dade County to cut down on the spread of HIV, hepatitis C and other blood-borne diseases among drug users.

Each syringe is more than just pennies: It's one less opportunity to spread disease and one less chance to injure someone who might come across discarded needles in the street, Tookes says. It also means one more opportunity to work with hundreds of drug users who might not otherwise get access to the program's life-saving overdose reversal drugs or substance abuse counseling.

Amid a ballooning opioid crisis across the state, advocates in areas including Tampa and Palm Beach County want similar programs. But the same 2016 law that created Miami-Dade's test run underscores a reality for the rest of the state: needle exchanges elsewhere are still not legal.

Tookes, who spearheaded the push for his pilot program, wants to change that by passing another law in Tallahassee that would allow similar needle exchange programs to start statewide. ""A lot of people said when we first came back, 'Isn't the pilot five years? Why are they back?' We're back because people are dying. We're back because people are becoming infected with HIV and hepatitis C, and it's all avoidable.""

Since the five-year test program — the IDEA Exchange, for the Infectious Disease Elimination Act — launched in December 2016, more than 600 people have passed through the program's doors since it opened in December 2016, Tookes said, and more than 330 units of overdose-reviving naloxone, or Narcan, have been distributed and used. Though it will take years to measure a decrease in HIV infection rates, Tookes said the number of used naloxone units indicates the number of overdose deaths have already likely decreased since the program began.

Injection drug use is of particularly pressing concern in South Florida, where rates of new HIV infections in Miami-Fort Lauderdale have consistently topped those in the rest of the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though dirty needles are only one risk factor for transmission, needle exchanges are a way to draw users somewhere they can connect to disease testing and treatment, advocates say.

""The idea of a needle exchange is a way for us to truly connect with the most vulnerable people,"" said Matt Zweil, who wants to start an exchange program in Tampa. ""They're dying by the droves.""

Zweil, a 37-year-old consulting engineer, helped found Safe Exchange Tampa seven months ago after a friend died of an overdose the day she left rehab. After co-founder Steven Spector told him about needle exchange programs, he was so spurred that he started incorporating the group the following morning — only to discover as he was about to file paperwork that the practice is, with the exception of Miami-Dade's pilot program, not allowed.

Zweil has since traveled to Tallahassee with Tookes and other advocates to support the new bill, and turned his efforts to distributing naloxone and holding weekly trainings at clinics in Tampa in the meantime.

When Tookes first came to Tallahassee in 2012 to advocate for changing needle-exchange laws in the state, lawmakers were much less receptive to that message, concerned that needle exchanges might just encourage drug use.

But the rising number of opioid deaths — and increased use of needles after Florida shut down ""pill mills"" starting in 2011 — have made the legislation much more appealing since. Advocates have also hammered a cost-saving argument for the legislation, citing the high costs for treating transmitted diseases compared to the relatively low price tag for funding a preventive program like needle exchanges.

The new legislation, which would allow groups like Zweil's to run their own versions of Miami-Dade's pilot program, sailed through House and Senate subcommittees with unanimous votes this week. The legislation is supported, too, by a bevy of municipalities and healthcare groups, including Broward County, the Florida Hospital Association and the AIDS Institute.

""This is a bipartisan effort to save lives in the state of Florida,"" said Rep. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, who is sponsoring HB 579.

There may yet be a legislative fight as it winds through the House, but Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, who is sponsoring SB 800 in the Senate, says he expects it to pass in that chamber.

The new legislation, like the bill that came before it, would not provide state funds and would require such programs to rely entirely on private funding. A recent amendment to the House bill also changes language so the additional programs will not be run by the Department of Health or require additional administrative funds.

Zweil said he has already spent about $20,000 on the weekly trainings in Tampa this year, buoyed by a generous engineer's salary, and expects to spend another $60,000 to $70,000 should the legislation pass next year. But compared to the UM program's nearly $500,000 budget, his funding would be shoestring, he acknowledged. He said he would rely on volunteers to staff the program — the biggest overhead cost — and plans to apply for private funding after the bill is passed.

""I'm buying us a bus on day one when it's signed by the governor,"" said Zweil, who has been funding the project out of his own pocket. ""We're going to be the first through the door at the Department of Health to be certified to be a new pilot program.""

Justin Kunzelman, who directs the non-profit Rebel Recovery in Palm Beach County, began handing out naloxone and syringes on his own to friends in 2015. A former drug user, he would also advocate at municipal meetings for policy changes, carrying stacks of peer-reviewed studies on the positive outcomes of needle-exchange programs in other states.

""For a long time it was just me yelling in public meetings — 'we need syringe exchange' — and being told that's never going to happen,"" he said. ""We're not going to help people use drugs.""

The group also surreptitiously handed out needles for about a year until Rebel Recovery officially incorporated last February, he said, and is waiting for the legislation to pass before they resume their work.

But passing the bill is also one step — though a large one — toward reducing the stigma toward drug users and making headway against the transmission of blood-borne diseases, he said. Building a successful syringe exchange also requires building up the community's trust and encouraging people to use the program.

""The exchanging of syringes is not the real work — that's easy, I could do that out of my house if I wanted to,"" Kunzelman said. ""It's changing the culture where people feel like that's something that's OK.

""That's the message: We actually care about you as a person. Just because somebody uses drugs doesn't mean they deserve to live with HIV or hepatitis C for the rest of their lives.""",26/01/2018
Tampa Bay Times,"It’s flu season, and how: Here’s what you need to know","Cristi Fryberger, a fifth-grade teacher, was headed back for the first day of classes at St. Petersburg Christian School after the Christmas break but didnt feel well. She left a couple of hours later and went to an urgent care clinic, where a swab of her nose and an in-office rapid test soon confirmed she had the flu. ""I was surprised because I thought I would feel a lot worse,"" said the 34-year-old Clearwater resident, ""but they told me this is just day one and I saw what they meant after that.""

The next day and for four days after her diagnosis, Fryberger, the mother of a 9-year-old daughter and 14-year-old stepson, felt so sick that she could hardly get out of bed. ""I dont think Ive ever had the flu before. Ive had colds but not this,"" she said. ""It wipes you out. I didnt have the energy to get out of bed. Thank goodness my kids are older.""

Thats pretty typical of how flu patients feel, said Dr. Keith Waldrep, director of physician services for BayCare Urgent Care. ""The distinguishing factor with the flu is the misery,"" said Waldrep, who oversees BayCares 15 urgent care clinics in Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough and Polk counties. ""With the flu, the body aches, you have the fatigue and people are just confined to bed. Its difficult to function. With a cold, most people can still function. But with the flu they cant. Theyre miserable.""

In addition to body aches and fatigue, other common symptoms of influenza include fever that lasts several days, chills, a sore throat, a headache, coughing and a runny or stuffy nose.

The onset of symptoms is usually sudden. Many patients can tell you what time they started feeling bad. Illness can range from mild to severe; sometimes there can be life-threatening complications.

All four family members in Frybergers household were sick in succession, although Fryberger was the only one who was tested for influenza. ""The whole house got sick,"" she said, ""starting with (my daughter) the day after Christmas with a cough and a low-grade fever. Then my husband, who had the same thing, then Julian, my stepson, he seemed to be worse, then mine started."" Fryberger said she and Julian, who has a chronic illness, seemed to suffer the most, while her daughter and husband seemed to have a milder case of the illness.

RELATED: Pinellas is at the center of a rise in Florida flu outbreaks

Waldrep said that on a recent day in the urgent care clinic he saw 60 patients and 22 were positive for the flu. ""Thats a lot,"" he said, adding that the flu patients he and his colleagues are seeing are more sick than usual. That tells him that the circulating flu viruses are very aggressive. ""The most alarming trend, though, is the higher percentage of patients over age 65 were seeing with the flu,"" Waldrep said. ""They are at high risk for complications from the flu, and this H3N2 strain thats circulating right now seems to be targeting them.""

H3N2 is the predominant strain of influenza that has sickened millions of Americans across the United States. The flu season typically starts in October and peaks in January or February, but cases may continue for months after the peak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports widespread flu activity in every state except Hawaii.

Dr. Jason Castro, a family medicine physician at the Tampa General Medical Group in Tampa Palms, said his group is seeing a lot of influenza as well. ""We arent sending many to the hospital, fortunately, but the patients were seeing are sick, have a lot of symptoms, and they are taking a lot of time to get better.""

Castro said its important to be aware of the symptoms of the flu so, if necessary, you can get medical care to prevent serious complications and to prevent infecting others.

Once youve been infected, it can take from one to five days for symptoms to appear. Youre most contagious, most likely to spread the virus, the day before you develop symptoms and for about the next four to five days or until the day after your fever breaks. So during that infectious time, you should take particular precautions to prevent spreading the virus to others. That means wash your hands frequently, stay at home, dont invite visitors over and cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, disposing of the tissue properly. Be sure caregivers wash their hands, too. Castro said that covering your mouth and nose cant be stressed enough. Youre more likely to spread the flu by coughing or sneezing directly on people and less likely to pick it up from touching surfaces and objects.

Castro also recommends going to the doctor at the first sign of symptoms so you can be tested and, if positive, be given a prescription for a flu-fighting drug such as Tamiflu, which can shorten the duration of illness. ""But, Tamiflu must be given within the first 24 to 30 hours of developing symptoms to get the greatest benefit. Most doctors wont give it to you if youve been sick for 72 hours or longer,"" he said. Tamiflu can shorten the course of influenza by up to three days if given early enough.

Fryberger, who decided against flu shots for herself and her family, took Tamiflu and was able to resume normal activities in about six days. But up until that point she said she was either in bed or on the couch. How sick you get depends on how much virus youre exposed to and your general health at the time you become ill. People with illnesses such as heart, lung, kidney and other chronic diseases are at high risk for serious complications from the flu. So are those with a compromised immune system, including cancer and HIV patients. Pregnant women and women who have given birth within two weeks are also at high risk for complications. So are adults age 65 and older and the very young.

Otherwise healthy adults who come down with the flu can often take care of themselves at home. Those in high-risk groups and those with chronic medical conditions will likely need to see or at least talk with their doctor. You should go to the emergency room if you have difficulty breathing, have a fever that isnt controlled with over-the-counter medication (after taking two doses), cant keep fluids down or have chest pain, confusion or dizziness. Emergency symptoms in children include difficulty breathing, bluish skin color, not drinking, fewer wet diapers, not waking or interacting, fever with skin rash and uncharacteristic irritability.

While no Tampa Bay area hospitals are reporting an influx of flu patients, some are seeing higher than normal flu-related admissions. As of Jan. 11, Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater had admitted 34 flu patients; St. Josephs Hospital in Tampa, 43; and St. Anthonys Hospital in St. Petersburg, 41. As of Jan. 9, Tampa General Hospital had admitted 14 flu patients.

According to the CDC, flu cases may be starting to level off, but the season is by no means over.

If you havent gotten the flu vaccine and havent had the flu, then the recommendation is still to get a flu shot.

""If you do come down with the flu, chances are you will have a less severe case if you are vaccinated,"" Waldrep said.

More importantly, the greater the number of people who are vaccinated, the fewer the number of people who can become infected and transmit the flu to high-risk individuals  people you encounter in the grocery store, at church, school, the gym, your own family.

""Youre doing something good for others,"" Waldrep said. ""We have a long season still ahead of us. I think well see flu cases all the way up until May. So get the vaccine if you havent had the flu.""

Tampa Bay Times,Giant 910-carat diamond is one of the largest ever found,"LONDON  High in the mountains of a small southern African kingdom, miners have unearthed one of the largest diamonds ever found, a glittering giant weighing 910 carats, or 6.4 ounces, and probably worth tens of millions of dollars.

The stone, found in the Letseng mine in Lesotho, is the fifth-largest gem-quality diamond ever found, and the largest in Lesothos history. It weighs more than a regulation baseball (about 5 ounces), and more than half as much as the average male human heart (about 10 ounces).

Gem Diamonds, the London-based company that owns a majority stake in the mine and that announced the find Monday, described the diamond as being of extremely high quality.

It said the stone is a D color, Type IIa diamond, meaning it is colorless and very radiant, without any yellow tint or impurities like nitrogen that absorb light and decrease luster.

Gem Diamonds stock jumped sharply on news of the discovery.

How much the rough stone will fetch at auction remains to be seen, and it will depend in part on any imperfections that limit the size of the cut and polished stones it can be fashioned into. The previous largest find in Lesotho, the 603-carat Lesotho Promise diamond, sold for $12.4 million in 2006, and diamond prices have increased significantly since then.

Stones of that size can make some of the worlds most extravagant finished jewels seem like mere baubles. Elizabeth Taylors famous collection of hefty jewels included a 33-carat diamond ring that sold at auction for $8.8 million in 2011, and a 69-carat diamond, both bought for her by Richard Burton in the late 1960s.

The largest gem-quality diamond ever discovered, the Cullinan Diamond, weighed more than 3,100 carats, nearly three times as much as the next biggest. Several of the worlds largest finished diamonds were cut from it and incorporated into Britains Crown Jewels.

The Letseng mine, at an elevation of almost 10,000 feet, is known for producing very large, high-quality diamonds. The government of Lesotho, a constitutional monarchy surrounded by South Africa, owns a minority stake in the mine.

Diamonds and garments make up almost the entire export economy of Lesotho, a country with high rates of poverty and HIV infection. It ranks 160th out of 188 countries on the U.N. Human Development Index.",15/01/2018
Tampa Bay Times,This is why your car company may know more about you than your spouse,"DETROIT  Daniel Dunn was about to sign a lease for a Honda Fit last year when a detail buried in the lengthy agreement caught his eye.

Honda wanted to track the location of his vehicle, the contract stated  according to Dunn  a stipulation that struck the 69-year-old Temecula, Calif., retiree as a bit odd. But Dunn was eager to drive away in his new car and, despite initial hesitation, he signed the document, a decision with which he has since made peace.

""I dont care if they know where I go,"" said Dunn, who makes regular trips to the grocery store and a yoga studio in his vehicle. ""Theyre probably thinking, What a boring life this guys got.""

Dunn may consider his everyday driving habits mundane, but auto and privacy experts suspect that big automakers like Honda see them as anything but. By monitoring his everyday movements, an automaker can vacuum up a massive amount of personal information about someone like Dunn, everything from how fast he drives and how hard he brakes to how much fuel his car uses and the entertainment he prefers. The company can determine where he shops, the weather on his street, how often he wears his seat belt, what he was doing moments before a wreck  even where he likes to eat and how much he weighs.

Though drivers may not realize it, tens of millions of American cars are being monitored like Dunns, experts say, and the number increases with nearly every new vehicle that is leased or sold.

The result is that carmakers have turned on a powerful spigot of precious personal data, often without owners knowledge, transforming the automobile from a machine that helps us travel to a sophisticated computer on wheels that offers even more access to our personal habits and behaviors than smartphones do.

""The thing that car manufacturers realize now is that theyre not only hardware companies anymore  theyre software companies,"" said Lisa Joy Rosner, chief marketing officer of Otonomo, a company that sells connected-car data, sharing the profits with automakers. ""The first space shuttle contained 500,000 lines of software code, but compare that to Fords projection that by 2020 their vehicles will contain 100 million lines of code. These vehicles are becoming turbocharged spaceships if you think of them from a purely horsepower perspective.""

Automakers say they collect customer data only with explicit permission, though that permission is often buried in lengthy service agreements. They argue that data is used to improve performance and enhance vehicle safety. The information that is gathered, they add, will soon be able to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities, saving tens of thousands of lives.

There are 78 million cars on the road with an embedded cyber connection, a feature that makes monitoring customers easier, according to ABI Research. By 2021, according to the technology research firm Gartner, 98 percent of new cars sold in the United States and in Europe will be connected, a feature that is also being highlighted this week here at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

After being asked on multiple occasions what the company does with collected data, Natalie Kumaratne, a Honda spokeswoman, said that the company ""cannot provide specifics at this time."" Kumaratne instead sent a copy of an owners manual for a Honda Clarity that notes that the vehicle is equipped with multiple monitoring systems that transmit data at a rate determined by Honda.

Connecting cars to computers is nothing new. Vehicles have relied on computerized systems since the 1960s, mostly in the form of diagnostic systems that remind drivers to check their engines and ""event data recorders,"" which capture accident data and are considered the ""black boxes"" of automobiles.

Whats changed in recent years is not only the volume and precision of that data but how its being extracted and connected to the Internet, according to Lauren Smith, who studies big data and cars as the policy counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum.

""Before, devices that generate data would stay on the car, but there are new ways for that information to be communicated off the vehicle,"" Smith said, referring to diagnostic services such as Verizon Hum, Zubie and Autobrain that connect cars to the Internet using a ""key"" or dongle that plugs into a vehicle. These services provide drivers and companies with everything from trip histories to maintenance issues.

Though the automotive industry still collects less personal information than the financial, health-care or education industries, experts say, it doesnt take much to jeopardize customers privacy.

Some privacy experts believe that with enough data points about driver behavior, profiles as unique as fingerprints could be developed. But its location data, experts say, that already has the greatest potential to put customers at risk.

""Most people dont realize how deeply ingrained their habits are and how where we park our car on a regular basis can tell someone many things about us,"" Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, said, noting that research shows that even aggregate data can be reinterpreted to track an individuals habits. ""Theres a load of anti-fraud companies and law enforcement agencies that would love to purchase this data, which can reveal our most intimate habits.""

Trips to homes or businesses reveal buying habits and relationships that could be valuable to corporations, government agencies or law enforcement. For example, regular visits to an HIV clinic can offer information about someones health.

But unlike information gathered by a hospital or a clinic, health data collected by a non-health provider isnt covered by the federal privacy rule known as HIPPA, according to the National Institutes of Health.

In a 2014 letter to the Federal Trade Commission, automakers pledged to abide by a set of privacy policies that included not sharing information with third parties without owners consent.

Theyve tucked their warnings about data collection into a few lines of text in owners manuals or enticing lease and purchase agreements, and on their websites.

General Motors, which became one of the first automakers to start collecting customer data in real time with its OnStar system in 1996, said in an email that the companys system ""does not collect or use any personally identifiable customer data without a customers consent.""

""Before a customer even gives consent, we describe what kind of data is to be collected and how it will be used (mobile app, proactive alerts, etc.),"" Dan Pierce, a GM spokesman, said. ""If a customer declines, we do not collect any data from the vehicle.""

Karen Hampton, a Ford spokeswoman, replied to the Washington Post with a similar statement.

On a page outlining its customers privacy rights, Toyota notes that vehicle data is collected to improve safety, manage maintenance and analyze vehicle trends. The site also notes that, with permission, customer data may be shared with ""companies affiliated with Toyota.""

Though people might be wary of their data being outsourced, Rosner said companies like Otonomo are focused on using customer data for the greater good  such as improving transportation, reducing emissions and saving lives with automatic crash detection.

Otonomo, which began in 2015 and calls itself the ""first connected car data marketplace,"" partners with major automakers that give Otonomo access to their raw driver data, the company said. Otonomo takes that data, analyzes it, and then sells the information to third parties, helping automakers commercialize their data, Rosner said.

What sort of third parties use Otonomo data? A parking app developer, for example, that wants to better understand a citys traffic patterns, or a company that wants to use those patterns to chose the location of its next billboard or business.

""The automaker gets a revenue share on every piece of data that is consumed,"" Rosner explained.

Though the pledge restricts automakers from selling data to an outside company without customers consent, experts have noted that the voluntary self-regulatory standard doesnt stop them from using that data for their own benefit.

The law has been unable to keep up with rapid advancements in auto technology, according to Ryan Calo, an associate professor of law at the University of Washington who teaches courses on robotics law and policy.

""Ultimately, theres no car privacy statute that car companies have to abide by,"" he said. ""Not only are automakers collecting a lot of data, they dont have a particular regime that is regulating how they do it.""

Though the possibility of abuse exists, Calo and other experts say automakers have so far been ""responsive"" to concerns about data collection and privacy. While privacy scandals periodically erupt in Silicon Valley, automakers have sought to differentiate their business models by ensuring privacy, according to James Hodgson, a senior analyst at ABI Research.

""They want to sell cars and maintain a competitive advantage over the Googles and Apples of the world,"" he said.

And yet, Calo said, by collecting massive amounts of data, car companies could be setting themselves up for the 21st centurys ultimate Faustian bargain. The more data a company collects, the more incentive the company has to monetize that data.

""Any company that has tons of data about consumers and can control the interaction with them is going to have the capability and incentive to try to use that information to the companys advantage - and possibly to the detriment of consumers,"" Calo said.

""Its almost unavoidable,"" he added.",16/01/2018
Tampa Bay Times,California chain of medical marijuana clinics downsizing Florida operations,"Floridas first chain of walk-in clinics for medical marijuana treatment is closing most of them less than six months after opening.

Tetra Health Care, a California-based chain that hires licensed doctors to write medical marijuana recommendations at six clinics in Florida, is closing all but one to focus on working with state lawmakers to make access easier for patients, a spokeswoman said.

Tetra had five locations in the Tampa Bay area: two in Tampa and one each in St. Petersburg, Clearwater and Brandon. A sixth is in the Orlando area.

Now patients are being directed to one remaining center in Tampa, at 2814 W Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., for appointments and doctor recommendations.

Tetra said it will not reopen the former centers, but could open new ones in the future.

The company said recent changes to qualifying conditions as well as delays in issuing medical marijuana cards to patients are driving the clinic closures.

""Even though 72 percent of Florida residents voted yes for Amendment 2, there have been many challenges in providing our services to patients in need of medical marijuana,"" Tanya Cielo, the spokeswoman for Tetra, said in an email. ""Between the legislative actions that have changed qualifying conditions to the states delay in issuing medical cards to patients, medical providers like Tetra Health Care are facing serious roadblocks to providing compassionate patient care.""

But Ben Pollara, executive director of marijuana advocacy organization Florida for Care and one of the authors of the medical marijuana amendment, said those reasons didnt ring true. Pollara, who had not heard of Tetra until speaking with a reporter Wednesday, said the state has ""gigantically expanded"" conditions that qualify patients for medical marijuana. And, he said, wait times for medical marijuana cards from the Department of Health have decreased; patients used to wait four to eight weeks for cards and are now getting them in less than four weeks.

""It sounds like these guys had a bad run at it, and theyre getting out of town,"" Pollara said. ""But I think to ascribe these external factors to the (companys) failures is a little bit of a stretch.""

When asked to respond to Pollaras comments, the Tetra spokeswoman reiterated the companys stance.

Patients who visit Tetra in search of medical marijuana need to bring a valid Florida ID and proof of residency in the state for either a walk-in visit or appointment. Staffers walk potential patients through the criteria required by the Florida Department of Health to help them register as patients. Once applicants pay the $75 state fee and receive registration cards in the mail, they can go to a dispensary with the recommendation they receive from a Tetra physician to fill an order. Tetra charges $198 for the service.

Tetra isnt affiliated with any statewide dispensing company, and patients can fill their orders at any dispensary.

Pollara said companies with that business model usually get paid up front, no matter how long it takes for the patient to receive a card from the state.

More than 39,000 Floridians have signed up through the Department of Health to receive medical marijuana as a form of treatment for a list of qualifying illnesses since the registry opened in 2016. And more than 1,000 physicians have taken the state-mandated course that officially qualifies them to examine those patients and recommend products that might help. But backlogs at the Department of Health to issue patients their required identification cards has slowed down access.

""It takes approximately 30 days to process a complete application,"" said Health Department spokeswoman Mara Gambineri. ""As directed by the law, the department is working to outsource this function.""

Qualifying conditions for Floridians seeking medical marijuana treatment include cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain, among other ailments.

Tampa Bay Times,Ruth: The CDC’s seven dirty words,"Do you suspect the paper-pushers who run the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were channeling their inner George Carlin? Youre [email protected]!^&$ right they were!

Years ago, the late comedian delivered a brilliant routine on the seven dirty words youre not allowed to utter in polite company, or on the airwaves, or in a family newspaper. If youve ever spent time on a golf course, youve probably heard them all before you got to the first green.

But what is considered profane has taken on a new twist, as the Washington Post reported, when officials at the CDC, presumably at the direction of their linguistic masters at the Department of Health and Human Services, decreed that henceforth an additional seven naughty words are forthwith banned within the halls of bureaucracy.

And what are these horrible, dreadful, disgusting words? We pause here so you can remove women and children from the room lest they be scandalized.

Here are the seven words that dare not be expressed: ""vulnerable,"" ""entitlement,"" ""diversity,"" ""transgender,"" ""fetus,"" ""evidence-based"" and (oh, the Lenny Bruce of it all!) ""science-based.""

Sort of puts a new spin on swearing like a schoolmarm, doesnt it?

Just why an agency charged with doing stuff related to health, which unfortunately requires committing science, would be prohibited from using words and phrases that are an intrinsic part of the medical lexicon isnt entirely clear. But this is an administration that recoils in horror over a term like ""climate change"" as if it was a line of dialogue from Reservoir Dogs.

The Post suggested the ban was imposed on the CDC as part of the budget process when federal agencies are submitting their requests to the Office of Management and Budget, which wields great sway over how money will be allocated to various departments.

And so, the theory goes, if some bean-counter at the OMB were to read a budget line item from the CDC requesting funding to continue research into, say, how the opioid crisis afflicts ""vulnerable"" people, the money might vanish since the Trump administration has little use for folks who succumb to weakness.

The problem is particularly acute since the CDC is deeply involved in studies into HIV transmission among transgender people as well as birth defects found in developing fetuses caused by the Zika virus. What is the CDC to do? Start referring to the transgender as ""those people,"" or fetuses as the ""pre-pacifer"" community?

Ever helpful, CDC officials offered some guidance to its scientists on how to get around the mandated seven icky words and terms. For example, instead of using ""science-based"" or ""evidence-based,"" CDC employees could explain an agency policy is based ""on science in consideration with community standards and wishes.""

And thus, in this administration at least, ""diversity"" could be construed as whats left over after you eliminate everyone who is black, Hispanic, Muslim, gay, lesbian, a climate change believer, an evolutionist, poor, a public school student and a resident of a blue state.

In a sense, the CDC ban on workplace vocabulary has opened up a new, fertile field for creative cursing.

Miss a 3-foot putt to lose a $5 bet? ""Why you no-good, dirty, rotten entitlement!?""

Or how about, ""Hey you miserable children! Get off of my evidence-based lawn!""

The Bucs lose yet another game and you make your way to the car muttering, ""Transgender!"" Oh, you potty-mouth, you.

When the tenants upstairs start playing Led Zeppelin at 3 in the morning, will you feel emboldened to threaten to ""beat the living diversity?"" out of them?

And if you want to expose your good-for-nothing brother-in-law for the neer-do-well that he is, you could sneer at him that he is a pathetic waste of ""science-based climate change."" Think of this as a two-for-one insult.

What is truly remarkable about the CDC censorship is that it was the (to put it loosely) brainchild of supposed adults who are charged with overseeing the health of the country who prevented scientists from speaking in scientific terms.

Its almost as if a massive federal bureaucracy has been taken over by Monty Pythons knights who say ""Ni!""",18/12/2017
Tampa Bay Times,CDC chief disputes reports of banned words,"ATLANTA  A list of words shorter than a spelling test has caused a national political stir.

There were reports last week that analysts at the nations top public health agency, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta, were given a list of forbidden words.

Senior agency budget officials reportedly said they were not to use the words in preparing the next years budget documents. It emerged that similar prohibitions existed at other federal health offices.

The words included some that advocates argue are core to the mission of public health: ""vulnerable,"" ""entitlement,"" ""diversity,"" ""transgender,"" ""fetus,"" ""evidence-based"" and ""science-based.""

According to the Washington Post, instead of ""evidence-"" or ""science-based,"" one suggested substitution was: ""CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes.""

Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual people, said, ""This is incredibly disturbing.""

Social media is hot with commentary on the story, Graham said, and his group is promising to get phone banks calling congressional offices.

""Some folks were thinking they could do this without garnering much attention; clearly, that has not happened,"" Graham said.

The CDCs new director, Brenda Fitzgerald of Georgia, responded to the furor Sunday.

""I want to assure you there are no banned words at CDC,"" she tweeted. ""We will continue to talk about all our important public health programs.""

Still, the report that the words, which might have negative connotations for GOP politicians, were not to be used in the annual request to Congress for money drew ire.

Scientists and advocates said the best interpretation of the events was still problematic. Congress, more than anyone, needs to hear true, accurately descriptive words about public health, they said.

""Congress is going to be making policy about information coming from the government agencies,"" said Art Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center. ""Whether its about reproduction or flu vaccination or the health impacts of climate change. They have their hand on the pocketbook, and they need to be guided by the best evidence possible.""

Dr. Wendy Armstrong, a nationally recognized public health expert on HIV/AIDS, added that ""the use of words like science-based, evidence-based and words to describe subsets of individuals that have unique health experiences, like transgender, fetus, vulnerable, etc., are necessary.""

She said ""censoring or discouraging their use impairs our ability as physicians and scientists to protect the individual health and the public health of Americans.""

Caplan cautioned not to be fooled into thinking the limited discouragement of their use wouldnt have a larger effect.

""If somebody sends up a message from HHS or somewhere saying, You know, itd be better in terms of dealing with Congress if we make up words and dont use things like evidence, itll go farther.

""You dont have to issue a mandate,"" Caplan said. ""You made your point. People heard you.""

""From the very beginning, this administration has dealt in fake news and alternative facts, so it is no surprise that it would impose language restrictions on agency employees,"" said U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga. ""Censorship and the propaganda that results is dangerous. It smacks of what totalitarian regimes do to obfuscate the truth.""

The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement suggesting nothing important had changed: ""The assertion that HHS has banned words is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process.""",18/12/2017
Tampa Bay Times,"CDC gets list of forbidden words: fetus,’ transgender,’ evidence-based’","Trump administration officials are forbidding officials at the nations top public health agency from using a list of seven words or phrases - including ""fetus"" and ""transgender"" - in any official documents being prepared for next years budget.

Policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were told of the list of forbidden words at a meeting Thursday with senior CDC officials who oversee the budget, according to an analyst who took part in the 90-minute briefing. The forbidden words are: ""vulnerable,"" ""entitlement,"" ""diversity,"" ""transgender,"" ""fetus,"" ""evidence-based"" and ""science-based.""

In some instances, the analysts were given alternative phrases. Instead of ""science-based"" or ""evidence-based,"" the suggested phrase is ""CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes,"" the person said. In other cases, no replacement words were immediately offered.

The question of how to address such issues as sexual orientation, gender identity and abortion rights - all of which received significant visibility under the Obama administration - has surfaced repeatedly in federal agencies since President Donald Trump took office. Several key departments - including Health and Human Services, which oversees CDC, as well as Justice, Education and Housing and Urban Development - have changed some federal policies and how they collect government information about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.

In March, for example, HHS dropped questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in two surveys of elderly people.

HHS has also removed information about LGBT Americans from its website. The departments Administration for Children and Families, for example, archived a page that outlined federal services that are available for LGBT people and their families, including how they can adopt and receive help if they are the victims of sex trafficking.

At the CDC, the meeting about the banned words was led by Alison Kelly, a senior leader in CDCs Office of Financial Services, according to the CDC analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Kelly did not say why the words are being banned, according to the analyst, and told the group that she was merely relaying the information.

Other CDC officials confirmed the existence of a list of forbidden words. Its likely that other parts of HHS are operating under the same guidelines regarding the use of these words, the analyst said.

At the CDC, several offices have responsibilities for work that uses some of these words. The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention is working on ways to prevent HIV among transgender people and reduce health disparities. The CDCs work on birth defects caused by the Zika virus, for example, includes research on the developing fetus.

The ban is related to the budget and supporting materials that are to be given to CDCs partners and to Congress, the analyst said. The presidents budget for 2019 is expected to be released in early February. The budget blueprint is generally shaped to reflect an administrations priorities.

Federal agencies are sending in their budget proposals to the Office of Management and Budget, which has authority about what is included.

Neither an OMB spokesman nor a CDC spokeswoman responded to requests for comment Friday.

The longtime CDC analyst, whose job includes writing descriptions of the CDCs work for the administrations annual spending blueprint, could not recall a previous time when words were banned from budget documents because they were considered controversial.

The reaction of people in the meeting was ""incredulous,"" the analyst said. ""It was very much, Are you serious? Are you kidding? ""

""In my experience, weve never had any pushback from an ideological standpoint,"" the analyst said.

News of the ban on certain words hasnt yet spread to the broader group of scientists at the CDC, but its likely to provoke a backlash, the analyst said. ""Our subject matter experts will not lay down quietly - this hasnt trickled down to them yet.""

The CDC has a budget of about $7 billion and more than 12,000 employees working across the nation and around the globe on everything from food and water safety to heart disease and cancer to infectious disease outbreak prevention. Much of the CDCs work has strong bipartisan support.

Kelly told the analysts that ""certain words"" in the CDCs budget drafts were being sent back to the agency for corrections. Three words that had been flagged in these drafts were ""vulnerable,"" ""entitlement"" and ""diversity."" Kelly told the group she had been authorized to give verbal instructions about the remaining banned words.",16/12/2017
Tampa Bay Times,HCSO continues homeless outreach efforts,"BRANDON  A cool crisp breeze swept through the morning grounds of the New Hope Methodist Church as individuals stood in line wearing sweatshirts, jeans and other warm attire as they waited to receive assistance.

Deputies from the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office and Tampa Police Department officers joined together, along with 75 volunteers and more than 20 vendors during the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office Homeless Initiative outreach event on Tuesday (Dec. 12).

""This event brought community members from various organizations together with a purpose for individuals to get services all in one location,"" HCSO Dep. Stephanie Krager said. ""We selected different areas in the county to spread it out.""

A variety of providers, from Metro Wellness and Community Centers to The Salvation Army to CareerSource Tampa Bay offered services to many. For instance, Metro Wellness and Community Centers offered free HIV testing.

The West Tampa Memorial American Legion Post 248 donated 14 bicycles, which were raffled off. These bicycles came with a lock as well.

In order to qualify for the raffle or any other free item such as clothes, blankets, food, toiletries and more, participants had to check-in at the registration table. They also received a passport, which needed a total of 12 signatures from any of the resources present.

More than 100 homeless individuals attended. Those who came had many reasons as to why they chose to be here.

James Peppers, 56, spoke with one of the deputies about his situation of being homeless in hopes that he could soon create a better life for himself.

""I need a solid roof over my head and a good job."" Peppers said.

Said 57-year-old recipient Joe Carnes: ""Anyone of these officers here can help people with homeless recovery.""

CareerSource Tampa Bay Program Coordinator for the Military Family and Employment Advocacy Program Mario Rodriquez mentioned that their services deal with veterans who might encounter a barrier to employment.

""Our focus here would be for homeless veterans as we provide them links to training or employment if they already obtain the skills set,"" Rodriquez said.

In the final assessment, HCSO officials came away pleased with the involvement.

""Overall, I am just appreciative for all of the volunteers and vendors that came out,"" Deputy Krager said.

Just another foot washing ashore

Another human foot has been found on British Columbias coastline, the 13th such grim discovery since 2007. Police said a man was walking on the beach in Jordan River on Vancouver Island when his dog found the foot in a shoe with part of the leg attached this month. The B.C. Coroners Service is investigating, and a spokesman said an early analysis suggests the remains are human and foul play isnt suspected. Eight of the past discovered feet belong to six people, analysis shows, and police say theres no evidence they were removed by force. Experts say when a body is submerged in the ocean, the arms, legs, hands, feet and head are usually what detach.

Abbas: U.N. should replace U.S. as mediator

Breaking with years of courting the U.S., Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Wednesday for the United Nations to replace Washington as a Mideast mediator and suggested he might not cooperate with the Trump administrations much-anticipated but seemingly remote effort to hammer out an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. At a summit, Arab and Muslim leaders ""rejected and condemned"" U.S. President Donald Trumps recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital  the trigger for Abbas policy pivot  but stopped short of backing his more combative approach.

Myanmar

2 Reuters journalists arrested over papers

Reuters news agency called on Myanmar to immediately release its two journalists who were arrested for possessing ""important secret papers related to the security forces"" obtained from two policemen who had worked in Rakhine state. Violence there widely blamed on security forces, and condemned by the United Nations as ""ethnic cleansing,"" has forced more than 625,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to flee into neighboring Bangladesh. The Ministry of Information said Wednesday the journalists and policemen will be charged under colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries penalties of up to 14 years in prison. Reuters said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been missing since late Tuesday night. ""We are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom,"" Reuters said. The military, which is charge of security in northern Rakhine, and the civilian government have barred most journalists and international observers from independently traveling to the region. The U.S. Embassy said it was ""deeply concerned by the highly irregular arrests."" Press advocates and human rights activists expressed concern that the arrests were part of a recent crackdown on press freedom.

United Kingdom

Lawmakers gain veto power on Brexit deal

British lawmakers upended Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit plans Wednesday by giving Parliament the final say on any exit agreement the government reaches with the European Union. The House of Commons voted 309-305 to insert Parliament in the already strained Brexit process, dealing a blow to Mays already fragile authority. Several lawmakers from the prime ministers governing Conservative Party sided with the opposition to insist any withdrawal deal with the EU requires an Act of Parliament to take effect  essentially giving lawmakers a veto on Brexit. This vote was the governments first defeat in Parliament on its Brexit legislation.

Congo

12 get life sentences for gang-raping children

In a groundbreaking trial in a country where sexual violence is rampant and perpetrators often go unpunished, a military court on Wednesday sentenced 12 militia members to life in prison for the gang-rapes of dozens of children as young as 11 months old, and for murder. The court convicted provincial deputy Frederic Batumike, a member of Parliament, for organizing the violence that began in 2013 and continued for years in the village of Kavumu. Young girls were raped in the militia members belief that it would make them ""impervious to bullets,"" a United Nations report says. The court awarded $5,000 to each victim of sexual violence and $15,000 to the families of those killed for criticizing the militias actions.

Brazil

Free preventative drug to help fight HIV spike

Seeking to stem a sharp rise in HIV cases among young people, Brazil is offering a drug that can prevent infection to those deemed at high risk. Brazil is the first country in Latin America to adopt the pill Truvada  under PrEP, short for pre-exposure prophylaxis  as an integral part of its preventive health care policy. The daily blue pill will be free to eligible Brazilians in 22 cities during an inaugural phase of the program. The Health Ministry is paying U.S. manufacturer Gilead Sciences about 75 cents a dose, a fraction of the price users pay in the U.S., where the pill sells for upward of $1,600 for a months supply.  tbt* wires",13/12/2017
Tampa Bay Times,"Driven by demand, Planned Parenthood opens second clinic in Tampa","The floor-to-ceiling glass windows are heavily tinted and the inside is hidden behind rows of curtains. Security cameras monitor every corner, and only patients with an appointment and valid identification can pass through the intentionally cramped entrance area. A receptionist sits behind a glass window. The more comfortable waiting room is through the next locked door.

The small sign above this new health clinic reads: Planned Parenthood.

Its a politically charged name these days, given the current state of health care in America, and the many attempts in recent years to de-fund the national nonprofit organization known for its reproductive and womens health care services, including abortions. Protesters and violence against Planned Parenthood doctors and staff are not uncommon.

But despite all this, Planned Parenthood just opened its second health center in Hillsborough County. It sits in a nondescript shopping plaza off a busy stretch of Bearss Avenue, sandwiched between an orthodontist office, a veterinary center and a pizza place.

Hillsborough is only the second county in the Central and Southwest Florida chapter with two such centers, thanks to growing demand for patient services in the Tampa Bay area, said Dr. Suzie Prabhakaran, vice president of medical affairs for Planned Parenthood in Florida. The new North Tampa clinic, which opened in October, also will serve patients from Pasco and Polk counties, two regions that Planned Parenthood has identified as among the most in need because of high rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, and poor access to abortion providers.

Hillsborough County had the highest rates of HIV contraction in the state, according to state health department data from 2015. At the time, Florida saw the sharpest spike in the number of new HIV diagnoses in the nation. In addition, diagnoses of other STDs like chlamydia continue to be more common in the Tampa Bay area than other parts of the state.

Like many other health care providers, Planned Parenthood experienced a surge in patients after passage of the Affordable Care Act, though the organization is known for offering low rates for services to those with or without access to insurance.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Florida seeing highest number of new HIV cases in the nation

Orange County, which serves the Orlando metro area, is the only other region in the chapter with two Planned Parenthood clinics. The Palm Beach and Miami areas have multiple clinics.

""We were on a two-week wait for appointments at the other clinic in Tampa,"" said Julia Chueh, health center manager at the new Planned Parenthood location at 246 E. Bearss Ave. The other clinic is located at 8068 N. 56th St. in Tampa. Theres also one at 33 Sixth St. S in St. Petersburg.

The new location is minutes away from the Tampa campus of the University of South Florida, using Interstate 275, Chueh said.

""USF has its own student health services but some people might want more privacy than that, which we can give them here,"" she said. ""Its important to us that patients feel safe here.""

For years, Planned Parenthood has come under fire from religious and politically conservative groups for its abortion services. Because of Floridas gun-friendly climate and general opposition to abortion, the organization has become more focused on security.

In contrast to the closed-off exterior, the inside of the clinic is bright and colorful. Contemporary furniture lines the edges of the waiting room. On the walls are photos of smiling faces that suggest a diverse group of patients, from women of all races, to people of all sexual and gender identities and income levels. Signs around the office and all pamphlets are written in English and Spanish.

Many services and prescriptions are available the same day as a patients scheduled appointment.

""People have this perception of Planned Parenthood, which most of the time is just not the case. Its important for people to know the high quality of care we provide, yes, at a low cost, but all physicians here are board certified and keep up with the most recent data,"" Prabhakaran said. ""I think patients are surprised when theyre first referred to us.""

There are two sizeable exam rooms and a recovery bay with several reclining chairs in the new Tampa clinic. The clinic has its own laboratory and several rooms and offices where patients can talk to Planned Parenthood doctors or counselors, or just breast feed in private. Patients waiting in recovery can watch Netflix from provided Amazon Kindles or enjoy the free Wifi.

Two doctors man the Tampa center, which offers a wide range of reproductive health services. That includes abortion, routine gynecological services like birth control prescriptions, cancer screenings and transgender hormone therapy. Every patient is screened by trained staff for intimate partner violence, Chueh said.

And Planned Parenthood still gives out free condoms.

""The biggest issue I see in Tampa Bay is that sex is still so stigmatized,"" said Linnea Dewees, a community health educator with Planned Parenthood who works generally in local high schools and middle schools. ""Most of my job is just coaching young people through their options and reminding them that we exist.""

Tampa Bay Times,"LEAD program builds medical bridge between Tampa, developing countries","TAMPA  Inside a nondescript conference room at Tampa General Hospital on Dec. 7, the face of global health was changing.

Sixteen physicians from the cities of Lanzhou and Guigang, China, surrounded by American snacks and coffee mugs bearing the University of South Florida Health logo, took notes from a PowerPoint slideshow about leadership written in Chinese and English.

Dr. John Sinnott, chairman of USF Internal Medicine, paused between sentences to allow a translator to speak.

""Your hospital should be constantly measuring infections in hospital rooms and always improving,"" he said. ""Do you understand?""

The presentation was one of many given throughout the year by Sinnotts Leadership Enhancement and Development program, or LEAD, which partners Tampa General with USF Health to bring the knowledge of senior American hospital administrators to medical centers in developing countries like China, Thailand and Panama.

""Chinese hospitals do not have CEOs with masters degrees, so as physicians they really dont have access to leadership skills,"" said Dr. Lynette Menezes, USF Health Internationals assistant vice president and assistant dean of USF Medicine International.

""Many of the doctors who have come here and trained with us are now leading their hospitals as vice presidents or department chairs.""

The LEAD program was created in 2000, when Sinnott and Menezes traveled to India to train more than 150 physicians to better manage the HIV epidemic that was sweeping the country at that time, bringing some of the doctors back to the U.S. to learn prevention and treatment strategies.

In 2009, doctors from the city of Lanzhou, which had embarked on a project to expand its medical infrastructure, visited Tampa General and liked what they saw enough to sign an official agreement.

One year later, the first group of hospital administrators arrived in Tampa to learn how to run their new centers.

Over the last four years, Lanzhou has built nine 2,000-bed hospitals, and the LEAD program has brought prestige in global medicine to both Tampa General and USF Health.

USF President Judy Genshaft has accompanied Sinnott on several trips. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn went on one of 2016s trips to help establish an official sister-city relationship between Lanzhou and Tampa.

""Diseases dont know borders anymore,"" Sinnott said. ""My doctors here need to know whats happening, for example, in India, and Indian doctors need to know whats happening here. And these doctors go home and talk about what a wonderful hospital Tampa General is.""

Sinnott estimated that the visiting doctors hotel stays, which they pay for in addition to their income-based tuition for the program, accounts for about 9,000 nights into Tampas economy.

The doctors now visiting stay at the new West Wing Boutique Hotel on Fowler Avenue, where they like to swim after a long day of learning and enjoy shopping and dinner on their own at local restaurants. One of them is Hong Kong House, which they said has ""awesome"" food.

""Tampa is a very beautiful city, near the sea,"" said Dr. Nan Wang, a cardiologist who has been to the United States once before to study at Emory University in Atlanta. ""The weather is very comfortable!""

Menezes said that about 50 percent of the doctors who participate in LEAD are women, and most are between the ages of 30 and 40  demonstrating a gradual shift to a new generation of hospital leaders.

""I know the U.S. is getting better at this, because we see a lot more females in our medical schools,"" she said. ""But I feel from my visits to China that there is a lot more gender equality when it comes to women in leadership roles.""

Sinnott said he uses ""a fair amount"" of his own money for program expenses, and Menezes spends her evenings and weekends making the dozens of phone calls required to keep a global health initiative running. The physicians dont earn extra pay for running the LEAD program.

""One of the most satisfying things to me is to do something for someone with no expectation that you would ever be paid back for it,"" said Sinnott. ""Youre just doing it for altruistic reasons, and that is really why people go into medicine.""

Tampa Bay Times,Anglican minister urges prayers for Britain’s Prince George to be gay,"LONDON  A prominent Anglican cleric and gay rights campaigner known for contentious gestures has urged believers to pray for Prince George  age 4, and third in line to the throne  to find the love ""of a fine young gentleman"" when he grows up so as to advance the cause of same-sex marriage in church.

Coming just days after Prince Harry  Georges uncle, and fifth in line  announced his engagement to Meghan Markle, a divorced American actress, the suggestion by the Very Rev. Kelvin Holdsworth seemed to illuminate once more the role of royal romance in Britains imagination and conversation, especially when it collides with tradition.

Prince Harry and Markle have said they will marry in May at St. Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle, west of London. But it is only since 2002 that the Church of England has permitted church marriages for divorced people, ""in exceptional circumstances"" at the discretion of parish priests. The church teaching is that marriage is for life.

While same-sex marriage is permitted by law in most of Britain, the Church of England says on its website, ""it remains the case that it is not legally possible for same-sex couples to marry"" in its churches.

Holdsworth, the provost of St. Marys Cathedral in Glasgow, belongs to the Scottish Episcopal Church, a separate province of the Anglican Communion that voted in June to let its priests solemnize same-sex marriages.

In his campaign to expand on that change, Holdsworth wrote in a blog post on Thursday that believers could ""pray in the privacy of their hearts (or in public if they dare) for the Lord to bless Prince George with a love, when he grows up, of a fine young gentleman."" Prince George is the elder child of Prince William and the former Catherine Middleton, now called the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

""A royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily, though we might have to wait 25 years for that to happen,"" Holdsworth wrote. ""Who knows whether that might be sooner than things might work out by other means.""

His suggestion was widely reported in the British media on Friday, though the blog on which he made it seemed inaccessible Friday morning.

Holdsworth caused a frisson among some of the faithful in January when he permitted a reading from the Quran during a service that included a rebuttal of the Christian belief that Jesus was the son of God.

His latest comments also drew the outrage of more traditional clerics. The Rev. Gavin Ashenden, a former royal chaplain, called the comments unchristian.

""To pray for Prince George to grow up in that way"" is to ""pray in a way that would disable and undermine his constitutional and personal role,"" he told Christian Today, an online news provider, particularly when part of the expectation that the prince would inherit would be ""to produce a biological heir with a woman he loves.""

""It is an unkind and destabilizing prayer,"" Ashenden continued. ""It is the theological equivalent of the curse of the wicked fairy in one of the fairy tales.""

There was no immediate comment from the royal family. Prince Harry and Markle arrived in Nottingham, England, on Friday for their first official visit together ? to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and youth violence.",01/12/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Contestant from South Africa wins Miss Universe crown,"LAS VEGAS  Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, who represented South Africa, won the Miss Universe crown Sunday.

The 22-year-old, who wants to use her reign to champion HIV/AIDS and self-defense causes, was crowned at The AXIS theater at Planet Hollywood casino-resort on the Las Vegas Strip.

""HIV/AIDS is a very big problem in my country South Africa, so I hope to stand as an advocate for that,"" she said before reporters after the event.

Along with the title, Nel-Peters earned a yearlong salary, a luxury apartment in New York City for the duration of her reign and more prizes. She is the second woman from her home country to earn the crown.

The runner-up was Miss Colombia Laura Gonzalez, while the second runner-up was Miss Jamaica Davina Bennett.

Ninety-two women from around the world participated in the decades-old competition. This years edition had the most contestants ever, including the first representatives in its history of Cambodia, Laos and Nepal.

When asked to name the most important issue women face in the workplace, Nel-Peters said the lack of equal pay.

""In some places, women get paid 75 percent of what men earn for doing the same job, working the same hours, and I do not believe that is right,"" said Nel-Peters, who recently earned a business management degree. ""I think we should have equal work for equal pay for women all over the world.""

Nel-Peters is from the South African coastal community of Sedgefield in the Western Cape province. She helped develop a program to train women in self-defense in various situations after she was robbed at gunpoint a month after she was crowned Miss South Africa.

The subject of sexual harassment against women, which has dominated headlines in the U.S. over the past two months, was raised during the pageant. In response to a question, Jamaicas Bennett said no form of abuse, including sexual harassment, should be tolerated, and any instances of sexual harassment should be brought to authorities.

In the U.S., dozens of politicians, Hollywood executives and actors, and media personalities are facing accusations of sexual misconduct, sparked by a wave of allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

After the show, Nel-Peters said women can empower each other to standup against any abuse.

""You feel so empowered because you are on a stage with 91 other women that are strong, that are independent, that have worked really hard,"" she said. ""They are all winners; they are winners of their own countries, and to me, that was so empowering. That just showed me that if women take hands and stand together, we are unbreakable and we can say no to the things that are wrong in the workplace, at home or wherever you might go.""

Steve Harvey returned as the shows host despite botching the 2015 Miss Universe crowning. On Sunday, he poked fun at his mistake throughout the night. Three days after people in the U.S. celebrated Thanksgiving, Harvey told the audience he is ""grateful for the Oscars,"" referring to the best-picture flub at this years Academy Awards.

Grammy-Award winner Fergie performed her new song ""A Little Work"" while the contestants walked down the stage wearing evening gowns. This years judges included YouTube star Lele Pons, former judge of ""Americas Next Top Model"" Jay Manuel and Wendy Fitzwilliam, the 1998 Miss Universe winner from Trinidad and Tobago.

President Donald Trump offended Hispanics when he made anti-immigrant remarks in announcing his bid for the White House in 2015. At the time, he co-owned The Miss Universe Organization with NBCUniversal, but the network and the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision quickly cut ties with him, refusing to air the show. Trump sued both networks, eventually settling and selling off the entire pageant to talent management company WME/IMG.",27/11/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Some cities faced with all-or-nothing medical marijuana rules are playing it safe,"When it comes to weighing the options for regulating medical marijuana through the law passed this year, Dunedin city commissioners declared local governments face a ""conundrum"" and ""a false dilemma.""

They said they would welcome a dispensary in the city and want residents to have it as an option for chronic pain. They noted how the overwhelming majority, 71 percent statewide and 75 percent in Pinellas County, voted in 2016 to amend the Constitution and legalize medical marijuana for certain illnesses.

But the state law enacted in June gave local governments only two choices for regulating dispensaries: ban them all together or give them the same rules as pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens. Cities are unable to restrict the number of dispensaries or shape zoning rules specifically for medical marijuana.

Facing an all-or-nothing scenario, many governments across Tampa Bay are choosing to prevent dispensaries from opening. Like the Dunedin City Commission, which voted 4-0 last week on first reading to ban the facilities outright, its not always because they are opposed to the concept.

""We believe medical marijuana ought to be available to people,"" Commissioner Maureen Freaney said. ""We were ready to put in place something where somebody can come and open a dispensary in our city. Then the Legislature comes in and basically says hey, all or nothing. Its infuriating, quite frankly.""

After a slew of beach cities including Belleair Bluffs, Madeira Beach and North Redington Beach enacted bans, and others enforced moratoriums to stall through next year, Clearwater voted unanimously last week to allow dispensaries. Indian Rocks Beach was one of the few beach communities to allow dispensaries last month.

Clearwater Mayor George Cretekos said given the citys two options, he could not support banning dispensaries outright since voters made their voices clear with the passage of the Constitutional amendment.

Seven companies were originally approved to grow and dispense medical cannabis in Florida, and 10 more were approved this year. Of the 21 dispensary locations now open in the state, Trulieve has locations in Clearwater, Tampa and St. Petersburg and Surterra Therapeutics has one in Tampa.

As of the most recent count Nov. 8, more than 50,000 patients have signed up through the Florida Department of Health to receive medical marijuana for a list of qualifying illnesses since the registry opened in 2016.

The law lets terminally ill patients buy and use full-strength marijuana in the form of vapor oils, capsules and lotions. Certain other patients, including children with cancer and severe epilepsy, can use low-THC cannabis. Doctors can decide whether to recommend cannabis to patients diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition listed in Amendment 2 passed in 2016, such as Lou Gehrigs disease, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, PTSD and other conditions. The flower used for smoking is not legal in Florida.

Casey Cook, legislative advocate for the Florida League of Cities, said the lack of legal flexibility to shape zoning codes for dispensaries to suit each individual community has been problematic.

He said many cities are expecting the Legislature to come back with changes to the law next year and have leaned on moratoriums to buy time.

""Any sort of one-size-fits-all approach restricts their ability to address policy issues at the local level,"" Cook said. ""Cities in Florida are drastically different depending on where you go. The solution to a problem in Pensacola wouldnt solve that problem in Cutler Bay.""

Ben Pollara, executive director of Florida For Care, founded in 2014 to advocate for the legalization of medical marijuana, said restricting the ability of dispensaries to open restricts patient access.

Driving dozens of miles can be burdensome for patients in need. And although cannabis companies are also licensed to deliver the product to qualified patients, there are still limits.

Pollara said he visited a dispensary in Miami recently and met two patients in the waiting room who had driven 75 miles from Palm Beach County.

""It is wrong-headed on the parts of these communities,"" Pollara said. ""In almost every case, whats best for sick and suffering patients who are authorized under the state Constitution to get medical marijuana after a doctors recommendation is to be able to get it locally.""

Dunedin Mayor Julie Ward Bujalski said because this industry is new, it would have been too drastic to allow dispensaries everywhere a pharmacy is permitted, which would have included downtowns Main Street.

She said ""baby steps"" are important and that the city can re-evaluate the ordinance next year.

""Were all struggling with the same thing,"" she said. ""Were all ready to implement it, and boom, they took all of our rights away.""

Tampa Bay Times,Jeffrey Tambor accused of sexual harassment by his Transparent’ co-star,"""Transparent"" actress Trace Lysette has accused actor Jeffrey Tambor of sexually harassing her on the set of the Amazon series.

Lysettes allegations mark the second time the star, who plays Maura Pfefferman on the critically acclaimed dramedy, has been accused of sexual misconduct. Earlier this month, Tambors former assistant Van Barnes accused the actor of sexual harassment in a private Facebook post, according to Deadline. Tambor vehemently denied those allegations, which Amazon said it would investigate.

Lysette, who plays yoga instructor/dancer Shea on the series, told the Hollywood Reporter that Tambor said he wanted ""to attack"" her ""sexually"" ahead of shooting a memorable Season 2 scene. She also made allegations of inappropriate physical contact.

""He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrust back and forth against my body,"" Lysette told the magazine. ""I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas.""

An Amazon spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter that the ""information will be added to our ongoing investigation."" Tambor issued a lengthy statement to the magazine in response to the allegations.

""For the past four years, Ive had the huge privilege  and huge responsibility  of playing Maura Pfefferman, a transgender woman, in a show that I know has had an enormous, positive impact on a community that has been too long dismissed and misunderstood. Now I find myself accused of behavior that any civilized person would condemn unreservedly. I know I havent always been the easiest person to work with. I can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact. But I have never been a predator  ever. I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone. But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express.""

The accusations against Tambor have dealt a blow to a series lauded for its progressive outlook on gender issues and representation of LGBT characters. Lysettes character has had a particularly groundbreaking arc. In Season 3, Shea  who, like Lysette, is transgender  began a romance with Mauras cisgender son, Josh, and disclosed that she was HIV-positive.

The fourth season of ""Transparent"" premiered in September. In August, Amazon announced that it had renewed the show for a fifth season. (Disclosure: Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns the Washington Post.)

Its unclear if the recent allegations against Tambor will affect the shows production schedule. But Lysette, in her statement to the Hollywood Reporter, urged the company not to cancel the show.

""My hope is that Amazon can find the good in this, and use this as an opportunity, a teachable moment to re-center the other trans characters in this show with the family members instead of just pulling it,"" Lysette said. ""Let our brilliant writers continue to craft something that is entertaining and creates a social change the way they know how. Dont let the trans community suffer for the actions of one cis male actor.""",17/11/2017
Tampa Bay Times,New shingles vaccine touted as a breakthrough for older adults,"Medical researchers and government health policymakers, a cautious lot, normally take pains to keep expectations modest when theyre discussing some new finding or treatment.

They warn about studies limitations. They point out what isnt known. They emphasize that correlation doesnt mean causation.

So its startling to hear prominent experts sound positively excited about a new shingles vaccine that an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved last month.

""This really is a sea change,"" said Dr. Rafael Harpaz, a veteran shingles researcher at the CDC.

Dr. William Schaffner, preventive disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said, ""This vaccine has spectacular initial protection rates in every age group. The immune system of a 70- or 80-year-old responds as if the person were only 25 or 30.""

""This really looks to be a breakthrough in vaccinating older adults,"" agreed Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a physician and researcher at the National Institutes of Health.

Whats causing the enthusiasm: Shingrix, which pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline intends to begin shipping this month. Large international trials have shown that the vaccine prevents more than 90 percent of shingles cases, even at older ages.

The currently available shingles vaccine, called Zostavax, only prevents about half of shingles cases in those older than 60 and has demonstrated far less effectiveness among elderly patients.

Yet those are the people most at risk for this blistering disease, with its often intense pain, its threat to vision and the associated nerve pain that sometimes last months, even years, after the initial rash fades.

Almost all older Americans harbor the varicella zoster virus that causes shingles; they acquired it with childhood chickenpox, whether they knew they had the disease or not.

The virus stays dormant until, for unknown reasons, it erupts decades later. The risk rises sharply after age 50.

Shingles is hardly a minor menace. ""A million cases occur in the United States each and every year,"" Schaffner said. ""If youre fortunate enough to reach your 80th birthday, you stand a 1-in-3 to 1-in-2 chance of shingles.""

Preventing the great majority of these cases along with the risk of lingering and debilitating nerve pain, called postherpetic neuralgia, would represent a major advance in public health.

So while the old vaccine will remain on the market, the CDC committee voted to make Shingrix the preferred vaccine and recommended it for all adults older than 50, a group younger by a decade than those earlier encouraged to get Zostavax.

The committee also recommended Shingrix for adults who have previously gotten Zostavax, since a smaller study in people older than 65 demonstrated effectiveness and safety in those already vaccinated. The Food and Drug Administration approved Shingrix last month.

Once the CDCs director endorses the committees recommendations, and the agency publishes them, insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, will start covering the vaccine.

""By early 2018, it should be broadly available to consumers in the U.S.,"" said Dr. Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines. (Canada has also approved Shingrix; it awaits approval in Australia, Japan and Europe.)

What makes the new vaccine so promising, especially for older adults?

It provides better protection against shingles from the start. Though Zostavax, introduced in 2006, can reduce shingles cases by about half (and postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds), that overall rate conceals big differences by age.

That vaccines effectiveness drops from 64 percent for people in their 60s to 38 percent among those older than 70, and falls still lower for people in their 80s.

But the new vaccine protects nearly as well in older groups as in the middle-age. Shingrix racked up a 97 percent effectiveness rate in adults older than 50 and, in a separate study of people older than 70, prevented 90 percent of shingles in those 70 to well past age 80.

""In groups such as the elderly, who often dont maintain vigorous responses to vaccines, this represents extremely strong disease protection,"" said Dr. Kathleen Dooling, an epidemiologist at the CDC.

Shingrixs protection appears to last longer. Among seniors, the effectiveness of Zostavax wanes with disappointing speed. ""After 11 years, the protection was close to zero,"" Harpaz said.

Regulators dont yet have 11 years of data on Shingrix, but in some samples, it remained effective for six years or longer, according to GSK. That should greatly reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, too, assuming the 42 million people in their 50s start getting vaccinated.

The new vaccine may protect people with compromised immune systems.

A substantial number of older Americans have suppressed immunity because theyre undergoing chemotherapy or transplants, have HIV or take steroids. For them, the previous vaccine was off-limits because it was made with a weakened live virus.

Yet immune suppression itself leaves the people vulnerable to shingles. Shingrix, a recombinant vaccine made from a glycoprotein and a combination of immunity boosters called adjuvants, doesnt pose the same danger.

The CDC committee held off on recommending Shingrix for the immunocompromised, because GSK is still running trials with these patients. But since the FDA did not declare Shingrix contraindicated for them when approving it, they can get the vaccine once its available.

Public health advocates do foresee a couple of potential problems.

First, Shingrix requires two doses, administered at least two months apart. Prodding the older population to get a single shot has proved tough: Barely 31 percent of those older than 60 have been vaccinated against shingles. How much harder will it be to persuade people to get two Shingrix injections?

Further, ""it tends to be a bit of an ouch-y vaccine,"" Schaffner cautioned.

In studies, most older recipients said theyd experienced pain, redness or swelling in their upper arms for a day or two after the shot, and 8.5 percent of those older than 70 deemed those symptoms uncomfortable enough to interfere with normal activities.

About half of those older than 70 reported more systemic side effects like fatigue, fever or aching joints, lasting one to two days. Physicians and pharmacists should prepare people for such reactions, Schaffner said.

""If people anticipate it, theyll cope with it better. Theyll take a couple of Tylenol"" and not worry that something is seriously wrong.

They may feel pocketbook pain, too. Zostavax is the most expensive adult vaccine, and at $140 for each dose (plus the cost of administering the injection), Shingrix will be pricier still.

The 50- to 65-year-old cohort, many of whom have coverage under employee health plans, may not find that much of a barrier. At older ages, cost matters more.

Medicare will cover Shingrix under Part D (like its predecessor), not under Part B like the flu vaccine. That complicates reimbursement for those seeking vaccination in doctors offices, so Medicare patients will probably find it simpler to head for a pharmacy.

But not all Medicare recipients have Part D, and those that do could face copayments.

Still, its no contest: The hazards of shingles and its complications dwarf any problems yet reported with Shingrix.

""Compared to shingles, a little arm pain for a day or so is a small price to pay,"" Schaffner said. ""If you know people whove had this illness, youll be first in line for this vaccine.""",17/11/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Analysis: FEMA has rejected appeals worth $1.2B over the past decade,"As U.S. communities ravaged by this year's series of intense hurricanes and wildfires clear debris and begin to rebuild, many are counting on the federal government to help cover their costs. They could be in for a frustrating surprise.

If history is any guide, some local governments and nonprofit organizations could get less than they were told to expect from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Others could be asked years from now to repay some or all of the aid they received, if FEMA concludes the projects failed to comply with its voluminous requirements or decides it shouldn't have approved the payouts in the first place.

Over the past decade, FEMA's denials and reversals have caused uncertainty and anger in some communities, led to long rounds of appeals, strained local budgets, made it hard for some organizations to stay afloat, and occasionally delayed the rebuilding process.

""My word of advice for everybody is document, document, document,"" warned a frustrated Mayor Orlando Lopez of Sweetwater, Florida. ""Cross your t's, dot your i's and back up everything.""

On Aug. 15, FEMA denied an appeal from the Miami suburb and said it must repay $2 million it received nearly two decades ago to repair storm damage because it failed to adequately document work done. Lopez called FEMA's actions ""completely and utterly unfair."" A few weeks after the denial, Sweetwater suffered a fresh round of damage from Hurricane Irma.

For its part, FEMA is legally obligated to look out for the taxpayers' money and guard against misuse and fraud by local governments and organizations that overcharge the federal government or use emergency aid to undertake long-desired improvements they couldn't otherwise afford.

Christopher Logan, FEMA's public assistance director, said in the agency's defense that major disasters can result in ""extremely complex, technically complicated projects that span many, many years."" But he said the agency has recently taken steps to reduce what he called misunderstandings.

An analysis by The Associated Press found that over the past decade, FEMA headquarters has denied appeals for at least $1.2 billion sought by local governments and nonprofit groups to protect or rebuild communities hit by hurricanes, floods, fires, earthquakes, tornadoes or other major disasters.

The AP reviewed more than 900 final appeal rulings. In one-third of those cases, FEMA granted some or all of the requested funding, totaling about $250 million. Two-thirds of the appeals were rejected, probably totaling well more than the $1.2 billion tallied by the AP because the amounts denied were unclear in FEMA's online records for more than 100 cases.

The money at stake in those cases was just a tiny fraction of the tens of billions of dollars FEMA paid out during that period. Yet the disputes may offer a glimpse of some of the challenges communities struck by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate could face in the years and even decades ahead.

The AP's review found that FEMA has argued with local governments and nonprofits — and faced disagreements within its own ranks — over hundreds of matters big and small: whether buildings should be repaired or replaced; whether certain damage was caused by a disaster or by pre-existing problems; even whether tree stumps were the proper size to qualify for removal using federal aid.

Among the appeals squelched by FEMA: Florida's attempt to get $51 million it claimed to have lost by waiving tolls for motorists evacuating from eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005.

FEMA's final decisions sometimes come long after a disaster has struck, and even well after the money has been spent.

The agency also has repeatedly rejected funding requests based on the applicant's failure to appeal within the required 60 days — even though FEMA acknowledges that it routinely exceeds its own 90-day legal deadline to rule on appeals.

FEMA's Logan said the agency recently overhauled its disaster operations to provide each applicant with a single contact person and more information about the potential pitfalls in seeking federal aid.

The goal, he said, ""is to help them understand what we can pay for and what we can't pay for — so that we set the expectations up front so we don't have those kind of misunderstandings.""

FEMA officials acknowledge the agency has done a poor job of resolving appeals quickly. In 2014, just 6 percent of appeals to FEMA headquarters were decided within the law's 90-day requirement. That is up to 26 percent this year, agency officials said.

Hurricane Katrina alone accounted for one out every seven appeals over the past decade. The storm illustrates how FEMA's rulings can occasionally be financially devastating to groups and individuals and have long-lasting effects on communities.

""FEMA dropped us like a hot potato,"" said Dimitre Blutcher of Harvey, Louisiana, former executive director of N'R Peace, a nonprofit organization that helps people with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases get medical treatment.

Her group's HIV clinic and main office were devastated by flooding and winds from Katrina in 2005. Days after the storm, she said, FEMA asked her to continue providing services to clients. FEMA paid the group $105,600 for its work, which included the long process of reconstructing clients' files after the paper records were destroyed.

Blutcher said FEMA and state officials led her to believe the clinic would qualify for additional money, so she took out a bank loan and line of credit while awaiting reimbursement for her costs, which grew to $280,000.

But FEMA reversed course in 2011, saying it would not provide any more reimbursement and ordering the group to repay the initial $105,600, too. The clinic soon closed its doors.

""They didn't care that they promised us the money and we spent it. They didn't care that I took out a line of credit to keep services going,"" Blutcher said. ""All they cared about was that people with HIV and other diseases got care, and then they refused to pay us several years later. How can any human do that?""

Rejecting the group's final appeal in 2013, a FEMA administrator concluded that the cost of replacing destroyed medical files did not qualify for federal aid. The agency dismissed the group's argument that it shouldn't be punished for an error made by a lower-level FEMA official.

The Northridge earthquake shook Southern California in 1994, setting off a lengthy rebuilding process. Fifteen years later, FEMA headquarters was still deciding about a dozen appeals over funding. In some of those cases, FEMA was seeking to recoup millions of dollars that had been questioned after the fact by the agency's auditors.

Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, about 35 miles north of Los Angeles, received $21.5 million from FEMA for repairs. But that fell far short of the roughly $35 million the hospital said it needed to fix the two-story facility in line with California's new earthquake codes.

The 217-bed hospital eventually sought bankruptcy protection, blaming the underfunded project. Then in 2004, FEMA asked it to give back $2.1 million, saying the work exceeded the scope of the original agreement or lacked documentation justifying the costs.

The hospital went through the full two rounds of appeals, first at the FEMA regional office, then at FEMA headquarters, and lost. Hospital President and CEO Roger Seaver said it still hasn't repaid FEMA.

""You're struggling, you're putting people on payment plans ... getting new loans at high interest rates, paying the bankruptcy costs,"" he said. ""Then here comes the government back to help us again by taking back money.""",15/10/2017

How serial killers think: Mindhunter

Among the sinister offerings this month is Netflix's serial killer drama Mindhunter. The 1979-set FBI series is based on the 1996 book Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit by John Douglas and follows two agents (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) who interview imprisoned murderers in an attempt to understand how they think and hopefully use that information to solve ongoing crimes. In the trailer, psychologist Wendy (Anna Torv) tells the agents, ""Psychopaths are convinced that there is nothing wrong with them, so these men are virtually impossible to study, yet you have found a way in near-perfect laboratory conditions."" Sounds like the agents are going to be delving into investigative techniques beyond the simple one-on-one interview. True crime junkies will dig into this new series set during a time when real serial killers David Berkowitz and Charles Manson shot to notoriety. Now available on Netflix.

Tampa Bay Times,Review: BBC's 'Queers' an intimate look at decades of gay British life,"The recent BBC series Queers is a deceivingly simple take on decades of gay life in Britain. One pub. One character. 20 minutes.

The eight episodes were produced to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act, which partially decriminalized sex between men. (That doesn't mean gay people weren't still criminalized, though.)

But far from simple, each intimate episode focuses on complex lives in poetic monologues from actors who become their roles so well it's easy to forget their star names. Director Mark Gatiss (Sherlock) filled the cast with Fionn Whitehead (Dunkirk), Kadiff Kirwan (Black Mirror), Gemma Whelan (Game of Thrones), Alan Cumming (Battle of the Sexes), Ben Whishaw (London Spy), Russell Tovey (Quantico), Ian Gelder (Game of Thrones) and Rebecca Front (Humans).



The performances quietly draw you in, indeed treating you as the only other soul in the pub for a friend's confessional - anxious, angry, solemn, triumphant, sexy. It's essentially a high-quality theater show brought to the small screen, often with the 20 minutes passing quickly. The piano score provides a soft, cozy atmosphere in the pub where past LGBTQ patrons fade away.



The characters - crafted by new and established screenwriters Matthew Baldwin, Jon Bradfield, Michael Dennis, Keith Jarrett, Gareth McLean, Jackie Clune, Brian Fillis and Gatiss - don't blatantly say ""I'm gay."" Instead, the body language those of us in the LGBTQ community know so well is on full display. A ""certain liquidity of the eye,"" the curl of a lip. And then, of course, the exuberance that spreads across the face while sparing no sexy talk.



And there's quite a bit of that, more open descriptions of queer longing and sexual acts than you'd hear or see on most American television.



In ""Safest Spot in Town,"" Kirwan - the only actor of color in the series - as 1941's Fredrick is a pure delight as he remarks ""Oh my god, if their overalls could speak"" and later ""he tasted of the suburbs, like he had a Hammersmith wife waiting for him at the back of his throat"" to describe an air raid warden during the Blitz. Fredrick then employs a sublime metaphor for a spot that for decades has been loaded with shame and derogatory jokes: He calls ""the lavatories around Piccadilly where men who speak my language like to entertain each other"" the theater.



Then in ""The Perfect Gentleman,"" Whelan as 1929's genderqueer Bobby plays with pronouns: ""She is not what he seems, and she, as he, can rattle around as he pleases,"" cheekily adding: ""One can carry on being a cake-eater till one has had one's fill. Did you clock it?"" Bobby goes on to describe using a candle for an, uh, encounter and the complications of love and lust while dressed as a swaggering gent.



Cumming brings the series into 2016 with ""Something Borrowed,"" a sweet look at groom-to-be Steve (yes, Adam and Steve are getting hitched). Steve anxiously prepares his speech while being cognizant of those who suffered before him as well as the conflict of buying into the straight institution of marriage for LGBTQ folks.



It's hard to imagine many straight people sitting down to watch the series. But does that matter? Plenty of entertainment that talks, jokes or shows PG relationships and explicit sex scenes between straight people never gets questioned about why they're potentially off-putting or alienating to LGBTQ viewers.



And after all, not everything needs to, or should, be for a straight audience.



Despite its compelling performances and refreshing structure, Queers is not perfect television, with one of its weakest episodes - ""A Grand Day Out"" - kicking off the series. (The other weak episode, ""Missing Alice,"" focuses on the wife of a gay man in the 1950s.) Each story narrows in on different gay lives over a century in Britain but mostly focuses on white, gay male experiences. While it shows queer people have existed throughout history in various professions and social statuses, it could have shown more with a diverse cast.



Still, each episode poignantly puts a face to historical injustices. The series connects these characters separated by decades, showing community, love and light can be forged in the darkest of times.



And hopefully, Queers will spark unaware viewers to learn more about the British government and society's handling of the AIDS/HIV crisis, the 1957 Wolfenden Report and the 1967 Sexual Offence Act.

Tampa Bay Times,"Review: More than 20 years later, 'RENT' still matters","TAMPA — Two decades after Rent shook up Broadway with a starkly joyous musical that demanded to be recognized, a nostalgic tour is taking audiences back.

It's a strange concept, the tail end of Generation X already looking back. But so much has changed since Jan. 25, 1996, the debut of Jonathan Larson's play about free-spirited and financially strapped young people living in a New York warehouse, that the timing seems right. Larson never got to see his creation before a Broadway audience; he died earlier that day of an aortic aneurysm.

A thirties-to-fifties crowd filled the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts Tuesday for the 20th anniversary tour of Rent. The Tony- and Pulitzer-winning show based on Puccini's La Boheme has gone down as a game changer, confronting audiences with characters people who can afford the ticket prices might have avoided, and the HIV epidemic that was still killing people left and right.

How much had it aged? Had director Evan Ensign tweaked the show significantly?

Behind those questions lurks the big one: Is Rent still relevant?

The answer was a clear yes for many in the audience, who cheered even at the mere entrance of certain characters (the flamboyant Angel and scatterbrained Maureen were big favorites) and sang to lyrics they knew by heart.

Apart from subtle adjustments in costuming and hairstyles and lighting schemes unavailable in 1996, it's pretty much the same as the film of the stage show in 2008, at the end of its run. The most significant changes come by way Marlies Yearby, the Tony-winning choreographer who returned to launch the tour last year. In a recent phone interview, Yearby told the Times she adapted the movement to the personalities and strengths of actors and did so here.

The broader themes don't need adjustment because they are timeless. Like Scenes From the Life of Bohemia, Henri Murger's 1851 serialized vignettes that inspired the opera, this is about the young. They have boundless energy, they are sometimes more prone to addiction, they create and destroy and steal each other's girlfriends.

Oddly, these young people are also struggling with end-of-life issues, the kind of losses normally reserved for combat soldiers or the elderly. Tenants Mark and Roger are looking at eviction, thanks to their landlord and former pal Benny, who wants to build an upscale art studio there. Sammy Ferber plays Mark, an endearingly befuddled aspiring filmmaker whose parents want him to take a corporate job he's been offered. Ferber, 21, fell in love with Rent in preschool, said his mother, Brenda Aaronson Ferber.

Kaleb Wells makes for a capable if somewhat detached Roger, a rock singer who wants to compose one memorable song before he too dies. He's also part of some nice duets with Mark and also Mimi (Skyler Volpe), a heroin addict and his love interest.

The overdue rent sets up moral dilemmas, from the homeless group that will be displaced by Benny's studio to an extra-legal scheme devised by a professor to get financially well. Collins, the professor played by Aaron Harrington, adds vocal heft in several numbers, such as his newly choreographed signature song, Santa Fe, about his dream of opening a restaurant.

The downside is that too often in this production, individual cast members seem rushed and going through the motions. They lose intensity, they struggle to keep up with a fast, metronomic pace and hit some flat notes. But many times too, individuals step up, take their time and own their space. Thus the show becomes a collection of moments rather than a contiguous whole.

Major kudos go to Lyndie Moe, who shows wonderful comic chops as Maureen Johnson, and whose big voice combines with that of Jasmine Easler, who plays Maureen's partner Joanne in the show's most powerful duet, Take Me or Leave Me. Aaron Alcaraz also delivers as the spunky Angel, Collins' partner who dies on stage and is memorialized. The boldest choreographic change takes place in that scene. Previously Angel simply arose from a gurney-like table, a silky white fabric trailing behind like a bridal train.

That still happens, but first the dying Angel participates in a dance at the center of a circle, surrounded by her friends. The effect is much more exuberant, like the occasion the show commemorates.

CORRECTION: Jonathan Larson died of an aortic aneurysm. An earlier online version of this story gave an incorrect cause of death. Also, Aaron Alcaraz played Angel. An earlier version of the story listed an incorrect last name.

Tampa Bay Times,Hurricanes drive addiction issues into public square,"In the whir of preparations for Hurricane Irma, a needle exchange program in Miami's Overtown neighborhood handed out extra syringes to heroin users. Others trying to break from the drug's grasp picked up advance medication from methadone clinics.

Disasters cause stress, and stress can cause relapse for people struggling with addiction, whether their problem is alcohol, tobacco, pills or heroin. Authorities planning for the devastating effects of hurricanes now factor in the heightened danger of relapse and overdose.

The problems of alcoholism and addiction become more public in a storm, said researcher Andrew Golub of the National Development and Research Institutes in New York, who studied illicit drug users in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

""During a storm, it becomes harder to hide and cope with one's addiction in private,"" Golub said.

Scientists learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy: Drug users took chances during storms, researchers found, avoiding evacuation to stay near their dealers or sharing needles with strangers, putting themselves in danger of HIV and hepatitis. Those in treatment missed doses of medications and went back to street drugs to avoid withdrawal sickness. During Sandy, clinics that lost power measured methadone by candlelight.

""Disasters like this interrupt treatment,"" said Enrique Pouget, whose team interviewed 300 injection drug users in New York after the 2012 storm.

Methadone programs, highly regulated by the government, are required to have disaster emergency plans. The state of Florida, in cooperation with federal authorities, granted methadone clinics discretion to provide up to five days of medication ahead of Hurricane Irma.

Florida's first needle exchange program — aimed at preventing overdoses and blood-borne infections — faces its biggest challenge yet with Irma. This past week, Dr. Hansel Tookes and his team gave away a week's supply of clean needles and overdose reversal kits, or Narcan.

""We want to make sure all of our people have Narcan so they can save lives and be first responders in the storm,"" Tookes said of the 400 drug users who rely on his program . Drug users equipped with Narcan can save others who overdose.

Mark Kinzly, co-founder of the Texas Overdose Naloxone Initiative, said his group distributed around 500 kits to clinics along the Texas coast in the midst of Harvey cleanup. Storms can be disastrous for people with addictions because they interrupt routines and schedules, he said.

""There's people that are going to be without jobs and without homes because of this hurricane,"" Kinzly said. ""They're going to be less stable in their overall lives to begin with. That can be dangerous.""

People in long-term recovery have the ability to cope with disasters, said Julia Negron of Venice, Fla., a former injection drug user and organizer of the Suncoast Harm Reduction Project, a grass roots group working to prevent overdoses.

""You deal with life as it comes. So here you go: Here's a test,"" she said.",09/09/2017

Tampa Bay Times,Florida struggles to keep up with medical pot demand,"The cannabis boom is under way in Florida, and government is struggling to keep up.

Thousands of new patients have sought access to medical marijuana this summer following the passage of a new law expanding the list of maladies that qualify for treatment. Since June 7, the number of patients certified over the entire first three years of Florida’s fledgling cannabis program has nearly doubled from 16,760 to more than 31,000.

But patients are finding it’s one thing to receive a doctor’s certification, and another to receive the state-issued identification card needed to legally place an order. Doctors seeking state-required training through a new course that has yet to be offered are equally frustrated, leading to a growing feeling that the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use and its 12 employees — nine of whom are part-time — are simply overwhelmed.

""I’m not sure the state was prepared,"" said Pete Sessa, chief operating officer of the advocacy-minded Florida Cannabis Coalition.

Right now, the average patient — who might suffer from cancer, HIV, Parkinson’s or other serious illnesses — waits 30 days after applying to receive a medical marijuana card. And that’s if everything goes according to plan.

Tampa Bay Times,"Observations from a liberal, gay, Latino, feminist Florida House freshman","State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, rocked the Florida LGBTA Democratic Caucus dinner at Tallahassee's Hotel Duval Satursday night with his unabashedly liberal and passionate take on the myriad issues he said are key to LGBTQ Floridians. Among them: Access to guns, Reproductive rights, home rule, heathcare. Here are a few nuggets

Republican legislators don't like talking about the Pulse massacre:

""In the Florida legislature I have talked about the tragedy at Pulse night club at length - much to the chagrin of my Republican colleagues. They do not want to talk about Pulse. Why? It makes them feel uncomfortable. It makes them feel uncomfortable because when you invoke the tragedy of Pulse the Republican-controlled Florida legislature they have gun safety, they have to talk about LGBTQ issues, they have to talk about mental health and how Florida's 50th in the nation in funding for mental health, they have to talk about uninsured Latinos - that one in four Latinos living in the state of Florida is uninsured.""

""Richard Corcoran needs to be educated""

With 71 co-sponsors in the legislature for a bill that would protect Floridians from being discriminated against at work, in housing or in public places like restaurants, Smith said there are enough votes to pass the Florida Competetive Workforce Act.

""There are a handful of individuals who control this process. As far as I'm aware, based on the conversations I've seen, Speaker Corcoran needs to be educated on these issues, and I'm planning on educating him,"" Smith said. ""That's one of the reasons why it's so important for us to have a seat at the table, for our community to be there. Because it's so much harder for our colleages to look at me in the face and to look at Rep. David Richardson in the face when they are voting against our community, when they are being openly hostile...saying 'You know what? The Civil Rights Act is for protections based on gender, based on religion, on race, on disabilities, on pregnancy status but it's quite okay for discrimination to take place based on sexual orientation or gender identity.""

Florida's high HIV transmission rate

""It's not a coincidence that we're number one when this year the legislature increased funding for HIV and AIDS programs by .2 percent over last year. It's not a coincidence that we're in that spot when we don't have comprehensive sex education in our schools where teerners are literally being taught, ""Yes kids, abstinence only is the way to not transmit SDIs or create a situation where you might have an uninentended pregnancy. How naive is that? It's more than just naive, it's stupid, and it's irresponsible.""",21/08/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Column: Jurors said they couldn't fairly judge Martin Shkreli in court  and how,"Harper's has published selections from the June transcript of voir dire in the fraud trial of one Martin Shkreli, the famously besmirked pharma bro, wherein prospective jurors were forced to reveal to a judge any biases that might prevent them from making a fair decision in Shkreli's case. He was found guilty earlier this month of three of eight federal criminal charges he faced.

More than 200 people were dismissed from the pile of possible jury members because, it seems, Shkreli's reputation as a smug jerk who price-gouges HIV and cancer patients preceded him. Their in-court explanations are positively healing to read.

""The only thing I'd be impartial about is what prison this guy goes to,"" one juror declared. Said another: ""I don't like this person at all. I just can't understand why he would be so stupid as to take an antibiotic which HIV people need and jack it up 5,000 percent. I would honestly, like, seriously like to go over there …"" ""Sir, thank you,"" the judge interrupted, presumably to protect the potential juror from drawing charges of his own for threatening the defendant.

These hero almost-jurors prove that effective shade need not be complicated nor particularly creative. Some of their simplest phrases are their best. ""I have total disdain for the man""; ""I'm aware of the defendant and I hate him"" — if these people weren't standing before a judge, they would 100 percent be blowing on the tips of their nails, flipping their hair, and flouncing away before their interlocutors could utter another word.

Everything they said — ""he's a greedy little man""; ""he's the most hated man in America"" — is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, but reading the comments as a whole feels even better than truth-telling.

The most honest juror self-disqualifications concern Shkreli's face, which nine out of 10 faceologists (not a real medical specialty) agree is yearning to be knocked around. ""I was looking yesterday in the newspaper and I saw the defendant,"" one person said. ""There was something about him. I can't be fair. There was something that didn't look right.""

Another juror explained that ""when I walked in here today I looked at him, and in my head, that's a snake — not knowing who he was — I just walked in and looked right at him and that's a snake.""

Of course, none of these people made it onto Shkreli's jury, because judges must strive to get a set of 12 people who know as little about the involved parties as possible, and who have no preconceived notions about their innocence or guilt.

That's great for the justice system, but sad for me, because I would very much like to hear more sharp observations from the mind of juror No. 144. ""The question is, have you heard anything that would affect your ability to decide this case with an open mind. Can you do that?"" the judge asked the prospective juror.

""I don't think I can,"" the juror replied, ""because he kind of looks like a d---.""

That kind of well-reasoned argument belongs in every good jury deliberation, or at least in the miniseries adaptation.

Tampa Bay Times,Gene editing spurs hope for transplanting pig organs into humans,"In a striking advance that helps open the door to organ transplants from animals, researchers have created gene-edited piglets cleansed of viruses that might cause disease in humans.

The experiments, reported Thursday in the journal Science, may make it possible one day to transplant livers, hearts and other organs from pigs into humans, a hope that experts had all but given up on.

If pig organs were shown to be safe and effective, ""they could be a real game changer,"" said Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer at the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private, nonprofit organization that manages the nation's transplant system.

There were 33,600 organ transplants last year, and 116,800 patients on waiting lists, according to Klassen, who was not involved in the new study. ""There's a big gap between organ supply and organ demand,"" he said.

Dr. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard who led the experiments, said the first pig-to-human transplants could occur within two years.

The new research combines two great achievements in recent years — gene editing and cloning — and is unfolding quickly. But the work is novel and its course is unpredictable, Klassen noted. It may be years before enough is known about the safety of pig organ transplants to allow them to be used widely.

The idea of using pigs as organ factories has tantalized investigators for decades. Porcine organs can be the right size for human transplantation.

But the prospect also raises thorny questions about animal exploitation and welfare. Already, an estimated 100 million pigs are killed in the United States each year for food.

Scientists pursuing this goal argue that the few thousand pigs grown for their organs would represent just a small fraction of that total, and that they would be used to save human lives. The animals would be anesthetized and killed humanely.

Major religious groups have already weighed in, generally concluding that pig organs are acceptable for lifesaving transplants, noted Dr. Jay Fishman, co-director of the transplant program at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pig heart valves already are routinely transplanted into patients.

(Some leaders in the Jewish and Muslim communities, though, do not endorse pig kidneys for transplant.)

Scientists began pursuing the idea of pig organs for transplant in the 1990s. But in 1998, Fishman and his colleagues discovered that hidden in pig DNA were genes for viruses that resembled those causing leukemia in monkeys.

When researchers grew pig cells next to human embryonic kidney cells in the laboratory, these viruses — known as retroviruses — spread to the human cells. Once infected, the human cells were able to infect other human cells.

Fears that pig organs would infect humans with bizarre retroviruses brought the research to a halt. But it was never clear how great this threat really was, and as years have gone by, many experts, including Fishman, have become less concerned.

Some patients with diabetes have received pig pancreas cells, hidden in a sort of sheath so the immune system will not reject them. And burn patients sometimes get grafts made of pig skin. The pig skin is eventually rejected by the body, but it was never meant to be permanent anyway.

There is no evidence that any of these patients were infected with porcine retroviruses. In any event, said Dr. A. Joseph Tector, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, pig retroviruses are very sensitive to the drugs used to treat HIV.

""We don't know that if we transplant pig organs with the viruses that they will transmit infections, and we don't know that the infections are dangerous,"" Fishman said. ""I think the risk to society is very low.""

Church and his colleagues thought the retrovirus question could be resolved with Crispr, the new gene-editing technology. They took cells from pigs and snipped the viral DNA from their genomes. Then the scientists cloned the edited cells.

Each pig cell was brought back to its earliest developmental stage and then slipped into an egg, giving it the genetic material to allow the egg to develop into an embryo. The embryos were implanted in sows and grew into piglets that were genetically identical to the pig that supplied the initial cell.

Cloning often fails; most of the embryos and fetuses died before birth, and some piglets died soon after they were born. But Church and his colleagues ended up with 15 living piglets, the oldest now 4 months old. None have the retroviruses.

Church founded a company, eGenesis, in hopes of selling the genetically altered pig organs. Eventually, Church says, the company wants to engineer pigs with organs so compatible with humans that patients will not need to take antirejection drugs.",11/08/2017

Tampa Bay Times,8 keys to understanding Venezuela's controversial election,"About two months ago, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro did something drastic: He announced that Venezuela needed a new constitution. He would create a ""constituent assembly"" to draft the document, elections for which will be held Sunday.

It was a dramatic move, one that only deepens the country's crisis. Opposition activists had already taken to the streets to protest Venezuela's eroding democracy and decaying economy, and after Maduro's announcement, they redoubled their efforts. Even some of Maduro's closest allies told him he'd gone too far.

But he has refused to back down.

So on Sunday, without benefit of a referendum indicating that a majority of the country wants its 1999 constitution rewritten, Venezuelans will go to polls to select members for the new assembly. The group of 545 is likely to be packed with Maduro loyalists, experts say.

It's a scary moment for the country's democracy, once considered a South American success story. It's also complicated. Here are some key things to keep in mind:

What, exactly, is Maduro proposing?

Maduro wants to call to order an assembly that will rewrite the constitution. Technically, he has the power to do this — it's what President Hugo Chávez did when he rewrote the constitution in 1999. There's a key difference though: Chávez kicked off the process with a national referendum on whether the constitution needed a reboot. Once he won that vote, he held a second election for the assembly. Maduro wants to do something similar, but he has skipped the first step. On Sunday, Venezuelans will have only one choice: who should represent them in the assembly.

Another key difference: Chávez's constituent assembly was dissolved after it finished its work. It's not clear that that will happen this time around.

How will the new assembly work?

There will be 545 delegates to the assembly. About two thirds (364) will be chosen according to geography. Each of the country's municipalities will get to select one delegate; state capitals get two; Caracas gets seven. Since Venezuela is a predominantly urban country, and since the more populated states have fewer municipalities, this will give rural voters (who support Maduro) significantly more say in the assembly's make-up. To take one example: The state of Miranda, population 3 million, will get four fewer delegates than Falcon, home to about a third as many people.

In addition, 181 candidates will be selected by various constituencies and social groups. For example, students will choose 24 members via sectoral elections. Workers get 79 representatives, pensioners 28, business people five. Indigenous communities will fill eight slots. It's not clear why certain constituencies will get this power and not others. Opposition leaders say they suspect Maduro selected sectors with strong ties to him and Chávez.

About 6,000 people are running for seats; none come from the country's opposition, which is boycotting the election. There are a couple of high-profile candidates, including Maduro's wife and son; most of the others are government stalwarts.

What will the constitution say?

When Maduro announced the vote, he claimed that the new constitution would bring peace to Venezuela. In a speech, he said he aimed to ""let the sovereign people impose peace, harmony, and true national dialogue."" ""Votes or bullets, what do the people want?"" Maduro asked a crowd at the announcement.

Few specifics have been discussed. It's not clear what will be changed or rewritten. The fear, though, is that allies of Maduro will use the opportunity to target opposition leaders, silence dissent and install an ever-more-autocratic regime with fewer (or no) checks and balances.

First Lady Cilia Flores hinted that the assembly will create peace and justice commissions to ensure those responsible for the current political upheaval ""pay and learn their lesson."" This suggests that Maduro might crack down severely on those who oppose him.

Diosdado Cabello, first vice president of Venezuela's socialist party, says the assembly will strip legislators in the opposition-controlled National Assembly (the country's current legislative body) of their immunity from prosecution. If that happens, it could provide Maduro with another tool to go after lawmakers who oppose him. Cabello also said that it will ""turn upside down"" the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, which is currently run by an outspoken Maduro critic.

Why are people saying that this poses an existential threat to Venezuelan democracy?

The National Electoral Commission (led by Maduro loyalists) has given the constituent assembly ""total power to change any existing constitution and create a new legal order. The 'constituent assembly' also has the power to dissolve the National Assembly and change current legislation."" That means that it will preside over all the other branches of government. It could also get rid of the National Assembly. If that happens, Maduro and his allies will control all branches of government.

Maduro has taken other steps to consolidate power. Last year, he quashed a legal initiative for an election to recall him. He packed the Supreme Court with loyalists; then it tried to dissolve the National Assembly. Since March, more than 100 protesters have died at the hands of pro-government forces and more than 3,000 people have been arrested.

The constituent assembly, though, represents a major escalation. As the New York Times put it: ""the new assembly will rule above all other governmental powers — technically even the president — with the kind of unchecked authority not seen since the juntas that haunted Latin American countries in decades past. 'This is an existential threat to Venezuelan democracy,' said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group.""

How has the opposition responded?

Ever since Maduro's Supreme Court tried to strip the National Assembly of its power, the opposition has been hosting near daily mass protests and general strikes.

And while the main opposition parties are boycotting Sunday's vote, which they call unconstitutional, they held their own, non-binding referendum a couple of weeks ago. That referendum asked voters whether they wanted a new constitution. Nearly half of all eligible voters, or 7.2 million people, came out to cast their ballots against Maduro's National Assembly plan. They showed up even though there were threats of violence. Indeed, one voter lost her life. Overwhelmingly, these voters oppose the constitutional rewrite.

What do ordinary Venezuelans think?

The constituent assembly remains highly unpopular in Venezuela. One poll found that just 23 percent of the country support the idea; only 19 percent say a new constitution would ""guarantee the peace of stability of the country."" Half of those polled say the real purpose is to keep Maduro in power.

Even so, millions of people will likely show up to vote Sunday. In part, that's because the government has access to data showing who does and doesn't come to the polls. State and government workers worry that if they don't come, they'll be penalized. And with triple-digit inflation and horrifying food shortages, no one can afford to lose their job. As one person told CNBC: ""They're obliging us to vote ... If not, they'll fire us."" HIV patients say officials have threatened to cut off their access to their medicine if they don't vote.

Luis Vicente Leon, president of the Venezuelan polling firm Datanalsis, said he believes people will vote because they have to. ""If this was a free election, without pressure, about a third of the number that participated in the popular consult would vote,"" he told the Associated Press, referring to the opposition referendum.

If this is so unpopular, why is Maduro doing it? After all, he's already the president.

When Maduro was elected president in 2013, he had a tough task in front of him. He inherited a country with unsustainable government spending and an economy completely reliant on the price of oil. As oil prices dropped, Venezuela suffered.

Four years later, life in Venezuela is nearly impossible. The country has one of the highest inflation rates in the world. Though it sits on massive oil reserves, people cannot buy basic things like food and medicine. (Roughly 80 percent of medicines are unavailable, and people are so hungry that 75 percent of the country lost about 20 pounds last year.) Violent crime is rampant.

Today, Maduro's approval rating is in the low 20s. Opposition protests are massive. There's discord in the ruling party, and people are beginning to get impatient with the leader. I'm no Maduro whisperer, but the constituent assembly seems like a gamble to enable him to hold onto power by a leader who knows he can't hang on using the avenues currently available to him.

What will happen next?

It's impossible to predict, but there are a couple of things we can expect.

International groups have spoken out strongly against Maduro. And the United States, a key trading partner, has warned that if Maduro goes forward with this vote, it will impose heavy sanctions. We don't know exactly what those will look like. But if they're severe enough, they could deal a death blow to the country's economy, since the United States buys nearly half of Venezuela's oil.

The opposition will likely continue to rally support on the streets. The opposition-controlled National Assembly may try to consolidate its power by appointing its own judges. That's got experts worried about the possibility of parallel governments.

And the constituent assembly itself is a wild card. It will have so much power that it could do anything. It could even remove Maduro from office. ""It's a crapshoot, a Pandora's box,"" Alejandro Velasco, a Venezuelan historian at New York University who studies the country's leftist movements told the New York Times. ""You do this, and you have so little control over how it plays out.""

One thing is for sure: The fight between Maduro and his enemies won't end anytime soon. Protests and widespread political activism will probably continue at least until the next presidential election. That's slated for next year. But with a new constitution in the works, who knows when it will be held, if ever?",29/07/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Florida’s first walk-in clinics for medical marijuana are opening in Tampa Bay,"TAMPA  Inside a nondescript white-washed office building across from St. Josephs Hospital in Tampa is one of the states first walk-in clinics for patients seeking medical marijuana.

Similar to a walk-in urgent care center, Tetra Health Care is a place where patients can see a licensed doctor about obtaining medical marijuana as a form of treatment.

Tracilea Young, president and founder of the California-based chain of clinics, saw an opportunity to expand in Florida after the most recent round of legislation passed in Tallahassee earlier this year. Shes opened six Tetra Health Care clinics in Florida so far. Five of those are in the Tampa Bay area, including St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Tampa and Brandon locations. She plans to open 20 more across the state by next year.

""With such a high population of aging communities, medical marijuana is needed here,"" Young said. ""You wouldnt believe the patients we see who come in here with Excel spreadsheets detailing all the medications theyre on and when they take which pill. I just want to cry for them.""

Medical marijuana is a new but burgeoning industry in Florida, with laws that change nearly every year. Lawmakers have limited the selling and growing of marijuana to seven companies, but that number will expand to 17 this year, based on last-minute legislation that came out of a special session in Tallahassee earlier in this summer.

""Florida is the No. 1 state in terms of attracting marijuana companies right now,"" said Pete Sessa, chief operating officer and co-founder of the Florida Cannabis Coalition. ""Its the newest medical marijuana state. A lot of these companies want to expand and Florida is a natural next step for a lot of them.""

Related Coverage: Meet Floridas legal drug cartels

Young sees a business opportunity in being the intermediary between the Florida Department of Health and the companies licensed to grow and sell cannabis in the state. Tetra physicians will write the necessary ""recommendations"" (doctors arent allowed to call it prescriptions) for patients to fill at statewide dispensaries. Tetra charges $198 for the service.

Potential patients shouldnt expect to walk into a Tetra Health Care center and walk out with a doggie bag of weed. It doesnt work that way. Patients need to bring a valid Florida I.D., and proof of residency in the state for either a walk-in or appointment. Staff walks potential patients through the criteria required by department of health to help them register as a patient. Once an applicant pays the $75 state fee and receives their registration I.D. card in the mail, they can go to a dispensary with the recommendation they receive from a Tetra physician to fill an order.

While Tetra isnt affiliated with any statewide dispensing company and patients can fill their orders at any dispensary, Young has been impressed with some more than others.

""Knox Medical and CHT are all doing a great job with customer care,"" she said.

Young, 51, opened the first Tetra Health Care clinic in her home state of California in 2015 after she watched the father of her eight children suffer through stage four throat cancer.

""It was an awful experience. He was so sick,"" said Young, who has managed plastic surgery centers in the past. ""So we opted for medical marijuana and were just so surprised with what the experience was like.""

Young said the first time she and her husband went to get a recommendation from a doctor, they waited in a warehouse for hours. The doctor wrote the recommendation and quickly moved on to the other people waiting in line. Young decided she wanted to provide a more professional and customer-centric experience for patients.

""We got into the business 19 years late in California,"" she said. ""But weve learned a lot. Our patient base is strictly medical. Weve got to be one of the only centers in California that turns away recreational users.""

Young has traveled to Tallahassee three times since last November to advocate for laws that help patients.

""I dont see the laws going backward at this point, but its tough to predict what could happen in the future,"" she said about the current legislation in Florida. ""A lot of people voted for Amendment Two in Florida. Finally legislators are listening to whats happening.""

Youngs clinics in the Tampa Bay area see about 13 patients a day, on average. Inside, the clinics look like any other doctors office. Patients are greeted by reception staff adorned in medical scrubs. They receive a routine wellness exam and each exam room looks similar to any other doctors office.

""The level of care is what is most important to me,"" Young said. ""There are a lot bad actors out there, which makes it challenging for those of us who are doing things right.""

Tampa Bay Times,FDA panel recommends approval for gene-altering leukemia treatment,"A Food and Drug Administration panel opened a new era in medicine Wednesday, unanimously recommending that the agency approve the first treatment that genetically alters a patient's own cells to fight leukemia, transforming them into what scientists call ""a living drug"" that powerfully bolsters the immune system to shut down the disease.

If the FDA accepts the recommendation, which is likely, the treatment will be the first gene therapy to reach the market. Others are expected: Researchers and drug companies have been engaged in intense competition for decades to reach this milestone. Novartis is now poised to be the first, and it is working on similar types of treatments for another type of leukemia, as well as multiple myeloma and an aggressive brain tumor.

To use the technique, a separate treatment must be created for each patient — their cells removed at an approved medical center, frozen, shipped to a Novartis plant for thawing and processing, frozen again and shipped back to the treatment center. A single dose of the resulting product has brought long remissions, and possibly cures, to scores of patients in studies who faced death because every other treatment had failed. The panel recommended approving the treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has resisted treatment, or relapsed, in children and young adults ages 3 to 25.

One of those patients, Emily Whitehead, now 12 and the first child given the altered cells, was at the meeting of the panel with her parents to advocate approval of the drug that saved her life. In 2012, as a 6-year-old, she was treated in a study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Severe side effects — raging fever, crashing blood pressure, lung congestion — nearly killed her. But she emerged cancer-free, and has remained so.

""We believe that when this treatment is approved it will save thousands of children's lives around the world,"" Emily's father, Tom Whitehead, told the panel. ""I hope that someday all of you on the advisory committee can tell your families for generations that you were part of the process that ended the use of toxic treatments like chemotherapy and radiation as standard treatment, and turned blood cancers into a treatable disease that even after relapse most people survive.""

At the meeting, the panel of experts did not question the lifesaving potential of the treatment in hopeless cases. But they raised concerns about potentially life-threatening side-effects — short-term worries about acute reactions like those Emily experienced, and longer-term worries about whether the infused cells could, years later, cause secondary cancers or other problems. So far, no such long-term problems have been detected, but not enough time has passed to rule them out.

Another parent at the meeting, Don McMahon, described his son Connor's grueling 12 years with severe and relapsing leukemia, which started when he was 3. McMahon displayed painful photographs of Connor, bald and intubated during treatment. And he added that chemotherapy had left his son infertile. A year ago, the family was preparing for a bone-marrow transplant when they learned about T-cell treatment. Connor underwent the cell treatment at Duke University, and he has since returned to playing hockey. Compared with standard treatment, which required dozens of spinal taps and painful bone-marrow tests, the T-cell treatment was far easier to tolerate, McMahon said, and he urged the panel to vote for approval.

The treatment was developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and licensed to Novartis.

Use will not be widespread at first, because the disease is not common. It affects only 5,000 people a year, about 60 percent of them children and young adults. Most children are cured with standard treatments, but in 15 percent of the cases — like Emily's and Connor's — the disease does not respond, or it relapses.

Analysts predict that these individualized treatments could cost more than $300,000, but a spokesman for Novartis declined to specify a price.

Because the treatment is complex and patients need expert care to manage the side effects, Novartis will initially limit its use to 30 or 35 medical centers where staff will be trained and approved to administer it, the company said.

As to whether the treatment, known as CTL019, will be available in other countries, a Novartis spokeswoman said by email: ""Should CTL019 receive approval in the U.S., it will be the decision of the centers whether to receive international patients. We are working on bringing CTL019 to other countries around the world."" She added that the company would file for approvals in the European Union later this year.

The treatment requires removing millions of a patient's T-cells — a type of white blood cell — and genetically engineering them to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to carry new genetic material into the T-cells to reprogram them. The process turbocharges the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia. The T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells.

The altered T-cells — called chimeric antigen receptor cells — are then dripped back into the patient's veins, where they multiply and start fighting the cancer.

Dr. Carl H. June, a leader of the University of Pennsylvania team that developed the treatment, calls the turbocharged cells ""serial killers."" A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells.

In studies, re-engineering cells for treatment sometimes took four months, and some patients were so sick that they died before their cells came back. At the meeting, Novartis said the turnaround time was now down to 22 days. The company also described bar-coding and other procedures used to keep from mixing up samples once the treatment is conducted on a bigger scale.",13/07/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Times investigation: Henry Lyons diverted money from Tampa church that offered him redemption,"TAMPA — The church was in distress and likely heading to ruin.

Loan defaults and foreclosure proceedings had the members of New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in fear of losing their historic building on the edge of downtown Tampa. Elderly worshippers on fixed incomes were implored to donate more and more to save the church from potential calamity.

Yet unbeknownst to New Salem leaders during this time, a fund designed for churchgoers in financial crisis was being used to quietly direct tens of thousands of dollars to Pastor Henry J. Lyons, as well as to non-profit organizations he created, according to interviews and documents obtained by the Tampa Bay Times.

On the surface this is a story of disputed money, but it's also a tale of broken trust. Lyons, 75, was the leader of the nation's largest black church group in the 1990s, a mover and shaker whose pursuit of a lavish lifestyle led to fraud and racketeering convictions that landed him in prison for nearly five years. And New Salem is the small, oft-struggling church that offered an infamous preacher a chance at redemption.

While he never had direct access to New Salem accounts during his dozen-plus years there, a months-long Times investigation reveals a pattern of Lyons orchestrating transactions that shifted money away from the church and into accounts under his control.

Among the findings:

• The New Salem benevolence fund, which is intended to support church members in need, provided more than $76,000 directly to Henry Lyons, his wife, Willie, or to non-profits run by Lyons from 2013-17. That's nearly 83 percent of the money spent by the fund during that time.

• Federal money routed to New Salem for HIV awareness programs was subsequently sent to a non-profit run by Lyons, while thousands of dollars were paid directly to Willie and Henry Lyons in administrative fees.

• Lyons, who owes millions in restitution payments tied to his income level, accepted a reduced salary at New Salem and instead had the church mail thousands of dollars a year to First Baptist Institutional in Lakeland, ostensibly to fund programs for troubled black youth. Except the Lakeland pastor said nearly all of the money disbursed from that account eventually found its way back to Henry or Willie Lyons as ""reimbursements'' for expenses.

• While living a lifestyle filled with luxury cars, a prized coin collection and a large home in New Tampa, Lyons has doled out a paltry sum to his previous victims. From 2004 to 2015, Lyons paid the equivalent of a grocery bill — an average of $300 a month — to be split among the five companies he defrauded, while making thousands in consulting fees and donations from speaking engagements.

All of which could draw the attention of the U.S. Attorney's Office, which is in charge of collecting roughly $5 million in restitution from Lyons' 1999 convictions in state and federal courts.

ANDRES LEIVA | Times The Rev. Henry Lyons, former pastor of New Salem Missionary Baptist Church, stands with his wife, Willie, in their Tampa home. Lyons was fired on June 15 and Mrs. Lyons was removed as head of the church's day care program.

During an interview with the Times on June 16, and later through an attorney, the Lyonses say they have done nothing wrong. They say the allegations were manufactured by a handful of unhappy church members.

""Rev. and Mrs. Lyons deny any improprieties regarding the payments to First Baptist Institutional and payments out of New Salem's benevolence fund, and deny any claim or inference that such payments were made without the knowledge and approval of the trustees and deacons of New Salem,'' said Tampa lawyer Vit Gulbis, who was hired by Lyons three weeks ago.

Citing financial improprieties, New Salem fired Lyons as pastor on June 15 and removed Willie Lyons, 60, as head of the church's day care program. The Times has previously reported that the FBI has begun interviewing church officials and requesting financial documents.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: The struggle for the soul of Henry Lyons.

To be sure, this is not the Rolls Royce-driving, mansion-buying, sex-titillating story of Lyons' previous life when he was president of the powerful National Baptist Convention and pastor of St. Petersburg's Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church. These allegations don't compare to the million-dollar crimes that led to Lyons' convictions in both state and federal courts.

But in one respect, this could be worse.

The financial victims in Lyons' convictions were mostly corporations and the IRS. This time he is being accused of profiting at the expense of the very churchgoers who offered him a second chance after he was released from prison in 2003.

""This is one slick cat, man. I don't know how you take advantage of people like that,'' said Rufus Spencer, former president of the church and a onetime Lyons supporter.

""It's like, 'Dude, do you sit up at night thinking of ways to do (stuff)?' I just don't see why you want to come and do people like that, especially people that had taken you in.''

• • •

To understand why the church placed so much faith in Lyons, hiring him just months after he left prison, a little background is necessary.

At the time Lyons was released, New Salem was a mess. Infighting had led to the previous pastor's departure as well as a dramatic drop in church membership.

If hiring a new pastor with a checkered past was a risk, church members felt it was worth it to acquire someone with Lyons' star quality.

The phrase church members used at the time: A broken pastor for a broken church.

Hired for a modest $400 a week, he was promised that his salary would escalate if he could increase the church's membership. And that's exactly what he did.

Within a few years, New Salem went from an average of 50 people in the pews to more than 700 worshippers on the church rolls. New Salem leaders were emboldened enough to buy property near Interstate 4 and Sligh Avenue in 2007, with plans to build a more spacious and modern facility.

What they didn't count on was the nation's economic downturn.

When money got tight, the church started losing assets it had used to secure loans. By 2011, the bank had foreclosed on the 43 acres the church had purchased on Sligh. The parsonage, a house used by the pastor and visiting preachers, was also seized. And now a bank had begun foreclosure proceedings against the church's main building near the University of Tampa.

For more than three years, the church battled to stave off foreclosure. Week after week, members were told their tithes were not enough. More money was needed to save New Salem.

What church members did not know is that starting in 2013, while still facing foreclosure, an inexplicable amount of money was flowing through the benevolence account.

Alongside checks of $25, $75 and $100 written to members to help pay electric bills or car loans, there were much larger payouts, such as a $6,000 check written to Breach Ministries, a charity Lyons created. Another $3,700 written to National Trusted Partners, a national Baptist organization Lyons started. Another $3,700 written to Lyons himself.

In all, more than $42,000 in checks were written just to Breach out of this account between 2013 and 2015, according to a church ledger the Times obtained. Lyons and his wife received more than $18,000 from 2014 to 2017. National Trusted Partners got nearly $11,000. Church leaders say it is unclear how that much money got into an account that normally had a $3,000 balance.

A check register, above, shows payments to Breach Ministries, National Trusted Partners and Dr. Henry Lyons Below are examples of checks paid to Lyons and Breach Ministries, a nonprofit charity created by Lyons. A former church secretary says Lyons directed her to pay a fee to himself and Breach Ministries when the church received government and private grant funds.

The checks were written by an elderly deacon who told church officials he was following the pastor's orders.

""None of that was approved by the board,'' said New Salem chief financial officer Cheryl Carpenter, who is married to associate pastor Robert Carpenter. ""Even though Rev. Lyons may have had control over that account, (the board) should have been informed about money going to … his charity.

""That's the problem. That's the issue,'' she said. ''No one knew about this money coming out of benevolence and going to Breach Ministries.''

Carpenter said she asked for full disclosure of all church accounts when she took over as chief financial officer in 2015. She never saw the benevolence account until after Lyons was terminated.

""Based on their reactions, I'd say (church officials) were appalled at what was going on,'' Carpenter said. ""It was very disheartening to see this activity had been taking place based on the church's (finances) at that time.''

Henry and Willie Lyons have told the Times that trustees and deacons were fully aware of all financial transactions that were taking place between the church, New Salem Ministries and the Lyons charities.

So what, exactly, is Breach Ministries?

It's an idea Lyons came up with while still in prison. While reading the Bible, he came across a passage in Isaiah 58 that he said inspired him to help others facing hardship in their lives:

Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins;

You will raise up the age-old foundations;

And you will be called the repairer of the breach

""I discovered that while I was incarcerated,'' Lyons told the Times in an interview the day after his termination. ""This isn't verbatim, but it (said) there's a tear here in a wall, a breach. So people like me sought to mend that breach, so that hole will not be there in his life or her life.''

Willie Lyons said her husband wanted to ensure that the young men he came across in prison had someone to turn to when trying to start their lives over.

""That's what was in his heart when he started this,'' she said.

Yet for all the money that flowed from the church to Breach, the charity seems to have little presence anywhere. No website. No Facebook page. Some New Salem leaders had never even heard of it.

• • •

From a distance, the gesture looks selfless. Perhaps even noble.

Almost from the time Lyons began at New Salem, church officials say he wanted a hefty chunk of money sent to another church in lieu of a larger salary for himself.

Alex Harper is pastor of First Baptist Institutional Church in Lakeland.

So every month, a check was sent to First Baptist Institutional Church in Lakeland. This was the church Lyons visited hours after his release from prison. The church where he and Willie married on Easter in 2004. The church of Pastor Alex Harper, who had ministered to Lyons during his prison term.

The money, according to Harper, was for Lyons' Breach Ministries. He said Lyons wanted the money to be used as a lifeline for young, black men in trouble.

There is scant evidence of that happening.

Harper, who is on the board of directors for Breach, says he has never been notified of any board meetings taking place. He didn't recognize the names of several other board members, and he has no direct knowledge of any programs that were started or supported. He also could not name a single person in need who benefitted from the fund.

When shown a program from New Salem's 100th anniversary that included a congratulatory ad from Breach ministries with a photo identifying Harper as the charity's president, he said he had no knowledge of the ad and had never served as president.

""I really didn't have anything to do with the actual function of the ministry of the Breach program,'' Harper said. ""(Willie) was in charge.''

The way the fund worked, Harper said, was Willie or Henry Lyons would send him a requisition detailing their expenses for charity work, and he would reimburse them with a check.

In other words, all of the money flowed back to the Lyons family.

Based on New Salem bookkeeping accounts inspected by the Times, a total of $29,500 was sent to First Baptist Institutional from 2004-08. Another $43,712 was sent from 2010-14.

That's more than $73,000 that was not included in Lyons' salary, and thus would not have been used by the U.S. Attorney's Office to calculate restitution payments.

Meanwhile, New Salem's books show the money going to First Baptist Institutional and not to Breach Ministries. There's a reason for that. Harper said the account is his discretionary fund as pastor and does not have Breach's name attached to it.

Which leads to other questions:

If the money was meant for Breach, why wasn't it deposited directly into the Breach account controlled by Lyons? And why was it necessary for Willie and Henry Lyons to spend money out of their own pockets for Breach expenses and then get reimbursed from an unofficial Breach account?

Harper says the oddities of the arrangement should have raised a red flag for him. He also acknowledged he was allowed to dip into the fund to pay himself for incidental expenses.

""You can be naïve about things and do things without a whole lot of thought just because you know somebody,'' Harper said. ""I know I did not do this in a real efficient, business way. I should have been asking, ""What about this,' and ""What about that?' ''

When asked to explain the arrangement, Lyons' attorney said it was the first he had heard of it.

""Is there a legitimate reason to do it? I don't know,'' Gulbis said. ""I'll agree with you, it's an unusual arrangement.''

Later, after talking to Lyons, Gulbis said the pastor insisted there was nothing improper about the payments.

The money from New Salem stopped arriving at Harper's church in late 2014. Harper said he does not recall any conversations about why the arrangement ended, but said all of the funds are long gone.

Speaking on June 16, Willie Lyons told the Times it was not unusual for her husband to turn down paychecks.

""This is how he is when he has money coming to him,'' Willie said. ""He'll say, 'No, just give it to Breach. I'll put it there so it can help somebody else.' ''

• • •

The idea was to address poverty and despair in West Tampa. To be a source of hope in a downtrodden neighborhood. At least, that was the goal when the church established New Salem Ministries in 2003.

Some say the results turned out differently.

When New Salem Ministries began receiving grant money around 2010, former church secretary Wynie Anderson said Lyons would give her specific instructions on how to dole out the funds: She would write a check to one of his charities, another check to Lyons himself, and finally a smaller check to herself.

""I can't stand the sight of that man because I know what he's about. He's about money,'' Anderson said. ""If he can't figure out a way to make money, he don't want nothing to do with it.''

It's not unusual for an organization to take an allowable portion of grant money to cover administrative costs. Willie Lyons said any money distributed to her and her husband out of New Salem Ministries — as ""consultants'' — was well within the percentages allowed.

For instance, she said New Salem received an HIV grant for three years. If the money had been misappropriated, she said, the grant would not have been renewed.

""We did health fairs, we did workshops, we did testing events,'' she said. ""They were monitoring (us) and looking for specific information. So if there were funds issued that were not appropriate … they would have reprimanded us, or they would not have let us reapply.''

Church officials, however, say these funds were distributed out of the New Salem Ministries account without the board's knowledge or approval. Invoices indicate at least $16,390 was sent from New Salem Ministries to Breach Ministries to perform HIV-related tasks and programs.

The church asked Lyons and his wife to produce records that showed how much grant money was received and how it was dispersed, according to Ray Melendez, chairman of New Salem's board of trustees.

""They said, ""We have the records, give us time to get them together,' '' Melendez said. ""So we gave them a certain amount of time to come up with the records. We revisited that, and they still didn't have it ready. So they asked to extend it, and we said, ""No, the time has come.' ''

The church said few were aware the grant money had even been awarded, let alone was being redirected to Breach.

""Are there any contracts between us and Breach Ministries that we would donate to this charity?,'' Carpenter said. ""The answer to that would be no.''

While Lyons was not directly associated with any church bank accounts, he instructed at least two officials to write checks to him or his charities, according to interviews. Often, the people writing the checks were told to give themselves a stipend for their work.

""You know the kind of people who say the pastor can do no wrong? Those are the people he started looking for,'' said Spencer, the church deacon. ""He started moving us out and putting in people that he could kind of control. But anything he did, he made sure no alarms were raised.''

Secrecy, compartmentalization and vague bookkeeping made it hard for anyone to have a thorough understanding of the church's finances, according to multiple church officials and documents. It eventually led an outside CPA to part ways in 2011, and prompted her to write a letter suggesting the church was headed toward trouble.

Tracie Lowe said too many reimbursement checks were non-specific and missing verifying documentation. Without proper receipts those reimbursements should be considered salary, she wrote.

""Estimation of the reimbursement is a failure of accounting policy to match exactly the receipt detail to the expense,'' Lowe wrote in a letter obtained by the Times. ""This policy would mostly affect income for Dr. Henry Lyons.''

It would take six more years after Lowe resigned as the church's CPA , but the intervention of another outside group of auditors would prove to be Lyons' downfall at New Salem.

Church leaders wanted a management firm out of Atlanta to take a hard look at the church's books. Lyons was hesitant to cooperate even after the firm was hired. And when church trustees wanted the firm to inspect the day care center's books, Henry and Willie Lyons refused.

That's when church elders began diving deeper into the finances themselves.

New Salem, by this point, had been saved from potential foreclosure.

The downtown building was destroyed by an early morning fire in February, 2015, and the insurance settlement and subsequent sale of the land allowed New Salem to pay off its debts and buy a new building in Temple Terrace.

The fire's cause was never determined.

Associated Press (1999) The Rev. Henry Lyons, right, walks into the Pinellas County Courthouse in March 1999 with his then-wife Deborah, center, and church members for sentencing after being convicted last month of racketeering and grand theft. He spent nearly five years in prison.

He spoke of a life that was no longer his own. He answered not to the name his father gave him, but to a number the state assigned him. He was told when to wake, what to wear and when to sleep. Except, in those days, sleep rarely came.

Henry J. Lyons had already spent months in prison on state charges in 1999 when he appeared before a district judge in Tampa to ask for mercy on his federal sentence.

""I don't have a lot of time to right all the wrongs that I've done,'' Lyons told Judge Henry Lee Adams. ""If I was in my twenties, time would be on my side. But as I look at it now, time is not on my side because in my way of calculating things, I need to do at least 100 good deeds for every one of these bad deeds. I need time to do that. I need time to correct these wrongs.''

From a pure financial standpoint, it is unlikely Lyons will ever make good on that pledge. It is a simple algorithm of debt, age and salary. The first is too high, the second is too advanced and the third is too low.

But that doesn't mean his restitution is inconsequential.

He owes the corporations he once swindled. He owes the IRS for taxes he did not pay. He even owes the court for the cost of bringing him to trial. All told, the principal balance on his restitution as of June 30 was $4,979,970.91. If you include the interest, it's well north of $5 million.

There was a time when Lyons had plenty of cash at his fingertips. As the leader of the National Baptist Convention, he was courted by corporations and politicians seeking his favor. He owned multiple homes and spent freely on luxuries.

But his lavish lifestyle went up in flames exactly 20 years ago this week. After discovering he had purchased a Tierra Verde home with a woman later identified as his mistress, Lyons' former wife tried to set the house on fire.

The subsequent publicity shined a light on his lifestyle and, within a year, Lyons was facing charges of swindling a bank, a national funeral home company and others who had business dealings with the NBC. He was convicted in state court in Pinellas County and later agreed to a plea deal in federal court in Tampa that included restitution payments.

Since late in 2015, Lyons has been making monthly payments of $929.45 and another $178.35 is garnished from his Social Security checks. That translates to $13,293.60 a year.

The U.S. Attorney's office will not speak about individual cases, but officials say they typically do not seek more than 25 percent of a person's income.

The amount Lyons is currently paying would translate to an annual income of $52,956 if he were, indeed, paying 25 percent. Based on New Salem Baptist books viewed by the Times, Lyons made roughly $38,000 in salary in 2014. If you add another $14,300 in Social Security, that would bring his income to around $52,300.

So that would seem close to the acceptable range. Unless Lyons has additional sources of income.

A few years after being released from prison, Lyons ran for president of the Florida General Baptist Convention. He lost, and a month later created his own state convention called the General Baptist State Convention of Florida. A couple of years later he again ran for president of the NBC. He lost, and instead formed National Trusted Partners for Christ.

His own conventions have only a fraction of the membership of the old organizations that he once ran. There's likely no more than a couple of dozen churches in his state convention.

But churches in both the state and national conventions are expected to pay fees. They often bring cash offerings to the altar when Lyons is presiding over a convention service or seminar, according to New Salem members who have attended events.

Through his attorney, Lyons said he received no salary or compensation from the conventions or Breach Ministries.

The financial litigation unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa monitors restitution cases such as the one involving Lyons. How closely it follows depends on a case's priority, which is based on how much is owed and the likelihood of recovery .

The U.S. Attorney's Office would not categorize Lyons' priority, saying only they ""have a strong, ongoing interest.'' And would the office consider it a problem if someone was not disclosing income sources?

""We do take that seriously,'' said Anita Cream, head of the office's asset recovery division. ""That is a criminal violation itself, making a false statement to the government.''

The day he walked away from prison in 2003, Lyons looked to be in financial ruin.

Just two years earlier, he claimed in court documents to have no assets and $7.8 million in debts when filing for divorce from then-wife Deborah.

Aside from his disgraced tenure as a preacher and one-time leader of the National Baptist Convention, the most recent entry on his resume in 2003 was an $8-an-hour job as a clerk/janitor in a Lakeland funeral home where he spent five months in a work-release program.

His fortunes began to turn when he married Willie, who owned her own home in Lakeland, and when he was hired to rejuvenate New Salem Baptist Church.

The Henry J. Lyons of 2017 now lives in a 3,000-square foot home in a golf-and-country-club community in New Tampa. He and Willie both drive BMWs. He has an amateur coin collection in his home office, and his big screen TV is supplemented with a floor-to-ceiling sound system.

The $137,304.73 he owes in court costs in Pinellas County has not included a single payment in more than a decade.

ANDRES LEIVA | Times Lyons holds a bowl of what he called his rarest coins, pennies and other assorted change that he has found while walking.

In a room decorated with money, the bowl of coins is relatively worthless. Unless, perhaps, you consider the insight these stray pennies and dimes provide into the psyche of the Rev. Henry J. Lyons.

Here, in his home office, Lyons can relax among the framed, enlarged copies of paper currency. There are prized coins, faux gold bars and other collectibles.

Yet in a shrine to legal tender, Lyons seems most proud of a bowl of loose change he has picked up from sidewalks, parking lots and who-knows-where. He read once that, at any given time, there is $3 million lying on the ground, just waiting to be found.

The search for money, presumably, continues.

Tampa Bay Times,Pro-pot forces calm waters as USS Maryjane sails through Temple Terrace parade,"TEMPLE TERRACE — Dropping a giant joint in favor of the ""USS Maryjane"" seemed to smooth the waters for a pro-marijuana entry in this year's Temple Terrace Fourth of July Parade.

The new float designed by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws featured the flag-festooned ship crewed by some military veterans and painted with the slogan, ""Hemp for Victory.""

The theme plays off a World War II film from the Department of Agriculture that praised the nation's hemp farmers for their work in creating strong ropes from the stalks of marijuana plants for the armed forces.

""Apparently, they were so normal that people didn't know who they were,'' said City Council member Cheri Donohue, who said she received no angry e-mails this year.

That's a far cry from last year's NORML entry, which raised residents' ire with a mock-up of a giant marijuana cigarette billowing smoke.

""It was a great day, a great float,'' said Christopher Cano, executive director of NORML's Central Florida chapter.

Cano said he saw a number of people at the parade Tuesday showing their support and counted only three negative reactions, including one woman who turned her thumbs down.

Another change from last year: Florida lawmakers acted during their spring session to implement a constitutional amendment legalizing medical use of marijuana, which was supported by 71 percent of voters. Patients with conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and epilepsy can buy and use medical marijuana.

Cano said city staff members reviewed the plans for the new float and approved it, with one telling him, ""As long as there is no giant marijuana cigarette, you should be okay.''

Also aboard the float were several members of Weed for Warriors — veterans who promote medical marijuana to treat disabilities. The ship, named the USS Maryjane, was adorned with American flags and ""Don't Tread On Weed,"" a variation of the Revolutionary War slogan.

Tampa Bay Times,Some services shift to new provider at Hernando Health Department,"BROOKSVILLE — Some faces have changed, but the services at the Florida Department of Health in Hernando County haven't, as the agency has begun a significant transition.

In May, some of the best-known programs offered through the department were switched over to a new provider. Earlier in the spring, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that Premier Community HealthCare, based in Dade City, would receive $1.2 million to expand its services into Hernando County for about 8,400 patients.

Premier has been providing medical care to Medicaid and Medicare recipients and the uninsured and underserved communities in Pasco County since 1979. Now it has taken on previous Hernando-based Health Department services, including primary care, dental, behavioral health and prenatal services.

The funding comes in the form of a service area competition grant. According to a news release about the change, officials hoped for a seamless transition.

""When we applied for the SAC grant, we knew there was a great need for increased access to health care services in Hernando County,"" said Joey Res­nick, chief executive officer for Premier. ""This funding gives us the opportunity to extend our 38-year history of Premier delivering compassionate and quality health care services to Hernando County residents while helping reduce barriers to care that many in the area face every day.""

The federal funding, which will designate the Premier operation as a federally qualified health center, will also provide medication discounts to patients.

Resnick said last week that the change has been every bit as smooth as had been hoped. Premier is providing primary care services one day a week in Spring Hill and in Brooksville, and dental care once a week in Spring Hill. Those services will expand to five days a week in both locations later in July, with four-day-a-week dental service in Spring Hill and one-day-a-week service in Brooksville.

""As we make this transition, I'd like to reassure the public that our Health Department will remain open and will continue to focus on core public health,"" Health Department administrator Robin Napier said as the transition began.

Core public health services that still will be provided through the original Health Department include family planning, birth control, women's health services, the Women, Infants and Children program and breast-feeding promotion and support. Also remaining under the Health Department are screenings and treatment for tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and AIDS, as well as birth and death certificates and environmental health services.

""We are very pleased to work closely with Premier Community HealthCare as they expand into Hernando County,"" Napier said.

While the transition has meant that 28 staff positions with the Health Department were lost, all of those employees except for two who retired have found work with Premier or elsewhere, according to Kathy Sauskojus, senior public health services manager with the Health Department.

She agreed with Resnick that the change has been seamless. That has been helped, both say, by having a Premier representative available in the offices to answer questions and set up appointments as patients come in.

""It's all about the patients,"" Resnick said.

Services by each of the entities will continue to be provided in the same Health Department locations — at 300 S Main St. in Brooksville and at 7551 Forest Oaks Blvd. in Spring Hill — both owned by Hernando County.

""Our biggest concern is that we want the public to understand that the Health Department will still be open for business and will still provide the same quality services,"" Sauskojus said.

Tampa Bay Times,Gulfport potter McCabe Coolidge continues to give back,"GULFPORT

Next to a popup canopy under which colorfully glazed bowls, coffee cups, flowerpots and other pieces of clay pottery are scattered on tables, a gray-haired man sits hunched over a pottery wheel.

The tanned knees sticking out of his shorts provide elbow rests for hands that are covered in clay, dry and a lighter color around his wrists but dark, thick and wet on the fingers he uses to draw the lump of clay up and out as the wheel spins.

""Coffee cups are like jewelry,"" he says as the clay takes shape. Beauty and functionality are in the eye of the beholder.

""Some people want to have a handle for one finger; some want a handle big enough for two fingers. In fact, one guy wanted to put three fingers into the handle. I made it, but it looked like a pot with a handle.""

Bowls of benevolence

The potter who has set up shop on Beach Boulevard, in front of the Casino, at the Gulfport Tuesday Fresh Market is 74-year-old McCabe Coolidge, a longtime part-time Gulfport resident who recently took up permanent residence.

""These are like babies,"" he says as he makes a cup. ""You have to pay attention to these things.""

The deliberateness of his clay molding both reflects and belies the long and winding road down which life has taken him since he was born outside Battle Creek, Mich.

Its divergent path is not unlike the clay that continually changes shape in his fingers. But the constant in his life, like the spinning wheel on which he works, has always been humanitarianism, most recently helping out Pinellas County Habitat for Humanity.

He makes functional, high-fired stoneware bowls, food-, dishwasher-, oven- and microwave-safe, to give as housewarming gifts to every member of every family that moves into a Habitat home in Pinellas. He started in March and has already made and given about 65 bowls to Habitat families.

""All bowls are glazed differently and I also include small bowls for children in the family,"" he said.

""I am part of the food chain with my pottery — in a good way.

""The best part is when I have kids watch me who stare and ask questions. I don't want the whole world to lose track of how to do things. These are one of the few things that are still done with hands.""

Losing a child

Before using his hands to make beautiful pieces of clay, he used his hands to tap and pat the chest of his daughter, Robin, who was born with cystic fibrosis, a progressive, genetic disease that causes a thick buildup of mucus in the lungs that makes it hard to breathe. Gentle patting on the chest and back for 10 minutes four times a day — ""percussion therapy"" — helped clear Robin's airways to make it easier for her to breathe in her short life.

She died in 1976 at age 6. Coolidge was devastated.

""It's horrendous to lose a child at age 6,"" he said. ""There was no place to go for solace.""

Forty years later, he still sees his life in two stages: life before Robin died and life after.

It was a good friend of the family who recognized Coolidge's need to do something with his hands after they were no longer needed to ease his daughter's pain.

She suggested pottery. She was taking a class herself. He agreed to go. He wasn't very good at first, he said, but he learned to be patient, that mistakes are natural.

That pottery class was the beginning of Coolidge readjusting his place in the world, his role in life.

""I no longer needed security. My role was no longer my career,"" he said.

What he needed were solitude and peace.

He found that peace by helping others, a vocation he had turned to during other troubling periods in his life.

A life of learning

During the Vietnam War, McCabe was in the Peace Corps. He was sent to Bolivia, where he lived in a Roman Catholic monastery with nuns and brothers.

""We prayed every day; that sustained me. It was chaotic outside; I needed inner peace.""

Upon his return, he decided he wanted to continue in the church but as an Episcopal minster not a Catholic priest. He studied at the Virginia Theological Seminary while remaining active in the peace movement.

By this time, he and his wife, Cathy, had two daughters, both severely handicapped. Robin was born in 1970 with cystic fibrosis. Molly was born a year later with cerebral palsy and mental retardation. They moved to North Carolina, where Coolidge attended Duke Divinity School and moonlighted as a marketing manager with a life insurance company.

After getting his theology degree in 1973, he got a job at an Episcopal church in Chapel Hill, N.C. It was three years later, when Coolidge was working at a church in Cary, N.C., that Robin died — and his world collapsed.

He was like a rudderless ship looking for solid ground.

He kept his ties to the church, working part time, as he and his wife restored and rebuilt an abandoned farmhouse in Chatham County, N.C.

From there, they began buying, fixing up and repurposing tobacco barns into homes.

To help other parents who had lost children, they created the Recompense Retreat Center. They created a community farm. He worked as a chaplain for families of handicapped children. The couple adopted a third child, Angie, in 1978.

And yet, inner peace continued to elude him.

New beginnings

He took a sabbatical from the church and built a wooden sailboat in Beaufort, N.C.

He took another sabbatical to attend the Harvard Summer School of Dance, where he studied improvisational dance.

He took his love of dancing home, finding a dance space for workshops. It was relatively smooth sailing for a while. Molly moved into a group home. Angie went to college.

And then, another storm surge. In 1993, the year his dad died, the Coolidges' marriage ended.

""The divorce rate for parents of handicapped children is 90 percent,"" he said.

""It was a call to the wild. I had to get away from everything.""

And so, he packed up and moved to Chicago, where he lived and worked with the homeless and those dying of AIDS.

But dance remained a bright spot in his life, and it was at a dance conference that he met his second wife, Karen. They moved back to North Carolina — ""I love that state"" — and, in 1995, bought an old Victorian house in Asheville for homeless people who were HIV positive. They formed a dance troupe and did improvisational dance workshops.

A few years later, they lived on a sailboat in Alameda, Calif., while Karen got her degree to be a Unitarian Universalist minister from the University of California, Berkeley. Coolidge worked at a day center for the homeless and took writing classes.

They returned to Greenville, N.C., in 2001 when Karen took a job with the Unitarian Universalist Church.

Finally, joy, then . . .

In 2006, they moved to Floyd, Va., which is near Roanoke. Karen continued her work with the church, but pottery took center stage in their lives. They opened a gallery-studio at a local arts center. They sold the pottery they both enjoyed making and taught classes in clay and creativity.

They continued their work to eradicate hunger. They raised money through the Empty Bowls Project, in which people paid $15 for a bowl of soup in a handmade ceramic bowl they got to keep. They donated the proceeds to the Backpack Project, in which they filled backpacks with food for kids to take home. They co-founded an organization called Plenty! to provide access to fresh, healthy food to poor families in Appalachia.

In the midst of helping others, Coolidge was struck by a tragedy of his own. He got Lyme disease from a tick bite.

If treated early enough, the symptoms of the disease — fatigue, pain and joint and muscle aches — often go away. However, in Coolidge's case, they didn't, likely because his 2006 bite went undiagnosed for a year. His joint pain continues. He said he sometimes loses his cognitive ability. That's because untreated or undertreated symptoms of the disease can make the bacteria associated with it go into hiding in different parts of the body only to reappear later, according to lymedisease.org, a nonprofit that advocates for education, research and treatment of tick-borne diseases.

Coolidge said he has had six more infections since being diagnosed. The flareups, his doctor told him in 2015, were not helped by the cold temperatures in the mountains of Virginia. He needed to live somewhere warm.

And, that's how McCabe Coolidge's winding life path brought him here permanently, continuing a lifetime of altruism, making bowls for new owners of Habitat for Humanity homes.

Tampa Bay Times,Legalized medical marijuana signed into law by Rick Scott,"TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Rick Scott on Friday signed into law a broader medical marijuana system for the state, following through on a promise he made earlier this month.

Lawmakers passed the measure, SB 8A, in a special session after failing in their regular session that ended in May to implement a constitutional amendment legalizing the drug, which was supported by 71 percent of voters last year.

Under the constitutional amendment, patients with a host of conditions can buy and use medical marijuana. Among the conditions that qualify for the drug: cancer, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and epilepsy.

The new law also sets in motion a plan to license 10 new companies as growers by October, bringing the statewide total to 17.

It allows patients to use cannabis pills, oils, edibles and ""vape"" pens with a doctor's approval, but bans smoking.

""The constitutional amendment was passed overwhelmingly, and I'm glad the House and Senate were able to come together for a bill that makes sense for our state,"" Scott said earlier this month.

Lawsuits are likely to follow. John Morgan, the Orlando trial lawyer who bankrolled the constitutional amendment's campaign, has promised to sue over the smoking ban, and Tampa strip club owner Joe Redner said he will file a suit because people cannot grow their own plants.

""Great Scott,'' Morgan said Friday after hearing that Scott signed the bill. ""It's a no-brainer. Gov. Scott wants to run for U.S. Senate. If he didn't sign this bill, he couldn't run for dog catcher.

""It's not perfect. I'm going to sue for the smoking but I know there are sick people who will see relief starting in July,'' he said.

The marijuana law was among 38 bills Scott signed Friday afternoon.

He also approved a measure HB 441 that will give court clerks added protection in public record cases.

Current law does not specify whether clerks can be sued for handing out information that is supposed to be protected from public disclosure if the lawyers who filed documents with that information did not mark it as confidential. Now, they will have that protection.

And a bill HB 689 to let anyone with a beer and wine license sell sake beginning July 1 was signed into law as well. That, Times food critic Laura Reiley writes, would be good news for fans of sushi and ramen who want to enjoy the Japanese rice spirit with dinner.",23/06/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Celebrate Pride with this playlist of LGBTQ musicians,"I first came out over a decade ago, early in the torments of middle school and deep in the cornfields of suburban Indiana. To say I was lacking classmates who were out and local queer role models — let alone national ones — feels like an understatement. The school and public libraries offered few LGBTQ books, most of them academic, clinical and inaccessible to a preteen. The music collection was even slimmer, and I yearned for more.

Back in those days — you know, LimeWire, Yahoo Music and MySpace — it wasn't easy to find many openly queer musicians, given the homophobia and sexism rampant in the music industry. Living in small-town Indiana without access to a local LGBTQ music scene didn't help.

And so, it felt like divine intervention when a few years later in 2007, a Canadian indie duo released The Con just before I turned 16. Tegan and Sara kick off the album with I Was Married, a short and unassuming but defiant tune against homophobia, and I was immediately hooked.

At the time, the United States had just one state (Massachusetts) with marriage equality on the books. Legislative protections in Indiana and nationwide seemed unlikely in my lifetime. The Defense of Marriage Act, Don't Ask Don't Tell and awful jokes about HIV/AIDS were all the rage. Classmates ripped down posters for Day of Silence and spit homophobic slurs behind my back. My hometown's hate radiated from every glance.

It felt hopeless.

But finally, I could see myself — the joy and the anxiety of being queer — reflected in music, a lifeline of mine. Tegan and Sara gave me a reason to hold on because these two talented, hilarious and tiny lesbians showed there was a future for a queer kid like me. Now at The Con's 10th anniversary, it remains my favorite album of all time.

It shouldn't have taken all those years to find hope. Luckily, it has become easier and more common for musicians to be out and express all kinds of LGBTQ stories. There's still a long way to go, but it's been beautiful to see more and more artists safely come out and be supported, giving a voice to many.

Take the work of Perfume Genius, the project of Mike Hadreas and his boyfriend, Alan Wyffels. One of Hadreas' goals, Wyffels told NPR, is to be the kind of ""artist that he wished he could have had as a young gay man.""

Whenever I listen to music from LGBTQ artists, those notes give me the strength to be proud even at my weakest — even when I feel like that lonely queer kid in Indiana again.

The importance of that visibility brings me to this weekend's all-important Pride party playlist.

While there are many gay anthems created by allies — FYI Carly Rae Jepsen's E•MO•TION technically turns 2 on St. Pete Pride's parade day — I encourage Pride playlists to include as few straight, cisgender artists as possible. This month is about recognizing and celebrating our achievements despite a homophobic and transphobic society, and queer musicians across genres deserve support.

So, consider these LGBTQ artists while celebrating Pride this weekend and beyond. It's not an exhaustive list, especially because I went for hype vibes. And you'll notice it's missing many big names to help shine a light on musicians who deserve more exposure — like Mykki Blanco, MUNA, Alex Lahey and Perfume Genius.

What songs did I miss? Which queer musicians do you really dig? Tweet me at @ashleycdye.

Tampa Bay Times,"Tampa's Joe Redner wants to grow his own cannabis plants, says suit","Count Joe Redner, Tampa's outspoken strip club entrepreneur and a lung cancer patient, among the first to challenge the state's medical marijuana laws in court.

Less than two weeks after lawmakers put in place new laws governing growing, manufacturing and selling medical marijuana, Redner's lawsuit claims the state is not following the will of the public, which voted overwhelmingly last year to legalize it by passing a constitutional amendment.

Specifically, Redner wants to grow his own marijuana plants. But under Florida Department of Health rules, Floridians are barred from growing cannabis plants for their personal use, including those who are legally registered as medical marijuana patients. Redner's lawsuit is challenging those rules.

Those in Florida's expanding medical marijuana industry say Redner could be one of many to challenge the state's laws on pot.

Lawmakers have limited the selling and growing of marijuana to seven companies. The number will grow to 17 this year, based on last-minute legislation that came about during a special session in Tallahassee earlier this month.

Previous Coverage: Meet Florida's legal drug cartels

That legislation also allows patients to use cannabis pills, oils, edibles and ""vape"" pens with a doctor's approval but bans smoking.

Redner's lawsuit is based on how the state constitution amended by voters defines marijuana. He suits claims that the definition includes ""all parts of the plant.""

Under the current rules, he said the dispensaries are left to decide what parts of the plant to use in its products. He said he wants to grow his own plants because he says he has no idea what he's getting from the state's licensed growers and distributors.

""I don't know if they're using pesticides or doing what's good for the plant,"" he said. ""I'm a raw vegan. I am very careful about what I put into my body. And the amendment gives me the right to that.""

Department of Health officials declined comment, citing the litigation.

Redner, 77, the owner of the Mons Venus strip club, is a registered medical marijuana patient in Florida and uses cannabis products to treat conditions related to his stage-four lung cancer. He also battled brain cancer in the past.

SUE CARLTON: A Joe Redner you might not know

""I want to grow plants — plural. Twenty of them,"" he said in an interview. ""I'm doing research right now and I want to be able to use it in juicing. To be effective enough, I need to grow 20 plants.""

His lawsuit is seeking declaratory judgement on the merits of his claim and is not seeking any damages. He has been vocal about medical marijuana in the past, including speaking out against rules proposed by the Hillsborough County Commission to limit where dispensaries can operate.

More than 70 percent of voters in 2016 approved Amendment 2, expanding the legalization of medical marijuana in Florida from just the terminally ill and some other patients with epilepsy and cancer, to those with other debilitating conditions such as glaucoma, HIV/AIDS and post traumatic stress disorder, among others. Lawmakers struggled with how to implement the expansion, which is result in a $1 billion industry in Florida within the next three years.

The Department of Health currently oversees the state's seven current operators. Redner says he plans to apply for a dispensary license as well.

Those within the burgeoning industry say Redner's lawsuit will hardly be the last.

""I think the legislators for the most part did a good job given the oppositional context of passing legislation. But they also took liberties that were not afforded to them by the constitution,"" said Ben Pollara, executive director of Florida For Care, an organization founded in 2014 to advocate for the legalization of medical marijuana under Amendment 2. ""I think you'll see lawsuits surrounding the policy positions and around the application process for becoming a licensed medical marijuana dispensing organization.""

John Morgan, the high-profile Orlando trial attorney who bankrolled two Florida political campaigns to legalize it, also has threatened to sue over the ban on smokeable forms.

Pollara says that many other states have put provisions in place for patients who want to grow their own plants, and Florida is one of the few states that has not seriously considered it.

""It's not an extreme position,"" he said. ""It's probably the single largest complaint that I've received over the last four and a half years doing this campaign.""

Through the years, Floridians arrested for marijuana possession have argued in court with varying degrees of success that they were using the drug out of ""medical necessity"" to treat an illness. Jesse Teplicki won an acquittal in a Broward County court in 2015 after he was caught growing marijuana plants in his home that he said he used to treat his anorexia and nausea.

Redner's lawyer, Amanda Derby, says litigation like this just comes with the territory.

""New legislation calls for new litigation, unfortunately and fortunately,"" Derby said. ""I think the amendment is pretty clear on its face, but the way it's set up gives the Department of Health so much power. I think if more patients find that growing their own provides better treatment, you'll see more litigation in the future.""

Redner, a frequent but so far unsuccessful candidate for political office, is no stranger to the Florida court system. He once famously claimed he was gay in a 2005 federal lawsuit to challenge a ban on public recognition of gay pride events passed by Hillsborough commissioners.

""I've used the constitution as grounds to battle arrests in the past and I've gotten those arrests thrown out. It's pretty clear to me that the constitution gives me the right to challenge this. The state is not reading the amendment, they're not going by what it says,"" Redner said on Monday. ""This is a health issue as far as I'm concerned.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Review: U2 light up Raymond James Stadium in Tampa with vivid, cinematic concert","The big, brilliant rainbow hung high above the Tampa skyline for as long as it could, a good half hour and change, a harbinger of Irish gold if ever there was one.

Then the sun set and U2 took the stage at Raymond James Stadium. And for the rest of the night, every last color belonged to them.

Unbowed by an afternoon of showers that had some 60,000 poncho-wrapped fans fearing the worst, the Irish rock superstars delivered a vivid, cinematic and magnificently colorful performance as part of a 30th anniversary tour celebrating their landmark album The Joshua Tree. For multiple generations of fans, from U2 lifers to the kids and grandkids on their laps, it was all they were looking for and more.

""Thank you for your patience,"" Bono said. ""Thank you for giving us a good life. These songs belong to you. We’ve been playing them a long time, and we’re playing them for you tonight.""

""Playing"" was an understatement. The band practically painted the songs of The Joshua Tree before our eyes, splashing their romantic vision of the American west across a canvas befitting a masterpiece, a 200-foot-wide high-def video board that stretched nearly the width of the stadium floor. Every song lit up in brilliant new hues, from bloody reds and mesmerizing prisms to bright, bold footage of the American men and women of Bono’s dreams: Weathered, hardscrabble, bound to their earth, awaiting a fate unknown.

At first, though, it was nothing like that. At first — moments after the pre-show rainbow dissipated into the inky sky — U2 emerged to a stark, smaller B-stage one by one, with Larry Mullen Jr. popping out the tribal warbeat of Sunday Bloody Sunday, then the Edge swinging his guitar back and forth, then Bono stomping and punching the air and Adam Clayton thrumming out a rhythm. Then came New Year’s Day, then Bad, then Pride (In the Name Of Love): Four mega-hits to get the crowd chanting, even before The Joshua Tree kicked in.

The video backdrop then bloomed to blood-red life for Where the Streets Have No Name, the album’s timeless and perfect Side 1, Track 1. And from that point on, the set was as visual as aural, with colors bursting from the screen like a fresh 96-pack of crayons — crimson moons, indigo skies, blaze-orange mountainscapes, electric Joshua trees that glowed in every hue. On Mothers of the Disappeared, orange candles held by a row of mourning women flickered against a background of deep aquamarine. Even black and white footage, some of filmed by Anton Corbijn to evoke of The Joshua Tree’s original artwork, exploded to life as if in 3-D.

For lifelong fans, the thrill of this tour was hearing some of The Joshua Tree’s lesser-played songs live, and the band was up to the task. Clayton and Mullen remain a rock-steady rhythm section, with Clayton’s bass guiding the way through indelible hits like Red Hill Mining Town and Bullet the Blue Sky. Bono’s voice had its moments — a wobbly, jazz-inflected delivery to open With or Without You, for instance — but in some ways he’s an even better singer today than in 1987, a little more limited in range but more in control of the notes he does hit.

And ever the perfectionist, the Edge and his guitars were a sight and sound to behold, from the watery pings of Bad to the screaming feedback of Bullet the Blue Sky to the bucking-bronco blues of Trip Through Your Wires. Even when he switched to an organ, his sound filled the stadium — Bono called for the Edge to take the audience to church on I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For, but Running to Stand Still is the song where it actually felt like he got them there.

Apart from the nostalgic appeal of the music, though, why tour The Joshua Tree in 2017?

To hear Bono tell it, some of its songs feel as relevant as ever in a deeply fractured America — think of Red Hill Mining Town, he said, and the modern debate over coal’s place on this planet; or In God’s Country, and ""how the landscape can change in a person, in a town, in a country, even a magnificent country like this one."" One Tree Hill, he dedicated to the city of Orlando, ""for the Pulse nightclub and for the 49 souls that were taken away last year. There is no end to grief, and that’s how we know there is no end to love. We will honor them with action.""

What that action entails, well, that was open to interpretation. Bono did not praise Sen. Marco Rubio, as he did a few nights prior in Miami, nor did he explicitly criticize President Donald Trump. Instead he spoke obliquely of a ""mass movement that changes things and changes history. It’s worth remembering that in a time of great"" — here he paused before spitting the next word — ""personalities, sometimes it’s actually just what the people are doing. It’s the power of the people that’s always stronger than the people in power, right?""

The encore felt like a greatest hits of Bono’s life in activism. War-torn peoples? Check: A dramatic reworking of Miss Sarajevo was dedicated to the Syrian refugee crisis. Feminism? Check: The rousing Ultra Violet (Light My Way) featured chartreuse- and fuchsia-tinted portraits of women throughout history, from Rosa Parks to Lena Dunham. AIDS and HIV? Check: One, of course, that all-time lighers-up anthem of togetherness.

Even as Bono stumped and speechified and preached to his choir, none of it diminished the artistry of U2’s music and stadium-spanning visuals. Never did the light fantastic trip like it did on the final three dialed-up songs — the prismatic rainbow of Beautiful Day, the futuristic cobalts of Elevation, the dizzying blacks and reds of howling closer Vertigo.

During Beautiful Day, Bono spliced in a few bars of Singin’ in the Rain, a nod to the afternoon downpour, but by that point, the rain was long forgotten. After the flood, all the colors came out. The night was as brilliant as the day.

Tampa Bay Times,Audit finds understaffing and lax control of medication at state mental hospitals,"Florida's state-run mental hospitals are understaffed, some are unlicensed and they are failing to keep track of pharmaceuticals and seized contraband, according to a new state audit.

At one North Florida hospital, more than 2,800 anti-psychotic drugs and 350 HIV antiviral drugs were misplaced, the report states. Bookkeeping at two other hospitals was so lax that auditors could not determine whether drugs were missing.

Hospital directors were not always told about suicide attempts or, in one case, that a patient had escaped, auditors found. And wards at the hospitals continue to be understaffed even after state lawmakers pledged to tackle that issue in the wake of the Tampa Bay Times and Sarasota Herald-Tribune investigative series ""Insane. Invisible. In danger,"" a Pulitzer prize-winning project that revealed escalating violence and neglect in Florida mental hospitals.

The report from the Auditor General's Office published this month looked at seven mental health facilities across the state either run directly by the Florida Department of Children and Families or its subcontractors.

The biggest shortcoming it found is the state not putting enough resources into hospitals and treatment centers, said Rajiv Tandon, president of the Florida chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

""The mental health system is grossly, grossly underfunded,"" he said. ""We are 51 out of 51 in terms of per capita funding for mental health. We're last.""

The seven hospitals treat people who were placed in custody under the Baker Act and criminal defendants found mentally unfit to stand trial. Many are ""civil commitments,"" patients not charged with a crime but considered dangerous to themselves or others.

In 2014, DCF conducted a comprehensive review of safety and performance and later adopted a four-year improvement plan that runs through 2020. That came after state lawmakers between 2009 and 2014 slashed about $100 million in funding for mental hospitals.

In a May 23 letter to Auditor General Sherrill Norman, DCF Secretary Mike Carroll said his agency has ""worked aggressively"" to improve safety and outcomes for patients.

Some $19 million in new funding was allocated for behavioral health services in the 2016-17 fiscal year, said DCF spokeswoman Jessica Sims. The agency's 2017-2018 budget includes more than $126 million for mental health treatment facilities and community behavioral health funding.

""Many of the findings in this report are issues DCF has already addressed or that were already in the improvement process at the time of the audit,"" Sims said.

Auditors reviewed hospital records and visited the facilities over a nine-month period through August 2016.

They found there was confusion over how large a staff should be on duty to better ensure the safety of staff and patients.

Employees at the Northeast Florida State Hospital told auditors ""they did not know how the staffing requirements had been developed, but the requirements had been the same for at least 12 years."" In cases where there were patients on wards who were under specialized therapeutic observations or who needed security escorts, hospitals failed to provide additional staff.

At Northeast Florida State Hospital, 173 of the 336 shifts were understaffed, auditors noted.

A consultant hired by DCF in 2015 found there were no national standards for staffing of mental facilities. The agency is in the process of updating guidelines so facilities know how to figure out minimum staffing levels, DCF told auditors.

Another concern for auditors: DCF had failed to obtain licensing for the North Florida Evaluation Treatment Center, the Treasure Coast Forensic Treatment Center and two residential and two Florida State Hospital residential buildings.

Under state law, mental hospitals must be licensed by the Agency for Health Care Administration, which conducts annual inspections to ensure hospitals follow state guidelines.

Hospital management initially told auditors the facilities were unlicensed because they would not meet fire and other building codes. Building a new facility to code at the North Florida hospital would cost $45 million and renovating the residential buildings at Florida State Hospital another $21 million.

DCF also told auditors that the two centers were not designed to be hospitals and that clinical services were administered only in licensed facilities.

Auditors dispute that, saying they saw diagnostic, treatment, and therapeutic services given to patients in unlicensed beds.

Each hospital includes a licensed pharmacy that dispenses drugs, including psychotropic medications. But the facilities did a poor job of keeping tabs on the medication, auditors found.

At Florida State Hospital, roughly 2,800 tablets of three different anti-psychotic drugs costing more than $37,000 were misplaced.

And neither the North Florida Evaluation and Treatment Center nor the Northeast Florida State Hospital required staff to conduct quarterly counts of drugs to reconcile with inventory records, as required by the federal government.

DCF officials said they are in the process of establishing stricter purchasing and management controls. That includes the purchase of automated medication carts, which cut down on how many trips nurses have to make to the pharmacy to pick up medication.

Tampa Bay Times,The drug crisis is now pushing up death rates for almost all groups of Americans,"The opioid epidemic that has ravaged life expectancy among economically stressed white Americans is taking a rising toll among blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, driving up the overall rate of premature death among Americans in the prime of their lives.

Since the beginning of this decade, death rates have risen among people between the ages of 25 and 44 in virtually every racial and ethnic group and almost all states, according to a Washington Post analysis. The death rate among African Americans is up 4 percent, Hispanics 7 percent, whites 12 percent and Native Americans 18 percent. The rate for Asian Americans also has increased, but at a level that is not statistically significant.

After a century of decreases, the overall death rate for Americans in these prime years rose 8 percent between 2010 and 2015.

The jump in death rates has been driven in large measure by drug overdoses and alcohol abuse, according to the Post's analysis of mortality data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""What it reflects is an out-of-control epidemic right now,"" said Josh Sharfstein, director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins. ""It's affecting the economy. It's affecting the entire community. This is an absolute call to action for public health.""

Ashish Jha, a health policy professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, added, ""These are people who are in the most productive years of their lives — the years where they're supposed to be raising kids and becoming leaders of the next generation.""

The Post confirmed the contours of the rise in death rates with CDC officials. The rate is adjusted for the nation's changing age profile, and every five-year age group (for example, 35 to 39, or 40 to 44) showed an increase in mortality.

Preliminary data from the first half of 2016 suggests that the trend is continuing, said Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics for the CDC.

""I think we're in for another steep increase in the drug overdose deaths overall,"" Anderson said.

The rash of deaths is a statistical echo of the 1980s and early 1990s, when the combination of the crack cocaine and HIV epidemics took a heavy toll on young Americans.

Many factors are likely contributing to the current spike, but opioids stand out. The widespread abuse of prescription drugs has become a national crisis, with addicts overdosing on prescription opioids; their illegal cousin, heroin; and, increasingly, synthetic drugs such as fentanyl and carfentanil, which are far more powerful and deadly.

Alcohol-related deaths also have increased among whites, blacks and Hispanics, the data show. Meanwhile, homicide, the leading cause of death among young blacks, also has risen since the beginning of this decade.

The new mortality spike is seen in almost every state. The breadth of the nation's deteriorating health has not been widely appreciated. Academic researchers and the news media in recent years have focused on the most intensely affected regions, such as Appalachia and rural New England, and on premature deaths among white Americans, a trend that began around 1999 and continues unabated.

For more than a century, Americans lived much longer lives because of improvements in medicine, sanitation, control of contagious diseases, nutrition and individual health care. But American mortality appears to have reached an inflection point around 2010, in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession. Generally positive mortality trends among blacks and Hispanics flattened out, then gradually worsened.

For blacks and Hispanics, the biggest increase in deaths came in 2015, data for which was released earlier this year.

The geography of the epidemic also expanded dramatically. From 1999 to 2010, only seven states showed an increase of more than 10 percent in the death rates of people ages 25 to 44: West Virginia, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. All have predominantly white populations and few if any big cities.

The data from 2010 to 2015 tell a different story. During that period, 33 states showed death rates rising by at least 10 percent in the 25-44 age bracket, including all of New England and the Midwest Rust Belt. The death rate in Illinois is up 31 percent. Only in Hawaii and the District of Columbia has the death rate continued to decline since 2010.

Moreover, a phenomenon most pronounced among whites in small cities and rural areas appears to be spreading to the nation's suburbs and biggest cities. Before 2010, death rates had been declining for whites, blacks and Hispanics in metropolitan areas of at least 1 million people. Since 2010, the rates are up everywhere.

""The data is very concerning,"" said Leandris Liburd, director of the CDC's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity. ""We do not want to see death rates going up for any age, or any ethnic or racial group. The rise in mortality is likely due to multiple factors, and opioids are certainly a part of the problem.""

One clear distinction remains: education level. The only 25-to-44 group whose death rate is not climbing is people with four-year college degrees.

""People with four-year degrees overall are doing fine in this economy, and everybody else overall is doing pretty poorly,"" said Joan C. Williams, a University of California law professor, author and scholar on work and class. ""This whole large segment of society is seeing their grip on the American Dream slipping away.""

Deaths from drug overdoses among whites are still more than double the rate for blacks, and are rising rapidly. But the data suggest that this is a contagion that will not recognize boundaries of race or ethnicity.

In Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, coroner Thomas Gilson testified in the Senate last month that he has seen deaths double in one year among African Americans from fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid, often taken in combination with cocaine.

""With seemingly purposeful intent, cocaine is now being mixed with fentanyl and its analogues in an effort to introduce these drugs into the African American population,"" Gilson testified.

""Fentanyl is playing a major driving force in increasing overdose deaths,"" said Michael Botticelli, director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center and the former head, under President Obama, of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. ""Fentanyl is much more powerful than heroin or morphine. Often drug users don't know it's in their supply. It's increasingly fast acting. We know that the window of our opportunity to respond and resuscitate people is dramatically shortened.""

Botticelli said dealers make a risk calculation when selling fentanyl or fentanyl-laced drugs: Addicts want the strongest drugs available, even if they are potentially fatal. He said a dealer arrested in Massachusetts had sent a text message to a colleague: ""We don't want to kill them, we just want to bring them to that point.""

The country is beginning to recognize the scale of the crisis, said Sharfstein, and turning to the question of how to fix it. But, he said, a criminal, judgmental or moral approach will block effective solutions.

""A really important barrier is to set aside ideology and say, 'This is killing our children. What can we do to make a real difference?',"" he said. ""In many parts of the country, there is not access to treatment that is effective for people, and in fact there is opposition to treatment that is effective for people. They say people should be put in jail.""

A report in March, the 2017 County Health Rankings, produced by the University of Wisconsin and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, also highlighted a rise between 2014 and 2015 in premature deaths among people ages 15 to 44 and the broad geographic and demographic spread of those deaths.

In modern times, increases in mortality have been rare. One of the most dramatic occurred during and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when the economy went into free-fall and anti-alcohol campaigns were abandoned. Life expectancy for men dropped precipitously.

National attention to rising death rates in the United States flared following a November 2015 study by Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who noted that whites in their midlife years (45 to 54) have been dying at surprisingly high rates since the end of the 20th century. Case and Deaton earlier this year said the ""deaths of despair"" from drug overdoses, alcohol abuse and suicide appear to be associated with the deteriorating labor market since the 1970s among people without a college degree.

Deaton, a Nobel laureate, said the bigger picture for America is ""catastrophic."" Death rates are supposed to go down, not up, he said. ""A society where this is going the wrong way, there's something very, very seriously wrong with it.""",11/06/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Gov. Rick Scott says he will sign medical marijuana bill approved by lawmakers,"TALLAHASSEE — More patients will soon be able to buy medical marijuana in Florida after state lawmakers passed legislation Friday putting into effect a constitutional amendment passed by 71 percent of voters.

Under that constitutional amendment, patients with a number of conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS and epilepsy are supposed to have access to the drug.

The legislation sets in motion a plan to license 10 new growers by October, bringing the statewide total to 17. It allows patients to use cannabis pills, oils, edibles and ""vape"" pens with a doctor's approval but bans smoking.

""Now is the time to do this,"" Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said, noting that the bill will increase access for patients who need access to the drug.

Lawmakers approved the bill by a 29-6 vote in the Senate and 103-9 in the House.

Gov. Rick Scott said Friday he plans to sign the bill into law.

""The constitutional amendment was passed overwhelmingly, and I'm glad the House and Senate were able to come together for a bill that makes sense for our state,"" he said.

Lawmakers were forced to handle the issue in a special session after failing to reach agreement during their regular, 60-day session that ended in May.

Among the provisions:

• Patients can access the drug if they have chronic pain but only if that pain is connected to another qualifying medical condition.

• Ten new growers will get a license to open dispensaries, but as many as eight have been held for specific groups: Five for previous applicants to the existing, limited cannabis program, one for a member of the Florida Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association and two for citrus processing companies, which will get priority, not a guaranteed license.

• Cities and counties can ban dispensaries, but they are not allowed to block delivery of cannabis or limit where pot shops can open more strictly than they do pharmacies.

""If we fail to implement this amendment, then unfortunately, I think what happens is the courts will be the ones to decide how this amendment is implemented,"" said House Majority Leader Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero.

There is still a chance that will happen, though.

Many activists expect there will be lawsuits over the legislation. And it appears lawmakers expect to be in court, too. They added language separating the bill into pieces so a judge can invalidate part of it without upending the entire system.

At least one lawsuit is already planned. John Morgan, the Orlando trial lawyer who bankrolled the campaign for medical marijuana, has promised to sue over the smoking prohibition.

Patient advocates have generally been supportive of lawmakers moving forward with a bill that is expected to increase access to the drug, but they raise serious concerns about some components of the bill.

Opponents of the Legislature's language commonly say they want patients to be able to smoke and for those who have chronic pain unconnected to another medical condition to be able to use cannabis.

""No smoking is not what patients voted for,"" said Moriah Barnhart of Brandon, whose daughter, Dahlia, uses cannabis as treatment for brain cancer. ""Not allowing this medicine to be used in a public place is extremely discriminatory. . . . We don't choose when and where our kids cramp or seize.""

That's a viewpoint several lawmakers expressed, as well.

""I don't believe that this bill implements the will of the constitutional amendment that the people of Florida voted for,"" said Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth. ""I've heard a lot of friends and colleagues say that we've got to do something, but that's not how I feel about this bill. I think we've got to do the right thing, not just something.""

That's not the only voice of opposition, however. Other lawmakers voted against the legislation because they oppose medical marijuana to begin with

""I still think a few people need to tap the brakes and say, 'Should we be going down this road?' "" said Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala. ""No matter what's in the Constitution, I still have concerns.""

Tampa Bay Times,Lawmakers to vote (finally) this week on medical marijuana deal,"TALLAHASSEE — State lawmakers reached an agreement to make medical marijuana available in Florida, ending an impasse that derailed the issue last month.

Reached Tuesday night after weeks of closed-door negotiations, the deal affirms the will of 71 percent of voters who approved a constitutional amendment in November's election that allowed patients with a host of conditions access to the drug.

Lawmakers plan to vote on the issue by week's end. It could be one of the only bills to pass during a three-day special session that began Wednesday under a cloud of discord and fears that lawmakers may not accomplish their work on other issues.

""Our constitutional duty is to ensure the availability and safe use of medical marijuana in the manner prescribed by Florida voters,"" Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said in a statement. ""This patient-first legislation will expand access to this medicine, while ensuring safety.""

Some supporters of the amendment, while pleased that lawmakers reached consensus on legalization, criticized what wasn't included.

Take smoking. The bills (HB 5A, SB 8A) allow patients to buy and consume cannabis from licensed growers and consume it by ""vaping,"" as edibles or as oils. But both prohibit smoking the drug.

John Morgan, the Orlando trial lawyer and possible gubernatorial candidate who bankrolled the Amendment 2 campaign, said that if the bill is signed into law, he plans to sue the state.

""Done is better than perfect and this is far from perfect,"" he wrote in a post on the website Medium. ""I will be suing the state to allow smoke. It was part of my amendment.""

If the legislation passes, lawmakers want the Department of Health to grant 10 new licenses, first to qualified nurseries that tried to get a license previously but were beaten out for the license by another company. They will join the existing seven growers that were licensed under a much more limited cannabis program the Legislature passed in 2014.

The legislation would also expand who could use the drug.

The amendment called for a wide array of qualifying medical conditions: cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, post-traumatic stress disorder, ALS, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or other, similar conditions. Lawmakers expanded the list to include terminally ill patients, regardless of their illness, as well as chronic pain that was caused by one of the conditions in the amendment.

Neither the Legislature's proposal nor the constitutional amendment allows patients to access medical marijuana based on chronic pain alone.

""Our obligation right now is to look at what's in the amendment and to make sure that we have a law that accurately reflects it and gives access to those patients whose illnesses are enumerated,"" said Rep. Katie Edwards, D-Plantation.

Patients would be allowed to buy a 70-day supply of cannabis and would have to visit their doctor once every 30 weeks. Each grower would be limited to opening 25 dispensaries.

On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott cleared the way for lawmakers to vote on the legislation, which has broad support among the rank-and-file members of the House and Senate.

""It is the role of the Florida Legislature to determine how to best implement this approved constitutional amendment,"" Scott said in a statement.

This is the second time lawmakers tried to reach a deal legalizing medical marijuana. Negotiations broke down last month over how many storefront dispensaries each licensed grower could open.

This time, the House agreed to a limit of 25 and agreed to having a separate cap for each region of the state. Senators pushed for the caps, arguing they will help prevent the first people allowed into the market from becoming too powerful.

But there's a catch: Caps are set to increase by five for every 100,000 patients registered to use marijuana, and license holders can sell unused dispensary slots to one another. The entire cap provision expires in April 2020.

""It accomplishes (the Senate's) goal of restraining the growth initially to see how the market will develop,"" said House Majority Leader Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero.

Still, the option to sell dispensary slots could be good news for some of the companies that hold a license already. One such company, Surterra, could make $138 million by 2021 based on a plan to open 55 dispensaries, according to a document by potential investors obtained last month by the Times/Herald.

Pro-medical marijuana activists generally praised the Legislature for reaching agreement, even while pointing out that it still has flaws.

""The bill is not perfect, but whatever flaws there are can be addressed in a future session,"" said Ben Pollara, one of the men behind the constitutional amendment and executive director of the advocacy group Florida for Care. ""The critical need is for the House and Senate to send a bill to the governor so that patient access can expand in Florida.""

Tampa Bay Times,Mel and Betty Sembler's Drug Free America Foundation calls for special marijuana session,"An unlikely voice has joined the drug policy activists calling on Florida lawmakers to come back in special session focused on medical marijuana: The Drug Free America Foundation, which opposes medical marijuana and whose founders spent nearly $10 million trying to kill the 2014 and 2016 constitutional amendments to legalize medical cannabis.

In a letter sent late last week, Drug Free America’s executive director Calvina Fay urged Senate President Joe Negron to join the call for a special session.

""The legislature has an obligation to find a balance that protects the public health and safety of all Floridians while allowing for legal access of marijuana that was approved by voters,"" Fay wrote. ""It is imperative that our legislators take action and not allow the marijuana industry to operate as it does in some states with no regards to public health and safety.""

Drug Free America was founded in St. Petersburg in 1995 by wealthy conservative financiers Mel and Betty Sembler after a controversial drug treatment program they founded called Straight Inc. was shut down following accusations of abusing teen participants. The foundation does not engage in treatment but instead focuses on advocacy and shaping drug policy.

Among their advocacy: Drug Free America and its lobbying arm, Save Our Society from Drugs, gave state lawmakers a list of suggestions for policy this session as the Florida Legislature worked to implement Amendment 2, which was passed by 71 percent of voters. Many of them made it into early versions of a House bill and several looked likely to survive in final legislation that the Legislature failed to reach a compromise on in session’s eleventh hour.

The Semblers and others on the Drug Free America board of directors were among the strongest voices opposed to Amendment 2, which requires the state to write rules allowing patients with a list of conditions including HIV/AIDS, cancer, PTSD and multiple sclerosis to use medical marijuana by July 3.

Mel and Betty Sembler gave $1 million in 2016 and $100,000 in 2014 to the political committee opposing Amendment 2, called Drug Free Florida. They also brought in support from other anti-drug campaign donors including Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who gave $7 million over the course of both campaigns.

Drug Free America’s letter calling for a special session brings the group in a rare point of agreement with the two men who were behind the Amendment 2 campaign: Ben Pollara and John Morgan, who separately called for a special session weeks ago.

Unlike Pollara and Morgan, who want to see a more open market (though their definitions of what makes the market open and what limits government ought to set have led to a high-profile feud between them), Fay wrote in the letter to Negron that Drug Free America wants to see restrictions in whatever legislation might pass the House and Senate.

The existing, small medical marijuana industry, Fay wrote, is ""operating outside of what the proposed rules and regulations would allow.""

Demands for lawmakers to come back to Tallahassee are growing among elected officials as well. While Negron has not yet committed to a special session — and would be unlikely to unless differences between the House and Senate legislation can be settled first — House Speaker Richard Corcoran has openly endorsed bringing lawmakers back to complete the will of 71 percent of voters.

As well, more than two dozen lawmakers from both parties have publicly said they want a special session. Two gubernatorial candidates have joined the calls as well: Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, a Republican, and former Congresswoman Gwen Graham, a Democrat.

Tampa Bay Times,John Morgan and other medical pot supporters call for special session after Legislature's inaction,"TALLAHASSEE — Supporters of legalized medical marijuana are calling on Gov. Rick Scott to order a special session after state lawmakers failed to pass a bill to implement a ballot measure approved by 71 percent of voters in November.

On Saturday, John Morgan, the Orlando trial lawyer who bankrolled the Amendment 2 campaign, called for the Legislature to be brought back to Tallahassee in a special session focused on cannabis.

Morgan objected to the Florida Department of Health being the lone entity to write rules that would let patients with conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis access marijuana.

Absent lawmakers agreeing to rules, the amendment that Morgan pushed and helped to write allows for the Department of Health to make the rules. Still, he said, handing it off entirely to the department will likely result in fewer licensed growers — and less access for patients.

""It's a bureaucrat carrying out the will of the people instead of their representatives,"" Morgan said Saturday. ""It's perverted.""

Other marijuana activists and patient advocates also worried that the Department of Health won't write adequate rules without the proper guidance from lawmakers.

""DOH has a responsibility to implement this,"" said Ben Pollara, executive director of Florida for Care and one of the writers of Amendment 2. ""That's all the more reason that we actually need implementing legislation.""

Pollara joined Morgan and others, lobbyists and lawmakers, who say the Legislature needs to play a role — even if it's in the next legislative session, which begins in January.

Sen. Rob Bradley, who pushed a medical marijuana bill, said he isn't confident the Department of Health rules will be in line with bills the Legislature put forward, which had broad agreement on many issues, even though they couldn't reach a final deal Friday.

""That's a real concern and the Legislature at some point in time needs to have a bill that implements Amendment 2,"" he said Friday night. ""We've provided the basis and the groundwork to get this done eventually. It just isn't going to be during this session.""

Asked Saturday if Scott would call a special session and what he wanted to see in health department rules, a spokeswoman for the governor said simply, ""Our office is reviewing our options on this issue.""

Weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate behind closed doors broke down in the final days of the legislative session over proposed caps. The sticking point: the number of dispensaries each licensed marijuana grower could open. The issue was so divisive that the two men behind Amendment 2, Morgan and Pollara, squabbled on opposite sides.

Senators, aiming to prevent one or two growers from dominating the marketplace, pushed to limit the number of storefronts each could open. Pollara, who ran the United for Care campaign last year, openly advocated the idea and called on activists to demand the Senate language pass.

Meanwhile, the House, where Morgan was quietly working alongside Speaker Richard Corcoran, sought no caps, arguing that the free market would allow for high-quality cannabis at low prices.

On Saturday, Morgan took to Twitter and accused Pollara of selling out.

""(Ben) breached the trust of those who trusted and used my good name in his shenanigans,"" Morgan tweeted, forcing Pollara to tweet denials.

On most other points, the two chambers of the Legislature found agreement. Notably, they planned to remove restrictions that patients feared would make it too hard to get a doctor's recommendation for the drug, make medical marijuana tax-free and allow vaping and edibles.

It's not yet clear what the Department of Health will do with the rules now that it has control.

The department published draft, placeholder rules in January, but had signaled it was waiting on the Legislature to act.

Health officials now go back to the drawing board to write sweeping public policy that patients, advocates, business interests and doctors are sure to scrutinize.

""Regardless of what myself or Florida for Care does on it, it's going to be ripe for challenge from the patient side and the physician side and the businesses,"" Pollara said.

Tampa Bay Times,"As clock ticks down, lawmakers struggle to close pot deal","TALLAHASSEE — With one day left for the Florida Legislature to act, lawmakers say they are close to a deal on medical marijuana.

Thursday evening, the Senate passed sweeping legislation to implement a system that would allow patients with a wide array of conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS and post-traumatic stress disorder, to buy and use marijuana.

While the language in the Senate bill, which passed 31-7, is similar to what the House passed earlier this week, several key differences threaten to derail the process.

For one, the House wants marijuana to be tax-free, which the Senate doesn't. And the Senate restricts the number of dispensaries each marijuana company can open to prevent storefronts opening ""on every corner.""

""If this doesn't work out, this'll be the reason,"" said Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, referring to the limits on dispensaries.

The number of new growers that can be licensed is also a key difference between the bills. The House would hand a license to SunBulb in Southwest Florida. The Senate would give licenses to Treadwell Nursery in Central Florida and Loop's Nursery in Northeast Florida.

What is clear is this: Lawmakers don't want to allow smoking but are fine with ""vaping"" and edibles, and they have tried to make it easier for doctors to become certified in recommending cannabis and for patients to obtain a recommendation from a new doctor.

Lawmakers came to Tallahassee with a mandate to legalize the drug from more than 71 percent of voters who passed Amendment 2.

The stakes are high to pass a bill before adjourning for the weekend today: If lawmakers don't reach an agreement, and if the Florida Department of Health doesn't issue its own regulations by July, any Floridian could sue the state.

On Wednesday, Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, who bankrolled the constitutional amendment, threatened to sue the state over one of the points of agreement between the House and Senate: a ban on smoking medical pot.

""I will sue and I will win!"" Morgan tweeted, along with a link to a Times/Herald story about the latest House deal. The amendment, he contends, allowed for smoking.

""THIS is why politicians are despised,"" tweeted Morgan, who is mulling a run for governor in 2018.

Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, was an early supporter of medical marijuana and proposed legislation that would have more broadly opened up the marketplace, which was abandoned in favor of Bradley's legislation early in the legislative session. Brandes said that the provisions moving through the Legislature now won't do what the voters wanted and that the issue may as well be left open to the courts.

""My concern is you have a major piece of public policy that hasn't had public discussion,"" Brandes said. ""As an insider, it's frustrating to watch. I can only imagine how as somebody on the outside watching, it is incredibly frustrating.""

Tampa Bay Times,Florida House passes medical marijuana language,"The Florida House passed legislation that would put medical marijuana into effect in the state after making last-minute changes released by bill sponsors Tuesday morning.

Under the House’s proposal (HB 1397), patients with a list of conditions — including cancer, HIV/AIDS and epilepsy — could be certified to obtain medical marijuana by a doctor. The bill also says that patients with chronic pain can access the drug, but only if that pain is directly linked to a debilitating condition that would have qualified them regardless.

The bill passed 105-9 with votes against it coming from some of the House’s most liberal and most conservative members.

Restrictions and limitations in the bill — including a limited number of license holders and a ban on smoking — are inspired by concerns that the federal government might decide Florida’s medical cannabis program is too unregulated, House sponsor and Republican Leader Ray Rodrigues of Estero said.

""We have to make it legal and available to Florida residents, but we have to do it in such a way that it complies to the guidance we’ve been given by the federal government,"" he said.

The bill represents the largest number of new growers proposed to date by the House. It would automatically give the potentially very lucrative license to the seven growers currently licensed under a more limited cannabis program, plus 10 new growers right off the bat. After that, four new growers could enter the market for every 100,000 patients.

According to Rodrigues, ""95 percent"" of the language in the legislation represents a compromise with the Florida Senate, which is expected to take up its bill for the first time on Wednesday. Senate sponsor Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, could not be reached to confirm that early Tuesday afternoon.

Some House Democrats raised concerns that the bill was too restrictive. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, and other liberal Democrats said the bill should allow all patients with chronic pain and permit smoking, which it bans outright.

""Last time I checked, Florida was the Sunshine State not a nanny state,"" Smith said. ""Who are we to tell legitimate patients they cannot smoke their cannabis? That’s not our business.""

The group behind Amendment 2, which set this legislation in motion, said they do not support Rodrigues’ language.

""HB 1397 puts profits over patient access,"" Florida for Care executive director Ben Pollara said in a statement. ""It not only maintains but strengthens the cartel system of licensed marijuana growers in Florida. … Prices will be high, quality will be low and choices will be few.""

Conservative lawmakers, meanwhile said Rodrigues’ proposal puts into place something that, though approved by 71 percent of voters last November, ought not be part of state law.

""I don’t believe that medical marijuana exists. I just don’t,"" said Rep. Julio Gonzalez, R-Sarasota, one of three medical doctors in the Florida House. ""I’m stuck as a physician.""

He likened medical marijuana to the myth that surrounds Gasparilla.

But Rodrigues, who did not vote for Amendment 2, says the bill represents a compromise between open access for patients and the restrictions that come from cannabis being classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance by the federal government.",02/05/2017

Willie N. Rogers was never comfortable being the center of attention.

His penchant for silence, in fact, led to questions about the role Rogers actually played with the airmen. Then a letter arrived from the White House two weeks ago, written by President Barack Obama before he left office, thanking Rogers posthumously for his service.

Tampa Bay Times,"Jonathan Demme, 'Silence of the Lambs' director, has died at 73","Jonathan Demme, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who observed emphatically American characters with a discerning eye, a social conscience and a rock 'n' roll heart, achieving especially wide acclaim with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Philadelphia,"" died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.

His publicist, Leslee Dart, confirmed the death. Demme disclosed that he had cancer in 2015.

Mob wives, CB radio buffs and AIDS victims; Hannibal Lecter, Howard Hughes and Jimmy Carter: Demme (pronounced DEM-ee) plucked his subjects and stories largely from the stew of contemporary American subcultures and iconography. He created a body of work — including fiction films and documentaries, dramas and comedies, original scripts, adaptations and remakes — that resists easy characterization.

A personable man with the curiosity gene and the what-comes-next instinct of someone who likes to both hear and tell stories, Demme had a good one of his own, a Mr. Deeds kind of tale in which he wandered into good fortune and took advantage of it. A former movie publicist, he had an apprenticeship in low-budget B-movies with the producer Roger Corman before turning director.

Demme became known early in his career for quirky social satires that led critics to compare him to Preston Sturges. They included ""Handle With Care"" (1977), originally titled ""Citizens Band,"" about an eccentric network of rural Americans linked by trucks and CB radios, and ""Melvin and Howard"" (1980), a tale inspired by true events, which starred Jason Robards as the billionaire recluse Howard Hughes and Paul LeMat as an earnestly good-natured gas station owner who picks him up in the desert after Hughes has crashed his motorcycle. Hughes ostensibly leaves a colossal fortune to the man, who never gets the money, of course, losing his claim to it in court.

""Mr. Demme and Bo Goldman, his screenwriter, take Melvin's tale at face value and present the movie as Melvin's wildest dream,"" Vincent Canby wrote in a review in The New York Times. ""The comic catch is that this wild dream is essentially so prosaic. It's also touched with pathos since Melvin — in spite of himself — knows that it will never be realized. This is the story of his life.""

Later, as a known commodity, Demme directed prestige Hollywood projects like ""Beloved"" (1998), an adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel about the lingering, post-Civil War psychological horror of slavery, with Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover in starring roles, and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2004), a remake of the 1962 Cold War drama of the same title about a brainwashed American prisoner of war. Demme's updated version, starring Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, takes place during the Persian Gulf war.

Demme may be best remembered for that pair of films from the 1990s that were, at the time, his career's biggest anomalies. The first, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), was a vivid thriller based on the novel by Thomas Harris that earned five Oscars, including best picture and best director. Unlike his previous films, with their arch amusement and tender melancholy, this was straightforward and serious storytelling with only a few moments of shivery humor.

The story is told largely from the perspective of an FBI trainee who becomes a key figure in the pursuit of a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill when she is assigned to conduct a prison interview with Hannibal Lecter, a mad and murderous psychiatrist, hoping to extract from him clues to Bill's identity.

Lurid and titillating, the film is full of the perverse details of heinous crimes and marked by a seductively ambiguous bond that forms between the young agent-to-be, Clarice Starling, and the brilliant monster Lecter. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won Oscars for their memorably distinct character portrayals. The movie is also marked by Demme's characteristically restless camera and the prominent use of music. The score, with its eerie leitmotif, is by Howard Shore.

Demme's next narrative venture, ""Philadelphia"" (1993), brought to the fore the strain of advocacy in his work that was otherwise evident in his documentaries about Haiti, former President Jimmy Carter, New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and his cousin, Robert W. Castle, a white activist priest in Harlem.

""Philadelphia,"" from a script by Ron Nyswaner, starred Tom Hanks, as an ambitious lawyer who is fired from his prestigious firm when the partners learn he has HIV, and Denzel Washington, as the scrappy independent lawyer who represents him in a suit against the firm.

It was the first big-budget Hollywood film about AIDS, and with its forthright depiction of homosexuality, homophobia and the disease that was rampaging through the gay community, it became a turning point in the way mainstream American movies treated gay men and lesbians, whose sexual orientation had previously been treated with hush-hush delicacy or flamboyant caricature.

Hanks won an Oscar, and so did Bruce Springsteen, for the song that introduces the film, ""Streets of Philadelphia.""

Rock music — music in general, really, but rock and its Caribbean siblings most of all — is central to many of Demme's films. Among them was one of his last, ""Ricki and the Flash"" (2015), which starred Meryl Streep as the aging singer of a bar band in California who is the ex-wife of a well-to-do Indianapolis businessman (Kevin Kline) and the estranged mother of their children.

Rock 'n' roll plays a heroic role in the film, knitting the family back together as Streep, playing with Rick Springfield among others, covers several rock standards, including Springsteen's ""My Love Will Not Let You Down"" and Tom Petty's ""American Girl,"" a song that is featured in at least two of Demme's other movies as well.

""Music was my first love, movies came second,"" Demme once told the long-defunct New York newspaper The SoHo News. In a 1988 interview with Premiere magazine, he said: ""I grew up with rock 'n' roll — literally,"" adding, ""The first rock song I remember was 'Sh-Boom,' and since then I've never stopped obsessing on at least something.""

The synchronization with music and narrative is most evident in ""Something Wild"" (1986), a ""really screwball"" comedy, as Pauline Kael of The New Yorker Kael described it, that ""breaks conventions and turns into a scary slapstick thriller."" The beginning, set in New York City, features a telling establishing shot, perfect for the time and place — the Reagan '80s, with its ostentatious masters of the universe and a teeming, disdainful underclass — in which the head of a young man with a boom box on his shoulder is held briefly but firmly in the frame before the camera moves.

""I can't think of any other director who is so instinctively and democratically interested in everybody he shows you,"" Kael wrote.

The movie tells the story of Charlie Driggs (Jeff Daniels), a straight-arrow tax consultant, who is seduced away from his humdrum office life by a hedonistic and charmingly flaky young woman played by Melanie Griffith. Calling herself Lulu, she inveigles him into a road trip that takes the pair from rebellious delight into danger and violence (in the form of Lulu's ex-husband, an ex-con played by Ray Liotta in his movie debut) before its rather pallid Hollywood denouement.

What elevates the ending from disappointing sentiment to a winking, it's-only-a-movie joy is the credit sequence, in which the singer Sister Carol, who plays a minor role in the film, sways against a graffiti-splashed wall and performs a reggae variation on the 1960s standard ""Wild Thing."" The song was one of 49 to be featured in the movie, which also included music by Jimmy Cliff, Oingo Boingo, Fine Young Cannibals and David Byrne of Talking Heads.

Byrne and Demme worked together frequently, notably on ""Stop Making Sense,"" a 1984 concert film about Talking Heads that many critics (and filmgoers) found mesmerizing, though it had few filmic bells and whistles. (Demme preferred to call it a ""performance film"" because, he said, it wasn't about the concert experience — he didn't show the audience until the end.)

Byrne also scored Demme's ""Married to the Mob,"" a gaudy 1988 farce in which Michelle Pfeiffer plays the wife of a Long Island gangster (Alec Baldwin) who tries to exit the mob life after her husband is bumped off when he dallies with the girlfriend of the local boss (Dean Stockwell). Things get especially dicey when she moves with her young son into a shabby Manhattan apartment and strikes up a romance with the FBI agent (Matthew Modine) who has her under surveillance.

In her review of the film, Janet Maslin of The New York Times took note of the mélange of Demme's filmmaking eccentricities — not just the music, ""which drifts mischievously through the film,"" but the details of costume and language and performance that are all pitched to a particular note of fond, giggly amusement.

""Jonathan Demme is the American cinema's king of amusing artifacts: blinding bric-a-brac, the junkiest of jewelry, costumes so frightening they take your breath away,"" Maslin wrote. ""Mr. Demme may joke, but he's also capable of suggesting that the very fabric of American life may be woven of such things, and that it takes a merry and adventurous spirit to make the most of them.""

Robert Jonathan Demme was born on Long Island, in Baldwin, on Feb. 22, 1944, and grew up mostly in nearby Rockville Centre, where he listened to music and went to the movies.

His father, Robert, was a publicist in the travel industry; his mother was the former Dorothy Rogers. (Years later, at age 71, Dorothy Demme appeared in a music video for UB40 and Chrissie Hynde, directed by her son. She later appeared in some of his films, including ""Something Wild"" and ""Philadelphia."" She died in 1995.)

The family moved to Miami, where Jonathan went to high school and worked for a time in a kennel and an animal hospital. Wanting to be a veterinarian, he attended the University of Florida with that in mind until he failed chemistry, at which point he went to the university newspaper, discovered it had no movie critic, and assumed the job himself, he told interviewers, so he could go to the movies with free admission.

He also became a critic for a shopping guide in Coral Gables, for which he wrote a glowing notice for ""Zulu"" (1964), about a bloody 19th-century battle between British soldiers and African warriors, a film whose executive producer was Joseph E. Levine, the founder of Embassy Pictures, the film's American distributor.

It happened that Levine was on vacation in Miami Beach, staying at the Fontainebleau Hotel, where he had become acquainted with the hotel's publicist, Robert Demme. The elder Demme introduced Levine to his son, whose review of ""Zulu"" impressed him. Levine offered him a job.

Demme worked in the Embassy publicity department (the company changed its name to AVCO Embassy in 1967) in New York and also held other jobs in and around the film business, including writing film and music reviews, before moving to London in 1969. There he earned his first film credit, as music coordinator for ""Sudden Terror"" (1970), a thriller about a boy who believes he is being hunted by a killer, for which he corralled several rock bands and put together a score.

In 1971 he took a job as a unit publicist in Ireland for a Roger Corman film, ""Von Richthofen and Brown,"" about a German flying ace. Shortly after that he began making films of his own for Corman's production company. He wrote (with Joe Viola) and produced a biker film, ""Angels Hard as They Come,"" and wrote and directed a handful of others, including ""Caged Heat"" (1974), a heavy-breathing women's prison movie; ""Crazy Mama"" (1975), a campy road story with a '50s rock score that starred Ann Sothern and Cloris Leachman as mother-and-daughter outlaws; and ""Fighting Mad"" (1976), starring Peter Fonda as a farmer battling corrupt land developers in Arkansas.

After several other directors passed on ""Citizens Band,"" a script by Paul Brickman, Paramount hired Demme to direct it.

The movie had the wry humor of François Truffaut, one of Demme's idols, and an interconnected group story that echoed Robert Altman's ""Nashville,"" but it flopped at the box office (both immediately and later, when it was rereleased as ""Handle with Care""). Still, movie insiders recognized the touch of a sly and promising director.

Thom Mount, at the time the head of production at Universal, called Demme to direct ""Melvin and Howard"" after Mike Nichols had dropped out of the project. The movie opened the New York Film Festival and drew rave reviews, a pair of Oscars (for Goldman's script and for Mary Steenburgen's supporting role as Melvin's beleaguered wife) and a best picture citation by the National Society of Film Critics.

Demme's first marriage, to Evelyn Purcell, ended in divorce. He later married Joanne Howard, an artist. She survives him along with three children, Brooklyn, Ramona and Jos. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Demme also had a home in Nyack, New York.

Demme's other films include documentaries about the folk-rock singer and songwriter Neil Young; concert films featuring the country singer Kenny Chesney and the pop star Justin Timberlake; and ""Swimming to Cambodia"" (1987), Spalding Gray's monologue ruminating about Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and his experience appearing in the film ""The Killing Fields.""

Demme was a member of the alternative arts scene of Lower Manhattan, which included Gray, who died in 2004, as well as Byrne and the composer and performer Laurie Anderson, who scored ""Swimming to Cambodia.""

His other narrative features included ""Swing Shift"" (1984), a story about female factory workers during World War II that starred Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Christine Lahti. Demme and Hawn clashed over the film's editing, and the result was a film generally seen as unsatisfying.

Better was ""The Truth About Charlie"" (2002), a well-paced remake of ""Charade,"" the 1963 thriller set in Paris about a woman (Thandie Newton was Demme's stand-in for Audrey Hepburn) pursued by men who are out to reclaim a treasure filched by her husband, who has turned up dead.

And even better was ""Rachel Getting Married"" (2008). Set during a weekend in which Rachel (Rosemary DeWitt), a white woman, is to wed her black fiancé, Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), the film presents a protean and diverse gathering of the two families and various friends within and around the sprawling Connecticut home of Rachel's father (Bill Irwin) and his second wife (Anna Deavere Smith).

The main element of friction in the film is Rachel's sister, Kym (Anne Hathaway), an intelligent and breathtakingly needy young woman who arrives on furlough from nine months in drug rehab.

Filmed in a documentary style with an array of musical genres on the soundtrack — though it is only music that the wedding guests hear — ""Rachel Getting Married"" recalls another Altman film about a similar occasion, ""A Wedding,"" in its piling up of characters and snatches of conversation. It gives viewers a sense of being wedding guests themselves — ""an experience we've all had,"" as the critic Roger Ebert wrote. He added, ""We don't meet everyone at a wedding, but we observe everyone.""

In many ways, ""Rachel Getting Married"" synthesizes the main characteristics and concerns of Demme's body of work. Among the wedding guests are several character actors who make appearances in other Demme films, so there's a family within a family on the screen. And in its obvious but casual multiethnicity, the movie recognizes, with the progressive hopefulness often present in his films, an American whole after providing many close-ups of individual slices.

""It might seem that this tableau is a kind of utopian wish fulfillment, the naive projection of a longed-for harmony that does not yet exist,"" A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. ""To some extent this may be true, but the texture of 'Rachel Getting Married' is so loose and lived in, its faces (many of them belonging to nonprofessional actors) so interesting and real, that it looks more plausibly like a mirror of the way things are.

""It is not that racial division is willed away or made to disappear,"" Scott continued, ""but rather that, on this particular weekend, other matters are more important. A wedding, after all, represents a symbolic as well as an actual union, an intimation of possible perfection in a decidedly imperfect world.""",26/04/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Pinellas County to consider rules for medical marijuana,"CLEARWATER –– The Pinellas County Commission is slated to vote Tuesday on an ordinance to establish rules for growing, processing and selling medical pot in unincorporated areas of the county.

But before the vote, commissioners could hear passionate pleas from critics and supporters of medical marijuana during a 6 p.m. public hearing.

Under the current proposal, medical marijuana dispensaries would not be able to operate within 500 feet of schools, parks, libraries and religious facilities or within 1,000 feet of another marijuana treatment or dispensing facility.

And while users might have the munchies, there won't be any quick fixes. The proposed ordinance prohibits mobile vending, drive-through services and on-site consumption. The businesses would only be allowed to operate between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.

Finally, the dispensaries could only open in certain commercial and manufacturing zones.

The proposal would allow each business entity to operate a marijuana facility to cultivate, process, research and dispense in one zoned district and one retail facility in another district.

The ordinance does not cap the total number of facilities in a zoned district, but each one must meet the separation requirements, said Renea Vincent, director of the Pinellas County Planning Department.

The Pinellas rules are less restrictive than Hillsborough, where dispensaries must be at least 750 feet from schools, parks and other community gathering places, as well as any business that sells alcohol.

Another difference: Growers already approved by the state do not hold an advantage to get a license in Pinellas County.

The Tuesday hearing comes as Florida lawmakers are working to implement the voter-approved constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana. There is still no sign of a compromise between competing House and Senate plans. Officials say they have begun closed-door talks to bridge large divides between their legislation.

Amendment 2, which was approved by 71 percent of voters, allows doctors to recommend marijuana for patients with certain debilitating conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS and post-traumatic stress disorder.

In January, Pinellas commissioners enacted a sixth-month moratorium on medical marijuana facilities in the county.

At the time, a dozen residents spoke up on the proposal — an unusually large number. Supporters worried the moratorium would prevent sick patients from getting medical marijuana. Critics countered that kids would be at risk if marijuana was added to gummy bears, chocolate bars and other food items.

If commissioners approve the ordinance Tuesday, it will negate the moratorium.

Tampa Bay Times,PolitiFact's guide to fake news websites and what they peddle,"At first look, BostonTribune.com certainly seems a trustworthy source. So does KMT11.com. And ABCNews.com.co. Even 24wpn.com has an official ring to it.

But all of these websites peddle bogus stories, either by making up fake news or sharing it from other sources. And it's not always apparent to readers that's the case.

Since December, we at PolitiFact have been partnering with Facebook to root out fabricated reports shared by social media users. As of April 19, we've written more than 80 fact-checks about fake news stories. We've noted some trends along the way, chief among them that it can be really difficult for readers — from casual skimmers to seasoned newshounds — to spot fake news outlets when they pop up.

It's also difficult to determine where these fictional stories come from, and just how they spread across the Internet.

Using our experiences, we've been able to create our own fake news almanac. We want to help readers sort out fact from fiction on their social news feeds, so we compiled a list of every website on which we've found deliberately false or fake news stories since we started working with Facebook — 156 in all. (See PolitiFact's Fake News Almanac at bit.ly/politifactfakes.)

This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it necessarily mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if you see a link being shared from one.

Some websites just want you to click on their pages to generate advertising revenue. Others, it appears, want to reinforce fiercely held political views. And some regular websites apparently get duped by fake news articles, the same as readers.

We've broken the websites on our list down into four broad categories, marked by specific aims and methods for generating or sharing fake news. Let's take a closer look at all four and how they operate.

Parody or joke sites

Many of the deliberately false or fake news stories we see in social media feeds begin on websites that attempt to parody real news — imagine the humor website The Onion, but without the name recognition (or often the comedic writing talent).

It can be difficult to parse what the aims of these parody sites may be. They could be writing stories purely for entertainment, or they may be trolling a particular set of voters. These websites may or may not make it clear on individual links that their stories are fake, but will almost always say in a disclaimer somewhere on their site that their content is exaggerated or fictional.

For example, a Dec. 3, 2016, article on a website called Politicono.com carried the headline, ""Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because 'Santa Was Always White In The Bible.' ""

This story referred to a factual development: Minnesota's Mall of America hiring its first black Santa Claus.

But then it quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America ""into the ground,"" on the basis of Santa ""always having been white in the Bible,"" and, ""No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong.""

The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things. We rated the claim Pants On Fire!

If you look closely enough, Politicono.com admits it makes things up. The site calls itself a ""hybrid news/satire platform,"" taking real news hooks and building fake stories on top of them.

Every article has a ""show facts"" button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. Only the first paragraph about the mall hiring an African-American Santa Claus is real. (Palin was not too pleased about the parody.)

Politicono.com is not alone. It is part of an entire family of similar websites under the Newslo.com umbrella. Similar URLs share reports like this one, including websites like Politicalo.com, Politicot.com, Religionlo.com and Politicops.com.

These are all registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who told us he creates sites for clients, but wouldn't give us much more information than that. Newslo.com is registered in Thessaloniki, Greece, but most of the sister sites belong to an address in Jerusalem.

Being able to identify Sompo as the administrator is an exception, because learning who owns and operates these websites can be exasperatingly difficult. We can look up the owner of any website, but if the buyer has used a proxy service of some kind to buy the domain, there are precious few details about the true owner, or even from which country the site is operated.

That is especially true in the case of our next couple of categories.

News imposter sites

Adding to the fog of fake news online, several websites appear to try to confuse readers into thinking they are the online outlets of traditional or mainstream media sources.

These sites attempt to trick readers into thinking they are newspapers or radio or television stations. Like many other fake news sites, it's very difficult to see who owns them, thanks to private registrations.

We did see that some sites were based in far-flung global locations like Macedonia and Chile. But most imposters we've found so far have set up shop anonymously through domain services like GoDaddy.com.

One such site, CNNews3.com, not only used a web address similar to CNN, but its graphics also deliberately looked almost the same.

The website ran a story on Feb. 6, 2017, that carried the headline, ""HIV virus detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus."" (The website was recently taken down.)

For the record, HIV can't survive outside the human body, so it's not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana. The CNNews3.com story tries to cast doubt on this by noting researchers were puzzled by the banana-borne infections.

We learned this story was a variation of other fake stories of disease-ridden fruit, and this one sprung from a Facebook user posting photos of a malady called mokillo. Mokillo is more colorfully known as finger-tip rot, and can be a problem for banana growers. The disease doesn't harm humans, but it does require banana growers to disinfect farming equipment.

We rated that statement Pants On Fire!

But while that story looked to instill fear to generate shares and clicks, some imposter websites appear to bank more on readers zeroing in on things they want to hear more about.

We found an entire family of sites that created different versions of posts keyed to town names, apparently to generate advertising revenue. These sites have official-sounding names like 16WMPO.com, KY12News.com, Local31News.com and more, posting various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened.

These posts, with only slight variations in details, say a celebrity's car broke down in a particular place, that a celebrity is moving to a certain town or, say, that the next Star Wars movie is being filmed nearby.

The bulk of fake news websites, however, end up peddling their wares in a much more insidious manner.

Fake news sites

There's little consistency of content or style among fake news sites — the common thread appears to be that they distribute fabricated content, but the reasons aren't always apparent.

We have found that almost all of them share or reblog a good deal of content from other sites, either with or without attribution, and much of it is from the sites in the first two categories. They also can potentially create their own false stories, or distribute larger conspiracy theories.

These sites can be based anywhere. While many of them mask their registry information, we've found outlets based across the United States, but also in Canada, Georgia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and, as previously mentioned, Macedonia — a country where teenagers turned fake news into a regular cottage industry during the 2016 election.

One website we've written about was UndergroundNewsReport.com, a fake news site that was started as a joke by an American living in Costa Rica. James McDaniel of Clearwater wanted to fool Donald Trump's supporters, so he attempted to cook up the most outrageous manufactured headlines he could think up.

Instead of fading away into obscurity, the site gained 1 million views in less than two weeks. McDaniel eventually shut the site down once a fake story about Whoopi Goldberg insulting the wife of a slain Navy SEAL drew too much ire from readers who were fooled.

Another prime example of a story that spread across fake news sites was one that said ""first grandma"" Marian Robinson will be getting a $160,000 annual pension after President Barack Obama and his family moved out of the White House.

Bloggers on the websites USPostman.com and ENHLive.com both posted articles around December 2016 that said Robinson will get paid the money for ""services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver"" for watching granddaughters Sasha and Malia.

Of course, there are no such provisions for a first grandmother, and Robinson received nothing. We rated it Pants On Fire!

The original story appeared on BostonTribune.com, a parody site that no longer appears to be working, and found its way to other sites.

The migration shows how joke stories can cause harm even if they are originally labeled as fabricated. Other websites steal them to grind out page views, omitting indications the stories are made up.

Most of these sites join services like Content.ad or RevContent.com that allow them to post a collection of provocative ads to make money off clicks. All the sites really need is content to keep the page views rolling in. While elaborate conspiracy theories and mindless clickbait show up on the pages, completely made-up posts work just as well.

A bogus story like the one concerning Robinson highlighted several ingredients essential to making a fake news story draw readers and go viral: Outrageous claims, partisan rancor, government mechanisms, tax money and the president's family (President Barack Obama, in this case).

Fake news doesn't easily die, either, instead morphing into new stories and propagating its own lies.

Many websites later ran a follow-up about Robinson originally posted on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, an outlet that started as an elaborate ruse in which liberals trolled conservatives with wild, made-up posts looking to inflame the political right.

Fake news sites have flocked to TheLastLineOfDefense.org, appropriating its stories to serve as repurposed content. One story said Robinson was arrested and charged with larceny and fraud for attempting to collect the mythical pension propagated by BostonTribune.com.

That story also was made up, for the record.

Sites that contain some fake news

Finally, some websites appear to get duped like the rest of us.

We have checked statements from sites that appear to carry real content, but contained one or more fake news stories. We don't know whether this is intentional or accidental, but it happens.

One statement we checked was a Feb. 15, 2016, post on UrbanImageMagazine.com, a lifestyle and culture website, that declared that ""300,000 pounds of rat meat sold as chicken wings across America."" We found other instances of the same story elsewhere, too.

The fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China. The rat meat was allegedly filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the Super Bowl.

We rated the statement Pants On Fire! UrbanImageMagazine.com later told us they ""had no idea"" the story was fake.

The story actually came from WorldNewsDailyReport.net, a known peddler of fake articles. The site admits as much in its disclaimer, referring to ""the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.""

Sometimes it's not even the editors of a site that are reposting the fake stuff. Outlets with user-generated content often fall victim, as well.

An example is a post dated Dec. 8, 2015, headlined ""Jimmy Carter: 'Medical marijuana cured my cancer,'"" from CannaSOS.com. The site says it is a social media platform where ""cannabis enthusiasts"" can discuss information related to marijuana.

The story said Carter credited marijuana for curing his cancer, but the fake story appears to have originated from a Dec. 7, 2015, post on a site called SatiraTribune.com. The post even credited the opening line from The Toyes' 1983 weed anthem ""Smoke Two Joints"" to Carter.

There's no disclaimer on the site, but their Facebook page notes that SatiraTribune.com publishes ""satirical and futuristic news.""

We rated this one Pants On Fire!

We had asked CannaSOS.com if they had been aware the story was fiction. An administrator eventually told us that the post was a reader submission, and they were aware it was fake.

But as of this writing, both the CannaSOS.com and UrbanImageMagazine.com posts are still online.

Tampa Bay Times,5 things women need to know,"On the same day the U.S. dropped what's being called the mother of all bombs on Afghanistan, President Donald Trump quietly signed a law that gives states the authority to halt federal funding of family planning services to Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide abortions.

As bombs explode, laws are changed and diplomacy evaporates around the world, it's difficult to keep up with the pace at which the Trump administration's policies are rolled out. Yet advocates for women's rights say now is the time to be vigilant.

Shilpa Phadke, the director of the Women's Initiative at the Center for American Progress, said the first 100 days of the Trump administration have been devastating for women's equality.

""It's just a reminder that after repeated promises that President Trump would protect women and invest in women's health, those words have really nothing behind them,"" said Phadke. ""These actions are creating really damaging consequences for millions of women and really hurting vulnerable communities.

""He's denying women access to family-planning services and lifesaving health care, and we shouldn't be surprised. It's been blow after blow, really.""

Kelly Dittmar, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University - Camden and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, said that though some of the news has been shocking to many women, Trump's actions haven't been surprising to political scientists who watched the campaign.

""Hillary Clinton said this throughout her campaign: 'When somebody shows you who they are, believe them the first time,"" Dittmar said. ""It's a continuance of a pattern of behavior of not prioritizing these issues and, in fact, promoting a brand of leadership and campaigning that was all about masculinity — and going so far as to promote a toxic masculinity that is deriding women.""

Here are five things women — on either side of the aisle — ought to know about the Trump administration's first 100 days:

1 Women in the workplace: Trump revoked the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order in late March, which required wage transparency among federal contractors and banned forced arbitration clauses for sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination claims.

What does that mean?

The law no longer requires companies to be transparent about employee pay, women and minorities have no way of knowing whether their wages are fair, and it also means the government has undercut progress in closing the gender wage gap.

""There's a requirement in there for federal contractors to provide basic information about pay, and that's really critical for women who tend to work in hourly jobs,"" Phadke said.

""Even though there were lots of references to equal pay throughout the campaign, in fact, he's done the opposite. It says to me that President Trump and his team are completely out of touch with today's working families.""

But that's not all this executive order does. Another portion of it involves forced arbitration clauses, also known as cover-up clauses. They allow companies to hide previous cases of sexual assault, harassment and discrimination in the workplace, keeping them out of court and from the public record.

By eliminating the ban on forced arbitration clauses in companies that do business with the government, the Trump administration ""now makes it easier for federal contractors who have chronic violations to keep getting federal funding,"" Phadke said.

2 The Global Gag Rule is back: Just four days after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order to reinstate the Global Gag Rule, also known as the Mexico City Policy, which was introduced in 1984 by then-President Ronald Reagan. The policy prohibits abortion counseling by any nongovernment international organization that receives U.S. federal funding.

Trump reinstated the gag rule, and strengthened it to keep taxpayer dollars from supporting organizations that participate in ""coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization"" and banning ""global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.""

Ann Starrs, president and CEO of the Guttmacher Institute, whose mission is advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights around the world, wrote in an article for The Lancet that the move will disrupt family-planning programs and may lead to more abortions globally.

""The gag rule's main effect has been to reduce women's access to quality contraceptive services, thereby increasing the probability of unintended pregnancy and making recourse to abortion more likely,"" she wrote.

3 Cuts to Planned Parenthood: It was a move lauded by conservatives and anti-abortion activists but roundly denounced by women's rights proponents who argue that the majority of the services Planned Parenthood provides have nothing to do with abortion.

Yet Trump signed an executive order last week allowing states to stop federal dollars to Planned Parenthood and other agencies that provide abortions by cutting their Title X Family Planning Program funding.

What's left out of the conversation is that Planned Parenthood operates 650 health centers around the country, providing family-planning services, pap smears, mammograms, education services, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV tests and more to 2.5 million people — women and men — each year. And it is already against the law for Planned Parenthood or any clinic to use federal dollars for abortion services.

4 Affordable Care Act targeted: As lawmakers scrambled to find a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, one proposal on the table was to cut the requirement that health insurance companies be mandated to cover 10 essential health benefits, including maternity services and preventive health care.

Although Trump nixed the plan, repealing the ACA remains among the president's top priorities.

5 Non-diverse cabinet: What's most telling is what the president hasn't done — and that's appoint women to positions of power.

""Trump's cabinet has just four women,"" Phadke said. ""It's more white and more male than any cabinet since Ronald Reagan's and the women have lower-ranking positions.""

And without diverse numbers of women on his staff, in his cabinet, he is leading without hearing women's voices or learning from their experiences.

""The fear is that this virtual exclusion/ignorance of women's issues and women's broader role as policy leaders will set a precedent for the public sector and for generations of young women,"" Yanus said.

While some people might point to Kellyanne Conway and Omarosa and Ivanka Trump as women in power in Trump's sphere, Dittmar notes that actions speak louder than words.

""People could say, 'Oh, he hired women.' But in his public life on TV, on the campaign trail, all these interactions point to the fact that he doesn't value women,"" she said.",19/04/2017

Tampa Bay Times,"Gilbert Baker, creator of the gay rights rainbow flag, dies at 65","On June 30, 2015, when the White House was transformed by outdoor lighting into a representation of the rainbow, people instantly grasped its significance. It was four days after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision guaranteeing gay couples the right to marry.

The Empire State Building was similarly bathed in rainbow hues, and Niagara Falls was transformed into a cascade of color. More than 25 million people changed their Facebook profile photos to reflect the universal symbol of gay pride.

The rainbow flag that unfurled over a movement and, in many ways, gave it definition and a public identity was the creation of one man, Gilbert Baker.

He designed and sewed the first rainbow flag for a San Francisco gay rights rally in 1978. Baker, who playfully called himself the Betsy Ross of gay liberation, was found dead March 31 at his apartment in New York City.

His death at age 65 was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. A spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office said the cause was heart disease.

After serving as an Army medic and nurse, Baker settled in San Francisco in 1972 and soon became active in the city's gay rights movement. One of the first things he bought was a sewing machine, which he used to make his own clothing - including gowns he wore in occasional appearances as a drag queen.

PHOTOS: Tampa Pride parade takes over Ybor City

""Because I loved to sew, my role in the movement became to make banners,"" Baker told the Refinery29 website in 2015. ""That's really how I ended up making the first flag - I was the guy who could sew it.""

He became friends with Harvey Milk, a member of San Francisco's board of supervisors and one of the country's first openly gay elected officials. Milk suggested to Baker that the gay community needed some kind of recognizable emblem of empowerment.

""I decided that we should have a flag,"" Baker said in a 2015 interview with the Museum of Modern Art, ""that we are a people, a tribe if you will. And flags are about proclaiming power, so it's very appropriate.""

Inspired in part by the U.S. flag, he developed a design of eight brightly colored horizontal stripes: from top to bottom, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, indigo and violet.

""The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things,"" he said in the interview with MoMA, which has included his flag in its design collection. ""Plus, it's a natural flag - it's from the sky!""

With a team of 30 volunteers, Baker soaked strips of cotton muslin in trash cans filled with dye. He then stitched the pieces together to create the first rainbow flag, which measured 30 feet by 60 feet. It was raised on June 25, 1978.

""When it went up and the wind finally took it out of my hands, it blew my mind,"" Baker told CNN two years ago. ""I saw immediately how everyone around me owned that flag. I thought: It's better than I ever dreamed.""

Because it was hard to obtain pink and turquoise fabric, Baker soon altered the flag, eliminating pink altogether and blending turquoise and indigo into a single shade of blue. The most widely used form of the flag now consists of six colors.

The rainbow flag was tantamount to a declaration of independence, a vivid public symbol that gay people would no longer be invisible. For that reason, the flag also became a divisive force in the nation's legal and cultural wars. People went to court to win the right to display it in public.

In November 1978, five months after Baker's first flag was flown, Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated. Baker, who lost many friends to HIV-AIDS, became an increasingly outspoken advocate for gay rights.

Over time, Baker's flag - like the gay rights movement itself - became more widely accepted. Because Baker did not patent his design, he did not profit from its countless commercial adaptations.

Instead, he worked for a San Francisco flag company for several years and later became a freelance designer, creating banners and flags for visiting heads of state, the Democratic National Convention and the Super Bowl.

In 1994, Baker moved to New York, where he created a mile-long rainbow flag that was paraded through the streets on the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which are considered the beginning of the modern gay rights movement.

Eleven years later, in Key West, Florida, Baker made an even larger flag, stretching a mile and a quarter across the island city from the Atlantic Ocean to the Straits of Florida.

""He was a genius at political theater, at political art,"" Jeff Sheehy, a San Francisco city supervisor, told the Chronicle. ""He's one of these heroes who never sought attention for himself. But he was relentless.""

Gilbert Baker was born June 2, 1951, in Chanute, Kansas, and graduated from high school in Parsons, Kan. His father was a lawyer and judge, his mother a teacher. They didn't speak to their son for years after he told them he was gay.

During his Army service, Baker cared for wounded soldiers from the Vietnam War at a military hospital in San Francisco. His harrowing experiences in the Army, where he was often disparaged by drill sergeants and fellow soldiers, were described in Randy Shilts's 1993 book ""Conduct Unbecoming,"" about gay men and women in the military.

In later years, Baker often lectured about gay rights and had exhibitions of photographs and silk screen prints of his rainbow flag. He sometimes dressed in drag under the persona of ""Busty Ross.""

At a White House ceremony in 2016, Baker presented President Barack Obama with a framed copy of his original eight-color flag.

""The rainbow flag is a symbol of freedom and liberation that we made for ourselves,"" Baker said in 2003. ""We all own this flag.""",02/04/2017

Tampa Bay Times,Future of medical pot in Florida still cloudy after Senate discussion,"TALLAHASSEE — What began as a decisive instruction from voters that patients who need medical marijuana should have access to it is shaping up to be a complex and contentious fight in the Florida Capitol.

Lawmakers have put forward competing proposals to implement Amendment 2, which passed with 71 percent of the vote in November and lets patients with debilitating medical conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder use cannabis.

On Wednesday, the Senate's Health Policy panel discussed five approaches to implement the voters' will.

Their deliberations, led by Sen. Dana Young, R-Tampa, revealed the first look at what kind of cannabis bill might pass the Senate — as well as early fault lines.

One clear point of disagreement: how to handle would-be patients with conditions not listed in Amendment 2, which names 10 diagnoses and lets doctors recommend cannabis to patients with similar conditions.

Some advocates and lawmakers have suggested allowing patients with chronic pain access to the drug. But others worry that vague language could make it too easy for people to obtain a doctor's recommendation and a state-issued marijuana patient ID card.

This is one of the two toughest questions facing the Senate, said Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, who sponsored one of the medical marijuana bills (SB 406).

""I don't think we're compelled to include chronic pain that isn't related to an underlying debilitating condition,"" Bradley said.

Lawmakers are also divided on how people should be allowed to consume marijuana under the law.

While a couple of proposals allow for smoking, Bradley is clearly opposed, calling it ""by its very nature not a healthy act."" There are also differing views on edibles, food products that have been infused with cannabis oil.

The Florida House's lone medical marijuana bill (HB 1397) outlines a more restrictive approach, banning smoking and edibles, as well as ""vaping,"" which is allowed under a current law passed in 2014 that lets some patients with severe epilepsy and cancer use cannabis low in euphoric high-inducing THC.

The Senate's eventual proposal will likely keep the structure of Florida's existing, limited medical cannabis program.

""By using this current structure, it would allow the Department of Health to continue with some of its current programs,"" Young said. ""That may lead to a more efficient implementation of the amendment.""

Using the existing program as a starting point will give seven nurseries already licensed to sell cannabis a leg up when the larger, more lucrative medical marijuana industry opens.

It also means that every business that wants to enter the marijuana industry will have to be a one-stop shop, acting as a grower, processer and dispensary.

Just one path (SB 614), filed by Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, allowed for businesses to specialize as growers or sellers. But Young said it is unlikely the Senate will adopt that model because four other senators and the House leadership have endorsed keeping the existing structure.

Other senators on Wednesday raised concerns about this, including Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, who pointed out that it would be difficult for each business to develop expertise in farming, lab work and sales.

But Bradley thinks the existing structure will make it easier to regulate the industry.

""I think it should be seed to store under one roof,"" he said. ""I want to be able to have our government be in the position of shutting down companies that are not good actors and people who do not conduct business appropriately.""

What the Senate does appear ready to change is the number of those companies that will be in the market. Bradley and Young, who originally proposed a slow expansion of the number of marijuana business licenses in the state, now say there should be faster growth to accommodate a patient base of potentially hundreds of thousands.

Businesses and activists repeatedly pressed that point.

""This is just a testament to the fact that we actually do listen to our constituents,"" Young said. ""I do think that more licenses up front and different thresholds will be something that we almost certainly will move to. The question is: How many and at what thresholds?""

Proponents of a more open market took that as a positive sign.

""Even Sen. Bradley, whose proposal started at the lower number in terms of expansion, said up there today he's not only willing to but believes it should be open for others,"" said Ben Pollara, executive director of Florida for Care, the group that pushed Amendment 2 and is now advocating for greater patient access. ""So I feel pretty good about where this thing's headed.""

Tampa Bay Times,"After 2 years, Florida court defines sexual intercourse","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — It took two years and three dictionaries, but the Florida Supreme Court finally determined Thursday that ""sexual intercourse"" isn't just between a man and a woman.

The question arose during a case in which a man was charged with a third-degree felony for failing to reveal to his male partner that he was HIV-positive. His lawyer argued before the state's high court in February 2015 that Florida laws were so narrowly defined that ""sexual intercourse"" didn't apply to sexual activity between same-sex partners or any activity beyond traditional sex.

The court rejected that argument, ruling that the Legislature's goal was clearly to reduce the spread of HIV when it enacted the 1986 law, even if it didn't clearly spell out what it mean by ""sexual intercourse.""

""Because the Legislature did not define 'sexual intercourse' ... we look to the dictionary in order to ascertain the plain and ordinary meaning of the term,"" the court wrote in the unanimous decision before quoting three dictionaries. The plain meaning of sexual intercourse clearly encompasses ""acts beyond penile-vaginal intercourse,"" the court said.

The court wrote that gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected by the spread of HIV and said the disclosure law wasn't meant to be restricted to sex between men and women.

The case was brought after Gary Debaun was charged in 2011 with not disclosing that he was HIV-positive before having sex with his partner. Court records show Debaun's partner asked him to take an HIV test, and that Debaun, who knew he was infected, provided fake results showing he was free of the virus that causes AIDS.

A lower court threw out the charge, but it was reinstated upon appeal. The case will now go back to the trial court.

""It's been a long time coming,"" said Assistant State Attorney Colleen Dunn, who originally brought the charges against Debaun in Key West nearly six years ago. ""When they created this statute, they never thought that a definition of sexual intercourse would come into such play.""

In Florida, it is a separate offense to transmit HIV if a person aware of their infection doesn't reveal it before sexual intercourse. Dunn said Debaun hasn't been charged with infecting his partner.

Debaun's attorney, Brian Ellison, wouldn't comment on the specifics of the ruling.

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DEFINES 'SEXUAL INTERCOURSE'

It took two years and three dictionaries, but the Florida Supreme Court finally determined today that ""sexual intercourse"" isn't just between a man and a woman. The question arose during a case out of Key West in which a man was charged with a third-degree felony for failing to reveal to his male partner that he was HIV-positive. His lawyer argued before the state's high court in February 2015 that Florida laws were so narrowly defined that ""sexual intercourse"" didn't apply to sexual activity between same-sex partners or any activity beyond traditional sex. The state rejected that argument.

TRUMP UNVEILS BUDGET: BUILD UP MILITARY, BUILD THE WALL

President Donald Trump unveiled a $1.15 trillion budget today, proposing a far-reaching overhaul of federal spending that would slash many domestic programs to finance a big increase for the military and make a down payment on a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump's plan seeks to upend Washington with cuts to long-promised campaign targets like foreign aid and the Environmental Protection Agency as well as strong congressional favorites such as medical research, help for homeless veterans and community development grants. Here's an agency-by-agency look at how Trump's proposed budget would affect individual government agencies.

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TROUBLED GOP HEALTH CARE BILL

The House Budget Committee voted narrowly today to advance the troubled Republican health care bill, with defections by three GOP conservatives underscoring the obstacles party leaders face in maneuvering to avoid a stinging setback to their showpiece legislation.

Tampa Bay Times,"Stage Planner: 'Something Rotten!' opens at the Straz, Florida Orchestra does Dalí","STINKS

SO GOOD: SOMETHING ROTTEN

It's 1595, and two playwrights, Nick and Nigel Bottom, are desperate to compete with their contemporary, William Shakespeare. They launch a concept no one has heard of or can understand — the musical. That's the foundation of Something Rotten!, a musical comedy opening Tuesday at the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts.

""I was so pleasantly surprised when I got the job,"" said Adam Pascal, above, who plays Shakespeare. ""The responses have been amazing. The show is so clever and funny and well-written.""

Pascal, 46, knows a little about game-changing musicals. In the mid 1990s, he was working as a personal trainer and playing in rock bands when a friend suggested he try out for a new musical, a reshaping of the opera La Boheme in the age of AIDS.

In 1996 he cracked the original cast of Rent, a body of interwoven stories so grippingly confrontational and current, it deepened the repertoire. Pascal's portrayal of HIV-positive rock guitarist Roger Davis showcased a stylistically versatile tenor voice and a comic touch, earning a Tony nomination.

That performance immediately led to a string of other Broadway roles. In Aida, Elton John and Tim Rice's adaptation of the Verdi opera, he played the Egyptian general Radamus, opposite fellow Rent alum Idina Menzel. He starred as the emcee in a 2003 revival of Cabaret, and played other roles in Memphis and Chicago.

Those experiences make Pascal an understandable choice for Something Rotten!, an imaginative quantum leap beyond the long-running Forbidden Broadway, currently running at the adjacent Jaeb Theater. The medium Nostradamus spells out its premise early and in unusually specific terms, namely that the task of competing with Shakespeare was so daunting, it would require an equally out-of-the-box response, namely ""singing, dancing and acting at the same time.""

The Bottom brothers decide to give the form a try. Their work-in-progress intrigues the other villagers, even if they find it absurd.

The book by Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell, and the music and lyrics by brothers Wayne and Karey Kirkpatrick, give Shakespeare a not-so-flattering makeover, an idea the Kirkpatricks and O'Farrell had been kicking around since college 20 years ago.

""The basic idea is, musicals had never been done before,"" Pascal said. ""And the thing about Shakespeare in our production is, he is an arrogant, silly buffoon who is certainly not above stealing other people's work. He's incredibly threatened by what's happening with these guys, and realizes that the musical that they're working on is not the next great idea — but one of them is working on this other show, which turns out to be Hamlet. And he's trying to steal that idea.""

Despite his enjoyment in the irreverent look at Broadway's origins, Pascal believes musicals will endure.

""You're seeing people take amazing risks with wonderful payoffs,"" he said. ""Clearly Hamilton is the biggest indicator of that. There is that element of a Disneyesque, hyped kind of show. But I think there are a lot of people writing things that are very cutting-edge. And there are producers who are willing to take a chance.""

7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and March 9; 8 p.m. March 10; 2 and 8 p.m. March 11; and 2 and 7:30 p.m. March 12. 1010 N MacInnes Place, Tampa. $31 and up. (813) 229-7827. strazcenter.org.

Tampa Bay Times,"Florida Strawberry Festival guide: Schedule, ticket deals, food highlights, concerts and more","The Florida Strawberry Festival, founded in 1930, keeps its old-fashioned charm with an 80-ride midway, contests, agriculture exhibits and of course, strawberries in every form. There's no alcohol and festival organizers pride themselves on family-friendly, even corny, diversions and contests. The formula must work because the Plant City festival remains the second-largest in the state, just behind the Miami-Dade County Fair, and drew a record 560,387 visitors in 2016. Here are some basics if you head to this year's Florida Strawberry Festival:

Admission: $10, $5 ages 6 to 12, 5 and younger free. Concert tickets are extra.

Dates: March 2 through March 12.

Hours: 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Directions: The festival grounds are at 303 N Lemon St., Plant City. Every year, Interstate 4 comes to a crawl in Plant City, especially on the weekends or before a big concert. Avoid I-4 by taking State Road 60 through Brandon and using local roads. Find detailed directions for back roads here: tbtim.es/egv

Parking: There are three designated lots on the festival grounds, and numerous private lots and yards surrounding the festival for $5 to $15 depending on vehicle size.

EVENT HIGHLIGHTS

Smoothie record attempt: On Friday, Cabot Creamery will attempt to set a world record with a 1,000-gallon smoothie. Their tent near Gate 1 will use 250 gallons of vanilla yogurt mixed with ice, whey protein powder and 2,000 pounds of strawberries. For added showmanship, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., special guests will pedal bicycles in 15 minute intervals to power the Vitamix blenders whirring the 1,000-gallon holding tank. A $1 donation to the United Food Bank gets you a commemorative cup and a smoothie after the record is reached.

Contests: There are six different food contests over the 11-day festival including a corn dog eating contest March 8, a strawberry spaghetti eating contest (that's spaghetti in a strawberry sauce) on Monday, March 6, and strawberry shortcake eating on March 9. The kids compete on Sunday to be the first stemmer to pick all the green parts off a pack of berries. Adults will be speed-stemming on Tuesday.

Parades: The Youth Parade begins at 11 a.m. Saturday, March 4 and runs down Reynolds Street on the south end of the fairgrounds. Grand Parade Day is Monday, when the parade passes the festival grounds around 2 p.m.

FOOD

All about that berry: Plan to pick up a flat of berries because the Plant City farmers pride themselves on sending the very best strawberries to the festival. For more berry goodness, the festival is famous for its strawberry milk shakes, strawberry pie, a strawberry dessert pizza and the famous strawberry shortcake. The shortcake lines may be long, but they move swiftly. There's also odd takes on the berry, like Carousel's hamburger topped with crumbles of strawberry cookies, sandwiched between two pieces of French toast and topped with strawberries. And you can find strawberry lemonade, strawberry-flavored kettle corn and peanut brittle with a sweet strawberry twist.

Fair food: New this year are the deep-fried strawberry cream cheese balls topped with powdered sugar from Best Around Concessions. That stand is also bringing back the Oreo funnel cake (think two giant Oreo cookie funnel cakes sandwiching a cream cheese filling). Carousel's Hush Puppy Burger is back this year, buns replaced by hush puppy patties. Carousel also has a burger that uses strawberry shortcakes as buns. The popular Amish doughnut stand pushes out dinner plate-sized wheels of yeasty fried dough. Other returning favorites include roasted corn, giant turkey legs, massive pretzels, a variety of corn dogs and thick slices of bacon with a cup of chocolate dipping sauce.

CONCERTS SCHEDULE

This year's headline music performers include Willie Nelson and Family (March 3, 3:30 p.m.), early aughts stars 3 Doors Down (March 4, 7:30 p.m.), country band Little Big Town (March 5, 7:30 p.m.), rockers Needtobreath (March 7, 7:30 p.m.), country crooner Scotty McCreery (March 8, 7:30 p.m.), Dan Aykroyd and Jim Belushi as The Blues Brothers (March 9, 7:30 p.m.), Ex's & Oh's singer Elle King (March 10, 7:30 p.m.), the legendary Patti LaBelle (March 11, 7:30 p.m.) and country superstars Rascal Flatts (March 12, 7:30 p.m.).

Tampa Bay Times,Friday's letters: Proceed with care on marijuana,"Rules on pot fall short | Jan. 27, editorial

Proceed with care on marijuana

If Amendment 2 on medical marijuana was being ignored, the Department of Health would have done nothing. Instead, the department has taken a dramatic stance that expands access to marijuana and has unilaterally stated that physicians can now order it for those conditions identified in the amendment.

The department does not have the authority to wipe away statutes that were put in place explicitly to handle the complexity of issues dealing with a substance that is still illegal at the federal level. The agency cannot, for example, issue an edict allowing anyone to grow marijuana or to sell it as that person sees fit. It cannot simply wipe away the licensure requirements. Instead, the department has allowed the current statutory framework for growing, distributing and selling to stand and additionally took the bold step of allowing physicians to immediately begin ordering marijuana for a very wide group of patients.

We must move forward slowly and cautiously. We have seen what happens in states like California where a small crack in the door has made a mockery of so-called ""medical marijuana"" laws. Reports there tell of so-called doctors walking through parks and along beaches selling ""medical marijuana"" cards to anyone who pays a small fee.

It is imperative that we balance access with public health and public safety, and that will require a steady hand and thoughtful approach.

Calvina Fay, Executive Director, Drug Free America Foundation, St. Petersburg

Immigration

Wall is smoke and mirrors

Building a wall to stop illegal immigration when it is at the lowest level in decades? Who is leading the effort and providing the mature thought processes? With all the priorities for this country, how does this rise to the top of the list?

Mexico is our third-largest trading partner, and Hispanics/Latinos make up 17 percent of our population. If we are concerned about illegal immigration, why don't we incarcerate the small businessmen who hire illegals? I know several small businessmen who do in fact hire illegals while complaining about government regulations. This contradiction in values continues to baffle me. I am as pro-business as the next person, but following rules must be done even when it doesn't benefit you.

If we fund a wall with import fees, isn't this a tax on the Americans who elected the current president? Did those voters agree to this hidden tax? Did these voters agree to higher costs for vegetables, fruits, cars, etc? How does that help our consumers?

Why would we attack a neighboring democratic country that is friendly and non-threatening, while cuddling with a country that has an autocratic ruler who meddles in multiple countries' elections and whose interests/core values are fundamentally different than our own? Russia does not even make the list of the top 20 trading partners. Belgium, Thailand, Colombia and Chile are all larger trading partners than Russia. We have a new leadership that claims to be pro-business. Who is doing the math here?

Why is the president so interested in forgiving everything that Russia/Vladimir Putin does? I suggest that the news media ""follow the money"" to uncover what the underlying interests are. The wall is yet another smoke-and-mirrors effort.

Mike Hughes, Dunedin

Will I be next?

As a Canadian, I spent almost five years and about $30,000 on legal fees to obtain a green card. I was thoroughly vetted, with tests for HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases. All the courses I took for my MBA and college degrees were checked to make sure they were equivalent to U.S.-based university courses. Every organization I belonged to was researched, right back to my days in the Boy Scouts. Even my local Chamber of Commerce had to submit a report. Every employer was called to make sure I had not lied about my qualifications. After all this and numerous personal interviews (with travel at my expense), I am worried.

I have paid taxes for 14 years and never had any legal issues. I am now wondering if President Donald Trump's executive action can be used to bar me from returning to the United States from vacation. Will I have to abandon my home, my friends and my business because I don't belong to the right religion, club or country? Will I get caught in the crosshairs as Trump ""negotiates"" a new NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico? Am I next?

Gasparilla

A striking lack of diversity

I have fond memories of the Gasparilla ""invasions"" of my childhood. I eventually moved to Atlanta and now live in New Orleans. For old time's sake, I watched WFLA-Ch. 8's webcast of this year's parade down Bayshore Boulevard.

Sometimes it takes an outside observer to offer an opinion that might be overlooked. And it saddens me to realize that the centerpiece event of my hometown is a very, very white parade. I'm a filmmaker who has worked on many civil rights documentaries, and the image Tampa is presenting to the world would never fly in ""the ATL,"" not to mention New Orleans.

Other than a passing marching band, I saw no diversity on the route, other than WFLA's cameraman. None. I saw not one woman of color other than one Rays cheerleader. I saw no people of color on any of the floats.

I'm white, and this deeply saddens me. May I respectfully ask parade marchers: Don't you have any black friends? Any? To the organizers with the floats: Don't you have any co-workers of color? From India? The Caribbean? Any? Even people you only know halfway who might enjoy being invited?

You ought to work on that, if only for personal enlightenment.

Let me remind the Tampa Visitors Bureau that this is 2017. In a nation of ever-growing diversity you are on display to the world, and your optics are terrible. To Gasparilla paraders, may I respectfully suggest you make some new friendships this year and broaden the diversity in your lives. Then hit the street in 2018 with party cups in hand and have a good — maybe even a great — time. And smile for the camera.

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Voter intent on medical marijuana ignored,"The Florida Department of Health's first draft of rules authorizing medical marijuana falls far short of what is prescribed in the voter-approved constitutional amendment. State regulators are proposing only a limited expansion of Florida's existing program and an unwarranted restriction on which patients can access it. Amendment 2, approved by more than 70 percent of voters, legalizes marijuana for people with an array of ailments, and the state is obligated to craft a program that ensures access to it.

Before the constitutional change took effect Jan. 3, Florida allowed terminally ill patients to use full-strength marijuana and certain other patients to use a strain low in THC to alleviate pain and other symptoms. Seven growers are authorized to produce and sell marijuana for the entire Florida market. With the approval of Amendment 2, full-strength marijuana is legal for patients with several conditions specified in the ballot language, such as cancer, HIV, glaucoma and PTSD, or ""other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated, and for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient.""

That means it should be up to a patient's doctor to determine whether marijuana would be an appropriate treatment. But the Department of Health's proposed rules say the drug should be legal only for the ailments specified plus those approved by the state Board of Medicine. Amendment 2 makes no mention of the Board of Medicine, and the rule that is ultimately adopted should conform with the clear intent of the amendment.

The proposed rules also stick with the current number of seven growers authorized to sell medical marijuana, even though Florida's market is poised to gain hundreds of thousands of customers. The rules don't allow separate entities to grow, produce and distribute marijuana products, adhering to the current ""vertical integration"" model that requires growers to be equipped to service the entire supply chain from seed to storefront. Legislation filed by Sen. by Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, goes a little further, requiring that five more growers be licensed within six months of there being 250,000 patients in the state. The Health Department's proposals maintain the status quo that stymies competition and growth, and Bradley's bill does not do enough to change that.

Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, is set to file a bill that would loosen that stranglehold while still requiring sensible regulation. Brandes proposes creating four separate licenses — for growers that cultivate the plants, processors that produce and package the products, retailers that sell them and transportation companies that deliver them to patients. Companies could obtain one or all four licenses for a one-stop shopping business model. There would be no limit on the number of growers in the state, letting the market determine how many Florida can support. Doctors would decide whether patients should be certified to use medical marijuana. On the regulation side, processors would be required to make products that look like medicine — no gummy bears — and are sold in clearly labeled packaging. Smokable marijuana would be allowed.

As several counties and municipalities have implemented moratoriums on medical marijuana storefronts, Brandes' bill would cede considerable control to local governments to restrict the number and location of retail outlets. But it would prohibit a cap on delivery-only facilities that don't sell directly to the public. The broad concepts in Brandes' bill, which is supported by the Florida for Care advocacy group, would provide a sound foundation for an industry that Floridians clearly want.

By defaulting to the limited medical marijuana program already on the books in Florida, the Department of Health is not following the intent of Amendment 2. Florida needs a comprehensive rewrite of existing regulations that reflects the will of the voters.",26/01/2017
Tampa Bay Times,"Backed by voters, medical marijuana laws start to take shape in Capitol","TALLAHASSEE — Jacel Delgadillo is still waiting for her 5-year-old son Bruno to be able to use medical marijuana legally in Florida.

Bruno suffers from a rare form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. When he started using cannabis, Bruno went from having hundreds of seizures a week to fewer than five. Though voters in November overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment that eases access to medical marijuana, Delgadillo frets that lawmakers are reversing course, hashing out plans that would further limit access to the drug.

Seventy-one percent of voters approved the measure, but it's ""something completely different"" than what lawmakers are now considering, said Delgadillo, who lives in Miami.

She worries Florida's laws will ban edibles and smoking the drug — so-called whole-plant use that she says voters expected to be legal. Caps on the number of businesses that can grow and sell the drug might limit the variety of cannabis available to her son, she said.

In recent weeks, the state Senate and the Florida Department of Health released proposals that would mostly keep control of the marijuana market in the hands of a few companies licensed to grow marijuana, process it and sell oils and pills to patients. Leaders in the Florida House, which have not yet released a plan, say they are inclined to do the same.

Instead of creating a whole new marijuana system, the Senate and health department proposed adding new patients to an existing, limited program passed two years ago. It allows terminally ill people to use full-strength marijuana and certain patients, including children with severe epilepsy, to use strains of cannabis low in the chemical THC, which causes a high.

Rules proposed by the health department ahead of public hearings across the state would allow only the seven currently licensed growers to produce and sell medical marijuana to the larger market. They also want to restrict marijuana's use to a list of specific medical conditions including cancer and HIV and require that the state Board of Medicine approve any changes, though Amendment 2 gives doctors freedom to recommend the drug when they think it is appropriate.

State Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, proposed allowing the current growers to run the market. But his bill (SB 406) requires that five additional growers be licensed within six months of there being 250,000 patients in the state.

The Florida House, which has not yet made public its medical marijuana plan, is thinking along similar lines, said Health Quality Chairman Cary Pigman, an ER doctor, but with a much more rapid expansion in the number and diversity of growers.

""I would imagine we're going to get to over 100,00 pretty quickly,"" Pigman, R-Avon Park said. ""I think there's a lot of pent-up demand, and we're going to see that expand pretty rapidly.""

So far, neither the state nor the Legislature has show interest in allowing businesses to specialize on growing, producing marijuana products or selling.

That might be okay in the beginning, said Andrew Freedman, Colorado's former marijuana czar. But in the long run, it could be less efficient and give growers more influence in Tallahassee.

""I would expect to see better lobbying teams if you have only a few,"" he said to a lobbyist-packed room in the state Capitol. ""You will feel greater pressure.""

Critics worry the current growers may not be able to supply enough marijuana for a market that could expand from fewer than 2,000 patients now to hundreds of thousands of users under Amendment 2.

Ben Pollara, who managed the Amendment 2 campaign, said the health department's rules are ""in direct contradiction"" of the state Constitution and that the Senate is off to ""an encouraging start."" But he's wary of laws limiting the number of growers and preventing companies from focusing only on growing, selling or extracting the chemicals to make cannabis oils and pills.

""You're not going to have a diverse set of products for these patients,"" he told the Times/Herald. ""And the person or persons who might be best equipped to grow the best marijuana may not be the best equipped to do the best extractions.""

Tampa Bay Times,Seminole passes moratorium on medical marijuana,"SEMINOLE — Council members passed a temporary moratorium on the sale of medical marijuana in the city, following suit with several local governments anticipating the effects of a constitutional amendment that would expand use of the drug.

The ordinance, passed unanimously on first reading, would restrict sales until July, the deadline for legislators to come up with rules to regulate the industry. The amendment, passed with 71 percent of voters' support in the November election, allows doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to people with debilitating conditions, such as HIV/AIDS and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mark Ely, the city's community development director, told council members that he has already written a draft ordinance with guidelines for marijuana dispensaries that includes rules for surrounding distance, hours of operation and security.

""The (legislative) session starts in March and ends in May,"" he said. ""We'll have a good idea coming out of that what legislation will allow us to touch and not touch.""

Tampa Bay Times,A look at how Pinellas County is spending BP settlement money,"Dollars have been doled out across Pinellas County following months of deliberations on how to spend the $7.1 million settlement from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. County commissioners chose to split the money among 28 projects, ranging from health causes to artistic efforts to infrastructure and more. Here's the breakdown on each:

• Pinellas County Housing Trust Fund

BP funds awarded: $1 million

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: This $1 million will go toward the agency's general mission of providing funds for the development of affordable housing units countywide. The fund contributes to construction financing, down payment assistance and rehabilitation projects.

• Pinellas County | stormwater/sewage

BP funds awarded: $1 million

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: This money will be used to address countywide stormwater and sewer infrastructure issues. After the massive dumping of sewage by municipalities and accidental overflow through manholes during Hurricane Hermine this past summer, the county formed a task force to evaluate next steps. One recommendation has been to conduct a first-ever intrusion and infiltration study of problem areas to plan for specific upgrades.

• PSTA, St. Petersburg

BP funds awarded: $589,000

Additional funds needed: none

Project: PSTA will build an electric bus charging station in downtown. It is now buying two zero-emission buses. The six-month pilot trial will determine future expansion to replace diesel buses currently in use.

• Creative Pinellas, Largo

BP funds awarded: $500,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: The nonprofit arts agency will use the funds to take traveling sculptures and installations on a tour of multiple locations over the next three years before placing them in permanent spaces.

• East Lake Community Library

BP funds awarded: $350,000

Additional funds needed: $0

Project: A new parking lot will be installed between the library and its neighbor, Cypress Woods Elementary School, to increase space for visitors and safety for students. Engineers are still deciding on the design, but library director Lois Eannel says she hopes to see 30-40 spots added. The money will also cover landscaping, lighting and fencing. The library will be responsible for upkeep and maintenance.

• Pinellas County | Cross Bay Ferry

BP funds awarded: $350,000

Additional funds needed: $0

Project: The dollars cover Pinellas County's share of the high-speed pilot program between the Vinoy Basin in downtown St. Petersburg and the Tampa Convention Center in downtown Tampa. Other funding partners include the cities of Tampa and St. Petersburg and Hillsborough County.

• Community Service Association Palm Harbor

BP funds awarded: $294,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: A little more than 2 acres of a vacant and wooded 4-acre parcel, owned by the county and leased by the association, will be developed for athletic fields.

• Pinellas County | sports parks

BP funds awarded: $284,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: Three new youth sports parks will be designed for the Seminole Junior Warhawks Athletic Association in unincorporated Seminole.

• Wounded Warriors Abilities Ranch, Pinellas Park

BP funds awarded: $250,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: Lurie Park will be developed to offer adaptive recreation and sports activities for disabled military veterans and others with limited physical abilities.

• City of Dunedin

BP funds awarded: $250,000

Additional funds needed: $1,150,000

Project: The city purchased a nearly 8-acre piece of land adjacent to Hammock Park to save it from development following residents' outcry last year. The purchase was funded by an interest-bearing loan from the city utilities fund, and the money from the county will help repay part of it.

• Pinellas County | rescue boats

BP funds awarded: $250,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: The county will use these funds to buy a rescue boat for East Lake and supplement the purchase of a boat for the city of St. Pete Beach.

• Downtown Palm Harbor Merchants Association

BP funds awarded: $222,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: The money will pay for landscaping and the purchase of 66 street lights to install alongside 10 that have already been purchased.

• City of Safety Harbor

BP funds awarded: up to $250,000

Additional funds needed: up to $250,000

Project: The county and the city have both committed to spend up to $250,000 to split the cost of a new bridge near Philippe Park, 2525 Philippe Parkway. The geometric design of the bridge that currently connects N Bayshore Drive to the south end of the park makes it difficult for bikers and runners to use, limiting access for some residents. The bridge will be wider, giving more residents access, while still deterring those riding motorized vehicles from using it. The change will allow the city to use the bridge for community races without having to shut down Philippe Parkway.

• Metro Wellness Center, St. Petersburg

BP funds awarded: $150,000

Additional funds needed: $1,850,000

Project: Metro Wellness Center is a health organization that promotes diversity and offers a variety of services to the LGBT community, including free HIV/AIDS testing, medical care, counseling and social programs. The funds will help offset the cost of the acquisition and renovation of a building at 3251 Third Ave. N. The space will serve as the new headquarters and help the organization continue to push HIV/AIDS prevention in Pinellas. More than $700,000 of the additional money needed has been raised. Donations can be made at metrotampabay.org.

• Veterans Memorial Plaza at Crest Lake Park, Clearwater

BP funds awarded: $150,000

Additional funds needed: $350,000

Project: The Tampa Bay Veterans Alliance in May unveiled a circular, brick Veterans Memorial Plaza in Crest Lake Park, but is now raising funds for the second phase. The group is working to build six bronze statues and additional walls for veterans' names as a tribute to the 50,000 service members living in North Pinellas. The project would also launch a children's scholarship and a fund for surviving veteran spouses in need.

• Pinellas County | Gulf passes

BP funds awarded: $150,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: As both the Grand Canal and Shell Key passes in the Gulf of Mexico near Tierra Verde grow narrower, the money will pay for an inlet management study to assess the problem and determine a solution.

• Happy Workers Children's Center, St. Petersburg

BP funds awarded: $150,000

Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: Happy Workers, which has provided child care and preschool to children in south St. Petersburg for nearly 90 years, will use its funds to divide an existing room in the 100-year-old Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. building into two smaller rooms, interior painting, replace the carpet and renovate the kitchen. The funds may also be used to serve an additional 15 3-year-olds and hire two preschool teachers.

• Be Safe Inc., Clearwater

BP funds awarded: $125,000

Additional funds needed: none

Project: Be Safe, the fundraising arm for the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 11-1, will buy the building at 510 N Fort Harrison Ave. to use as a training center. The Clearwater flotilla is the only unit in Division 11, which spans Madeira Beach to Hudson, without a training center. The 70-member volunteer group assists the Coast Guard in water patrols, search and rescue, public affairs and environmental work.

• Golden Generations, St. Petersburg

BP funds awarded: $100,000

Additional funds needed: First year operational cost $326,474

Project: Golden Generations has renovated a home in St. Petersburg's Lake Maggiore neighborhood to house four women aging out of the foster care system and help them transition to adulthood. Each will receive job training, money management help and emotional support. The My Sistah's Place program will create a waiting list for the 18- to 24-month program and work with employers and mentors to follow residents after their stays.

• Tampa Bay Estuary Program, St. Petersburg

BP funds awarded: $100,000

Additional funds needed: $100,000

Project: The program will use its BP funds to study the hard marine floor in Pinellas County using sonar. While scientists have extensive data on sea grass beds, no studies have been done on the area's limestone ledges, leaving little information about what types of marine life live there. Once data is collected, researchers hope to be able to better preserve and protect this ecosystem.

• City of Gulfport

BP funds awarded: $100,000

Additional funds needed: $250,000

Project: Gulfport is planning a mooring field in Boca Ciega Bay to combat unregulated anchoring by boaters, which has contributed to destruction of sea grass colonies and degradation of water quality due to improper trash and sewage disposal. The mooring field would create 25 buoys and accommodate boats up to 60 feet long.

• Clearwater Ferry

BP funds awarded: $80,000 | Additional funds needed: n/a

Project: The private water taxi, launched in March 2015 to connect the mainland and Clearwater Beach, will use BP funds for maintenance and upgrades on its three vessels. In November, the city of Clearwater approved a two-year, $439,820 subsidy for the business. Officials say the public-private partnership is needed to reduce vehicle congestion on Clearwater Beach.

• Greater Mount Zion AME Church, St. Petersburg

BP funds awarded: $90,000

Additional funds needed: $21,600

Project: Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Gulfport, an African-American burial ground for Civil War veterans and private citizens, has suffered neglect over the years.

Tampa Bay Times,Pinellas County considers moratorium on medical marijuana,"CLEARWATER--Amid passionate pleas from residents, Pinellas County commissioners took the first step Tuesday to consider enacting a sixth-month moratorium on medical marijuana facilities in the county.

With a tentative ordinance being considered, 12 residents offered reasons why commissioners should pass and reject the proposal. It's rare for 12 residents to speak on any issue before the board.

Supporters worried the moratorium could delay getting medical marijuana into the hands of sick patients. Critics countered that children would be at risk if marijuana was added to gummy bears, chocolate bars and other food items.

""Our family should not have to wait one more day because of politics,"" said Clearwater mother Dani Hall, whose two autistic sons would use the drug. ""We will never stop fighting for our kids.""

But a local leader of Drug Free America disagreed.

""Our concern is with public health and safety,"" said Amy Ronshausen, deputy director of the organization.

Commissioners will vote Jan. 24 after residents offer input at a second hearing.

Several residents urged commissioners to not forget that 75 percent of Pinellas voters approved the law in November.

Amendment 2, which was added to the state Constitution with 71 percent of voters' support in November, allows doctors to recommend marijuana for patients with a long list of debilitating conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The amendment's passing started the clock on a six-month deadline for the Florida Department of Health to set rules governing the program.

Commissioner Ken Welch cautioned that medical marijuana in Florida is new for all residents.

""We're not trying to defeat the will of the voters,"" Welch said. ""You're watching us make sausage up here. The voters have spoken.""

Commissioner Pat Gerard agreed, saying: ""I'm in favor of allowing it to be available as soon as possible.""

County staffers cautioned that the ordinance would not supersede any statewide rules that could come from the Florida Legislature of the state Department of Health.

Local leaders are more concerned with zoning requirements for prospective business locations, said county administrator Mark Woodard. He expects to have a set of guidelines for commissioners to consider in March or April.

The ordinance would only apply to unincorporated areas of Pinellas County.",10/01/2017
Tampa Bay Times,Friday's letters: Opportunities for medical advances with Cuba,"Cuba

Bioscience opportunities abound

In this time of rapidly evolving changes in relations between the United States and Cuba, there are tremendous opportunities for business. And there may be no greater area of opportunity for Cuba-Tampa Bay relations than in bioscience and medicine.

Tampa Bay has one of the most sophisticated and advanced medical and bioscience communities in the nation. One way to strengthen the region's medical and biotech industry is to collaborate with Cuba. As a past board chair of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce, I led several delegations to Cuba to discuss issues of importance to both sides, including transportation, culture, business and medicine. During those trips, I saw firsthand the many ways in which Cuba is advancing medical technology.

Researchers in Cuba have developed a promising lung cancer treatment and vaccine, known as CimaVax, that's been available to Cuban citizens since 2011. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's trip to Cuba in 2015 led to an agreement to bring CimaVax to the United States, and U.S. facilities are evaluating the treatment for use here.

Last year, Cuba also became the first country to receive World Health Organization validation that it had eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. The WHO director-general called the development ""one of the greatest public health achievements possible.""

But current restrictions are holding Cuba back from making even more medical progress. Because of the U.S. embargo against Cuba and other restrictions in this country and in Cuba, Cuban medical institutions are sometimes unable to get crucial equipment, parts and pharmaceuticals.

Since we're geographically close to Cuba, scientists and doctors from the Tampa Bay area could travel to Havana to meet with Cuban experts and work together on studies, research projects and other health advances. Residents, fellows and doctors from Cuba could travel here for classes, professional training and continuing education. And since Tampa Bay is a center for state-of-the-art medical care, we could also play host to patients from Cuba seeking specialized treatments.

Cuba is a country of over 11 million people. It's foolish to shut ourselves off to the many medical opportunities that exist. Let's start 2017 by fostering more engagement between the medical industry in Tampa Bay and Cuba by exchanging research, data and information. These partnerships are about treating people, curing diseases and overall public health. They are issues that should have no boundaries, geographic or political. We can't let politics stand in the way of medical progress.

Open carry

Guns only add to danger

The lives of Florida's children and teens are at risk if SB 140 passes. It is a dangerous, extreme bill that will lead to open carry on school and college campuses. It is sponsored by Sen. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota. Polls show that students, faculty and campus law enforcement overwhelmingly oppose guns on campus. When guns on campus was considered last session, the Florida State University police chief noted that it would make his officers' job considerably more challenging by forcing them to differentiate between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys.""

College life is all about young people under high pressure, and many take risks with drug and alcohol use. Easy access to guns only heightens these safety risks. There is no evidence to support gun lobby claims that guns protect students from crime. To the contrary, alcohol directly impairs judgment on whether to fire a gun.

We should be strengthening laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people — and stop school shootings before they happen. The only people carrying guns in our schools should be trained law enforcement and trained security guards.

Seek scientific explanations | Jan. 2, letter

Searching for a purpose

The letter writer misreads Ross Douthat's recounting of the near-death experiences of professed atheists. Douthat never claims that these experiences are beyond scientific explanation. Rather, he describes how, when confronted with the unexplained, even the most hardened atheist may begin to question the conviction that God does not exist.

The sciences have a great deal to teach us about our material world and the universe in which it resides. Those disciplines, however, cannot explain the ultimate question: What is our purpose in this ever-expanding, beautiful, ordered and mysterious cosmos? For Douthat, and countless others around the world, the answer is found in ""God's love for us"" and in that ""one specific history-altering experience: a divine incarnation, a baby crying beneath a pulsing star.""

Steve Douglas, St. Petersburg",05/01/2017
Tampa Bay Times,What to know as Amendment 2 goes into effect today,"TALLAHASSEE — Dr. Joseph Dorn has had a unique vantage point when it comes to the burgeoning medical marijuana industry in Florida.

Dorn was the medical director of Surterra Therapeutics, which is one of the six dispensing organizations licensed to grow and distribute medical cannabis in the state. He resigned from that position two months ago and has opened a medical marijuana treatment center as Amendment 2 takes effect today.

The constitutional amendment, which was approved by 71 percent of Florida voters, allows higher-strength marijuana to be used for a wider list of medical ailments. However, the true measure of what the amendment means won't be immediately seen until a new set of rules are adopted and implemented by the Florida Legislature and the Department of Health.

""I think the expectations for most people is it is going to be a free-for-all, and all people have to do is get their cards to receive it,"" Dorn said. ""I think there is going to be a lot of chaos initially because there is still a lot of work to be done.""

The upcoming year will be important, considering the health and economic factors at play.

A study recently released by Arcview Market Research and New Frontier Data showed that Florida is on track to log more than $1 billion in medical marijuana sales by 2019 and surpass Colorado within four years.

What the amendment does

It allows the use of medical marijuana for people with debilitating medical conditions as determined by a licensed physician. In 2014, the Florida Legislature approved the use of low-THC and non-smoked cannabis for patients suffering from cancer, epilepsy, chronic seizures and chronic muscle spasms. It was expanded last year to include patients with terminal conditions under the Right to Try Act and allowed them to use higher strains.

Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, ALS, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or other similar conditions will now be covered.

How patients can obtain marijuana

Patients must be under the care of a licensed physician who has completed the required eight-hour course and examination for at least three months. Dorn, who is one of three approved physicians in Tallahassee, said he is nearly booked with appointments for the upcoming week.

According to the Department of Health, 340 physicians are registered. Christian Bax, who runs the Office of Compassionate Use, which is tasked with regulating medical marijuana, said last month he expects for there to be a significant increase in registered physicians during the first quarter of the year.

There are currently 1,495 patients in the state registry but that number will steadily increase.

Distributing organizations

Five of the seven licensed organizations have received authorization to distribute medical marijuana. CHT Medical, which was approved two weeks ago, will begin in-home delivery this month. At least one more additional license will likely be granted after a recent settlement between the Department of Health and two Southwest Florida nurseries.

Once the patient registry reaches 250,000, an additional three licenses will be made available, one of which will be designated for black farmers.

Dispensaries are open in Tallahassee, Clearwater and Tampa but according to the Florida League of Cities, 55 cities statewide have zoning moratoriums in place either banning or restricting dispensaries. Eight additional cities are considering moratoriums.

Most moratoriums are temporary as cities and counties await new regulations from Amendment 2's passage.

Next steps

Five more legislative committee weeks are scheduled before the start of the Florida Legislature on March 7. The Florida Senate's Health Policy committee held a workshop in early December to hear concerns from all parties. The House's Health Policy committee has not met yet.

The amendment allows the Department of Health and Legislature to come up with the regulatory framework.

Those who opposed the amendment are urging lawmakers to uphold the tenants of the amendment, especially when it comes to putting laws in place to ban pot candy.

Tampa Bay Times,Lawmakers messed with Rick Scott's org chart in 2016,"If 2016 is a sign of what's to come, Gov. Rick Scott could be in for a bumpy final two years with the Florida Legislature.

While turnover at top government agencies under Scott is nothing new, what was different in 2016 was how legislators forced Scott to replace leaders of agencies at the core of his legacy.

Scott built his fortunes in health care. He ran for office as the job creation governor. Yet the Legislature held up his appointments to key health care agencies, battled with leaders of his economic development agencies and slashed the budget of his chief job creation agency.

Governors in their final two years typically face being seen as a lame duck by the Legislature. But for Scott, that may have started early with lawmakers wreaked havoc on his organizational chart.

Scott's office downplays the turnover, but the following agencies lost their leaders in part by a nudge from the Legislature.

Special to the Times Jesse Panuccio, former head of Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity

Agency: Department of Economic Opportunity

Who: Jesse Panuccio

When: Jan. 8, 2016

First appointed: 2013

Replaced by: Cissy Proctor

Scott did not appear to want Panuccio to resign from the position, but the Legislature, particularly the Florida Senate forced his hand. Panuccio had constant run-ins with Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, and then Senate Commerce and Tourism chairwoman Nancy Detert, who warned Panuccio was in ""extreme danger"" of not being confirmed. Senators faulted Panuccio for not communicating with them better and repeatedly battled him over public complaints about the state's new unemployment benefits system.

Tampa Bay Times John Armstrong, former Florida surgeon general

Agency: Department of Health/Surgeon General

Who: John Armstrong

When: March 9, 2016

First appointed: 2012

Replaced by: Celeste Philip

In the final days of the spring Legislative session, the Florida Senate refused to bring Armstrong confirmation vote to the floor, ending his tenure as Surgeon General. It was the first time in more than 20 years that a Florida governor did not get his appointment to a key agency confirmed by the Senate. Lawmakers' resistance to confirm him grew after the Times/Herald in January highlighted a dramatic rise in HIV rates since Armstrong took office. In the span, county health clinics run by Armstrong's Department of Health have cut positions and seen fewer patients.

Special to the Times Bill Johnson, former head of Enterprise Florida

Agency: Enterprise Florida

Who: Bill Johnson

When: June 24, 2016

First appointed: 2015

Replaced by: Chris Hart IV

Scott has relied on the quasi-government agency to recruit out of state businesses to Florida to deliver on a campaign pledge to create 700,000 jobs in seven years. But a new patch of Florida House leaders have made clear they are philosophically opposed to government handing out tax dollars to private businesses who promise to move jobs to Florida. The result is the that Legislature gave Scott none of the $250 million he asked for to lure businesses to Florida. After the snub by the Legislature, Scott announced Johnson would be leaving the agency just months before an audit of the agency highlighted too much spending on overhead.

Liz Dudek, former head of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration

Agency: Agency for Health Care Administration

Who: Liz Dudek

When: Sept. 21, 2016

First appointed: 2011

Replaced by: Justin Senior

After 40 years in state government and serving as Scott's longest tenured agency head, Dudek announced in September that she was retiring. The Legislature did not force this one directly, but the Senate did initially refuse to confirm her reappointment to the position in 2015. In 2016 they came around and eventually gave her the green light before she announced later in the year she was departing.

Special to the Times Visit Florida CEO Will Seccombe, who has been asked to resign by Gov. Rick Scott after legislative leaders criticized his agency's spending.

Agency: Visit Florida

Who: Will Seccombe

When: TBD

First appointed: 2012

Just a month ago, Scott was standing in Jacksonville praising Visit Florida, another quasi-government agency, for a fourth consecutive year of record tourism. But now Seccombe appears on the way out after Scott called for his resignation just days after the Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran went to court to try to force the disclosure of a secret marketing contract with musician Pitbull. The since disclosed $1 million contract has brought intense criticism. Seccombe has not resigned yet, but goes before the Visit Florida board of directors in early January.",30/12/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"In Tampa Bay area, 2016's memorable stories taxed the nose at times","A look back on Tampa Bay area news from 2016 might carry a warning: Hold your nose. There was mud flinging and sludge slinging, with Gawker on trial over a sex video and St. Petersburg's mayor feeling the stink of trial by sewage. But the news wasn't all bad.

As the year comes to a close, Tampa Bay Times editors chose 10 state and local stories that stood out, presented in no particular order here.

Oops there goes another 10 million gallons

St. Petersburg's overstressed sewer system fouled Tampa Bay waterways in the summer with tens of millions of gallons of partially treated human waste, in a crisis that assaulted the senses and dominated local politics.

The approximately 162 million gallons spilled or dumped cost one high-ranking official his job and triggered state and federal investigations.

Storms in June and September led to smaller spills in Clearwater, Largo, Pinellas County and Tampa, too, but nothing quite like St. Petersburg saw.

Ultimately, Mayor Rick Kriseman pledged more than $300 million in upgrades, dropping his opposition to using BP settlement money to fix sewers.

Still, his year was defined by the spills and his handling of the crisis.

Jury awards Hulk Hogan $140 million, buries Gawker

DIRK SHADD | Times Hulk Hogan leaves the courthouse in St. Petersburg after a jury ruled in his favor against Gawker Media.

The March trial of Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker, staged in Pinellas County, had it all, most notably a celebrity sex scandal.

Retired professional wrestler Terry ""Hulk Hogan"" Bollea sued Gawker Media, alleging the New York company violated his privacy in 2012 by posting online a secretly recorded video of him having sex with the wife of ex-best friend and radio DJ Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.

Gawker suffered a punishing loss: Founder Nick Denton and former editor A.J. Daulerio were ordered to pay Bollea $140.1 million in damages.

The company filed for bankruptcy protection. The flagship site Gawker.com went dark, and Gawker settled with Bollea for a reported $31 million.

Florida decides it's time for medical marijuana

MONICA HERNDON | Times Vials of medical marijuana oil.

In 2016, a state divided over presidential candidates came together over cannabis.

Floridians passed a constitutional amendment that allows patients with conditions like cancer and HIV to use marijuana.

Defeated just two years ago, the 2016 measure passed with the support of 6.5 million Floridians, or nearly 2 million more than those who voted for President-elect Donald Trump.

It's unclear when or how the drug will be made available. The Department of Health will begin writing rules in January. By 2019, Florida could produce $1 billion in sales.

Eyes opened to toll plan for Howard Frankland Bridge

ELI ZHANG | Times

Florida's Department of Transportation tabled a plan to add toll lanes to the Howard Frankland Bridge, after the Times called attention to what the plan actually entailed.

Rebuilding the northbound span had been on the books for years. Elected officials in Pinellas and Hillsborough counties approved a plan promoted by the Florida Department of Transportation that included toll lanes.

DOT said tolls would speed the commute for those willing to pay as much as $6 each way.

While many thought the tolls would mean new lanes for the four-lane bridge, DOT's plan was to put the toll on an existing lane, leaving only three lanes for drivers who didn't want to pay. Local leaders were outraged. After a week of criticism, DOT put the project on hold. Six weeks later, the DOT official who oversaw the project resigned.

Look, up in the air, it's a cigar and a bottle of rum

PAUL GUZZO | Times Passengers were given free hats for the first commercial flight on Southwest Airlines in five decades from Tampa International Airport to Havana on Dec. 12.

Daima Canco flew to Havana on the morning of Dec. 12 to see family. She also saw history. The Cuban-born woman became the first passenger on a commercial flight from Tampa to set foot in Havana in more than 50 years.

Southwest Airlines' daily commercial service from Tampa to Havana came in a wave of increasingly normalized relations between the United States and Cuba. Tampa was chosen by the U.S. Department of Transportation as one of 10 cities to host the commercial service.

With President Barack Obama's Cuba policies facing criticism by a new administration, it's unclear how long the flights will last.

Walmart gives new meaning to blue light specials

LAURA MOREL | Times Zephyrhills police officer Timothy Murr speaks with Walmart's loss prevention employees outside of a store at 7631 Gall Blvd. after someone was accused of trespassing. In 2014, officers were called to the Walmart nearly 1,000 times.

A Times analysis of one year of police work at Walmart revealed more than 16,000 calls to the area's 53 supercenters, often for petty conduct. Critics said the company foisted its security burden onto public agencies.

Elected officials demanded reviews. Walmart executives flew to the Tampa Bay area and met with police chiefs and sheriffs.

A corporate spokeswoman said, simply: ""We know we can do better, and we will.""

Walmart has since expanded a diversion program for some first-time shoplifters at stores across Tampa Bay, among other efforts.

Hermine and Matthew remind Florida how wet feels

DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times Kaleigh Black, 14, left, and Amber Olsen, 12, run for cover as a squall with rain and wind pelt them while they explore the Cocoa Beach Pier on Oct. 7 after Hurricane Mat Matthew rolled along Florida's east coast.

It had been 11 years since a hurricane made landfall on Florida's coast. Experts had warned of ""hurricane amnesia.""

Then Hurricane Hermine remembered the ""forgotten coast,"" striking the Panhandle Sept. 2 with 64 mph winds and causing so much flood damage in Pasco it was deemed one of the most expensive disasters in the county's history.

Two more storms would hit Florida out of the 15 named storms that brewed in the Atlantic: Tropical Storm Colin and Hurricane Matthew. The first Category 5 hurricane out of the Atlantic since 2007, Matthew stayed just off shore as it whipped up Florida's east coast.

Still, experts said the storms inflicted about $1.6 billion worth of damage on the state.

Times buys and closes the Tampa Tribune

CHRIS URSO | Times The empty Tampa Tribune newsroom is seen in May after the newspaper was purchased by the Tampa Bay Times.

In May, the Times bought the struggling Tampa Tribune, taking on its subscribers, advertisers and some of its staff, but halting 121 years of daily publication for a paper with deep ties to the community.

The Tribune had already been spun off by longtime owner Media General to California-based investors who sold its Hillsborough River location to be bulldozed for apartments.

Times chairman and CEO Paul Tash said the purchase would create one financially secure, locally owned newspaper for all of Tampa Bay, noting at the time, ""The continued competition between the newspapers was threatening to both.""

New Catholic bishop named to replace Robert Lynch

DIRK SHADD | Times Retiring Bishop Robert Lynch, left, introduced Gregory L Parkes, the new bishop for the Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg, at a news conference.

Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Nugent Lynch, 75, and the Diocese of St. Petersburg learned the name of his replacement: Bishop Gregory L. Parkes.

Lynch served nearly 21 years as bishop for a diocese of half-million Roman Catholics, spread across the Tampa Bay area.

Parkes, 52, previously led the Pensacola-Tallahassee Diocese. He's a former banker who heard the call to the priesthood as a parishioner at Christ the King Catholic Church in Tampa.

He will be installed during an invitation-only service Wednesday at the Cathedral of St. Jude the Apostle in St. Petersburg.

Ground opens beneath Mosaic gypsum stack in Polk

JIM DAMASKE | Times An aerial view of a massive sinkhole that opened beneath a gypsum stack at a Mosaic phosphate fertilizer plant in Mulberry dumped at least 215 million gallons of contaminated water into the Floridan Aquifer

Officials at the Mosaic phosphate plant near the Hillsborough-Polk County line knew by late August that a massive sinkhole had opened under one of their gypsum stacks, swallowing an estimated 215 million gallons of contaminated water.

But the public didn't learn about the threat to the Floridan Aquifer, the source of much of Florida's drinking water, for almost three weeks.

Mosaic officials said they were required only to report the event to the state Department of Environmental Protection, which also kept quiet about it. And Mosaic provided its neighbors with bottled water and free testing of their well water.

But at least three of the neighbors have filed suit against Mosaic. And Gov. Rick Scott told the DEP to come up with a new rule requiring notification of a pollution incident to the public within 24 hours.",30/12/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Carlton: Judge K, full-time powerhouse on the federal bench at 80","Well, yes, since I asked. The federal judge did love those stiletto heels of hers.

If you saw U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich at the federal courthouse in Tampa over the years, perhaps you noticed them too: those glamorous, teetering Sex and the City shoes below dour judicial robes.

""I can't wear those babies anymore,"" says Judge K, as the lawyers call her. Rather matter-of-factly, she reports that she has lost 6 inches since her 5-foot-8-and-a-half teenage basketball playing days, or when she was photographed meeting Dwight D. Eisenhower in gloves, hat and heels (her in the heels, not him).

But really, little else about Judge K seems to have changed.

This is particularly remarkable in that she turned 80 the other day, a thing you would not have guessed based on the force in her voice or the schedule she still keeps — having recently finished a massive, monthslong murder and drug trafficking trial out of Manatee County that included 147 government witnesses alone.

Some of Judge K's younger colleagues have opted for what's called senior status, which allows federal judges to determine how many cases they take. It also lets the district replace that judge, which means more judges working, a nice perk.

But after 35 years on the bench, Judge K remains a full-load, full-bore judge. (Though for the record, she is not the oldest on the Tampa bench. That would be William Castagna, who is 92 and has the aforementioned senior judge status. True story: He has celebrated recent birthdays by going water-skiing. Maybe it's something in the courthouse water fountains.)

Judge K says when Ronald Reagan nominated her in 1982, she told him she would ""do this to the best of my ability for the rest of my life."" Though perhaps the president didn't take that literally.

No matter. The cases keep coming — tax return fraud, child porn, federal discrimination trials and patent cases. And because courthouses never lose their capacity for variety and the infinite number of ways people manage to get in trouble, how about a pilot who lands a small plane at Tampa International Airport while seriously drunk. Sit on that bench long enough, and you hear just about everything.

She has had some pivotal cases, like when she ruled in the 1980s that fears about AIDS and HIV were not enough to keep three brothers from going to public school in Arcadia. Once, a plane flew over local skies pulling a banner criticizing a Kovachevich decision. Like I said, courthouses are interesting places.

In Washington, she fought for new judgeships, something a lot of people thought just wasn't going to happen.

""You can't tell her she can't do something,"" says fellow federal judge Susan Bucklew. ""Because if you tell her that, she's going to do it.""

""We got four judgeships,"" Judge K reports. ""I was shooting for five.""

And on her 80th, well, she had cases to hear.

""Things happen. I don't wear the heels anymore,"" she says, ""but I keep motoring along.""

Tampa Bay Times,Column: Florida is on the front line of a war on fake medications,"Worldwide, counterfeit drugs kill more than 1 million people each year. The recent conviction of a Palm Harbor oncologist demonstrates that Florida patients are directly at risk.

Unregulated, illegally imported medications have become a big threat to public safety. Over the years, cancer patients have received fake medications containing salt and starch and no active ingredient at all. Counterfeits are reaching hospitalized liver transplant patients, as well as schizophrenia, high cholesterol and impotency patients. Also affected are heart, antibiotic, hair loss and arthritis patients, as well as those suffering from Parkinson's and HIV/AIDS. In one case, a foreign-sourced blood thinner was suspected to have resulted in as many as 81 deaths.

Florida is ripe with illicit activity — with online pharmacies becoming an increasingly common source of counterfeits and illegally imported medications. As consumers flock to the Internet to find savings and discounts, online scammers see a new avenue to push fake and reimported drugs. These online pharmacies are well-represented in Florida and include a good share of fake pharmacies that have also engaged in money laundering.

A White House report noted that Florida has become a hotbed for this activity, stating:

""Diverted pharmaceuticals are supplied in significant quantities to other regions of the United States by doctors, pharmacists and pain management clinics based in Florida using fraudulent methods. South Florida (Drug Enforcement) Task Force operations are successfully targeting these organizations, and long-term undercover operations are beginning to yield significant results with arrests of high-level multiple clinic owners and a large number of corrupt physicians.""

Drugs that are reimported have frequently changed hands up to seven or eight times through countries like China, Vietnam, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon, skirting FDA oversight. Even if the products turn out to be authentic, because there is no FDA oversight, doctors and patients have no way to check if these drugs were handled properly, contaminated during storage or shipped at unsafe temperatures.

In March the FDA sent letters, including 159 to Florida medical offices, notifying them that they purchased illegal Botox from a supplier that later pleaded guilty to smuggling misbranded drugs into the United States. These online pharmacies have websites that appear completely legitimate and they often appear to use U.S. toll-free numbers, although the actual calls may terminate in the Philippines or another foreign country.

If these illegal distributors and counterfeiters are fooling medical offices, fooling patients may not be difficult.

Unlike the sale of inferior quality counterfeit designer handbags, for example, there are real victims here. The distribution and sale of counterfeit and illegally imported medications can have life-threatening consequences for patients. In November 2004, fake and toxic injections passed off as Botox caused paralysis to four patients near Oakland Park in South Florida. Counterfeit versions of the blood-thinning drug heparin were responsible for the deaths of 149 Americans in 2007 and 2008. Recently, federal officials announced they were investigating the deaths of at least 20 individuals suspected of overdosing on black-market oxycodone.

Authorities in Florida need to do more to crack down on illegal distributors and doctors who are operating in clear violation of Florida law. State law prohibits the ""manufacture, repackaging, sale, delivery, or holding or offering for sale of any drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded or has otherwise been rendered unfit for human or animal use.""

As for the next steps, it is important that state officials take action to enforce existing laws and to give law enforcement more resources to fight this war. If necessary, the Legislature needs to strengthen the laws to protect the public interest.

Patients deserve better.

Tampa Bay Times,Sunday's letters: Bill protects prescription coverage,"Bait-and-Switch Bill

Protect prescription coverage

Like more than 90,000 other Floridians, I live with lupus. The disease, which attacks the immune system, can be fatal if not treated correctly, and treating it can be difficult — especially now.

For no medical reason, insurance plans are increasingly making prescription benefit changes to force Floridians off the medications that keep their health stable. These health plans are increasing co-pays to make treatments unaffordable, requiring patients to jump through additional hoops or refusing to cover the medications at all.

Such coverage changes can happen at any time — even in the middle of a plan year when consumers have entered into a contract with their insurer and have no choice but to remain on their current plan.

I'm asking Florida lawmakers to enact the Bait-and-Switch Bill (SB 182/HB 95) and help correct this problem. This new legislation would put protections in place so that commercial insurers cannot lock Floridians into a health plan and then arbitrarily change consumers' pharmacy benefits throughout the plan year.

Prescription coverage changes especially hurt those with chronic health conditions like mine. People living with lupus, epilepsy, mental health conditions, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis — and other chronic or life-threatening conditions — carefully choose health insurance plans that accommodate our medical needs, and any change in our treatment regimen can seriously affect our health.

It sounds simple: Floridians are not able to change their health insurance throughout the year, so health insurers should not be able to change the benefits they provide. Let's enact the Bait-and-Switch Bill to help protect all consumers by ensuring transparency and dependable prescription coverage.

Trump's Cabinet

Senate must check power

President-elect Donald Trump has made some questionable, even alarming, nominations for top posts in his administration. It almost seems like he is bent on disabling the legitimate functions of government, for whatever reasons.

Fortunately, our Constitution and laws provide checks and balances to mitigate such situations. In the case of these nominations, each will have to be considered by the Senate. We must rely on people of good intentions and conscience in the Senate to navigate the potentially devastating effects should some of these nominees take office.

I ask Florida's senators, Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio, to give these nominees a careful and in-depth look. Good judgment and the interests of the people of the United States must prevail over partisan issues and — I hate to suggest this — what looks like the president-elect's efforts at personal enrichment.

Boom with a view | Dec. 18

Urban landscape in peril

A lethal partnership of politics, boosters and developers is combining to create the demise of St. Petersburg. Within 10 years I predict people will avoid downtown because of traffic, long lines at restaurants, crowded parks and entertainment focused only on the wealthy. Within two years some 10,000 new cars will call downtown home, since the only development since the bust has been housing for very rich people.

Early city leaders gave us a great jewel of greenland and park available to everyone. I can ride my bike, sit under a tree and thank god for such beauty and serenity. Tampa is spending millions trying to create the same effect.

Moving from Chicago, I choose the Tampa Bay area and, after a year is South Tampa, moved to St. Petersburg. Traffic in South Tampa began to remind me of Chicago. Urban planners know an ambiance like downtown can't be planned; it happens with the culture. It can, however, be destroyed. Destruction of urban and rural beauty is one of Florida's talents.

Sadly, the process can't be stopped. Buildings are going up and more are planned. We watch as St. Petersburg becomes something we want to avoid.

Another day, another restriction on abortion Dec. 16, commentary

Respect for all life

In Charles Dickens' 1843 classic A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooge, when asked to aid the poor, replies that perhaps their death is a preferable option so as to ""decrease the surplus population."" Sadly, I wonder if there are those today whose mind-set is not unlike that of the infamous Scrooge. Columnist Connie Schultz, explaining her opposition to restrictions on late-term abortions, says of those proposing such legislation: ""They do not worry about bringing into the world children they — and we as communities — cannot afford.""

It is a dangerous thing when communities and nations start down the path of viewing human beings through the lens of affordability. If the unborn is first, then why not the physically and mentally disabled? If the unborn, then why not the elderly and infirm?

As the ghost of Jacob Marley laments over a life of missed opportunities to aid those in need, his former business associate Scrooge attempts to comfort him by reminding him that he was a good man of business. Marley's response rings true as well for us today when it comes to defending the defenseless. ""Mankind was my business.

Tampa Bay Times,"'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' 'E.T.,' 'It Follows' and more coming to Netflix in January","Netflix starts the new year off right with a bounty of new seasons, movies and originals like A Series of Unfortunate Events and a fresh adaptation of the Norman Lear classic, One Day at a Time.

My top picks for what's coming to the streaming service giant in January:

Universal

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jan. 1: Will simultaneously freak you out because aliens and make you cry because adorable alien friendship. The touching story of a young boy who befriends a kind alien and goes above and beyond to keep him safe from prying eyes.

Movies Stills Database

The Shining, Jan. 1: You will have an irrational fear of secluded hotel hallways after this movie. Jack Nicholson plays a writer and devoted father who goes mad after becoming a winter caretaker of the ominous Overlook Hotel. Story by Stephen King, directed by Stanley Kubrick. A chilling classic horror flick.

V for Vendetta, Jan. 1: London post-world war is a police state with a fascist government. Vigilante V uses terrorism to fight the oppressors, and finds an ally when he rescues a woman from the secret police.

Netflix

A Series of Unfortunate Events, season 1, Jan. 13: The 2004 film adaptation of the amazing kid novels from Lemony Snicket was meh. Here's hoping Netflix can give the 13-book series a proper screen debut. The three Baudelaire orphans have terribly sad lives after their parents are killed. Through more than a dozen books they have to outsmart and evil man named Count Olaf, who seeks to kill them and claim their inherited fortune. Come for the literary nostalgia, stay for Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf.

It Follows, Jan. 13: One of the most talked about horror films of 2015 tells the stories of young adults passing along an evil entity through sexual contact. The only way to avoid being killed by the entity is to pass it along to someone else. Many have interpreted the film as symbolic of the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.

Tampa Bay Times,"Henry Heimlich, life-saving maneuver creator, dies at 96","CINCINNATI — The surgeon who created the life-saving Heimlich maneuver for choking victims died early Saturday in Cincinnati. Dr. Henry Heimlich was 96.

His son, Phil, said he died at Christ Hospital after suffering a heart attack earlier in the week.

""My father was a great man who saved many lives,"" said Heimlich, an attorney and former Hamilton County commissioner. ""He will be missed not only by his family but by all of humanity.""

Heimlich was director of surgery at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati in 1974 when he devised the treatment for choking victims that made his name a household word.

Rescuers using the procedure abruptly squeeze a victim's abdomen, pushing in and above the navel with the fist to create a flow of air from the lungs. That flow of air then can push objects out of the windpipe and prevent suffocation.

Much of Heimlich's 2014 autobiography focuses on the maneuver, which involves thrusts to the abdomen that apply upward pressure on the diaphragm to create an air flow that forces food or other objects out of the windpipe.

The Cincinnati chest surgeon told The Associated Press in a February 2014 interview that thousands of deaths reported annually from choking prompted him in 1972 to seek a solution. During the next two years, he led a team of researchers at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. He successfully tested the technique by putting a tube with a balloon at one end down an anesthetized dog's airway until it choked. He then used the maneuver to force the dog to expel the obstruction.

The Wilmington, Delaware, native estimated the maneuver has saved the lives of thousands of choking victims in the United States alone. It earned him several awards and worldwide recognition. His name became a household word.

The maneuver was adopted by public health authorities, airlines and restaurant associations, and Heimlich appeared on shows including the ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" and ""The Today Show.""

His views on how the maneuver should be used and on other innovations he created or proposed put him at odds with some in the health field. He said his memoir was an effort to preserve his technique.

""I know the maneuver saves lives, and I want it to be used and remembered,"" he told the AP. ""I felt I had to have it down in print so the public will have the correct information.""

The maneuver has continued to make headlines. Clint Eastwood was attending a golf event in Monterey, California, in 2014 when the then-83-year-old actor saw the tournament director choking on a piece of cheese and successfully performed the technique.

""The best thing about it is that it allows anyone to save a life,"" Heimlich told the AP.

In 2016, Heimlich himself was the hero, saving a woman choking on food at his senior living center.

Heimlich said the maneuver is very effective when used correctly, but he did not approve of American Red Cross guidelines calling for back blows followed by abdominal thrusts in choking cases that don't involve infants or unconscious victims. Red Cross officials said evidence shows using multiple methods can be more effective, but Heimlich said blows can drive obstructions deeper into a windpipe. The American Heart Association backs abdominal thrusts.

Neither organization supports Heimlich's view that using the maneuver to remove water from the lungs could save drowning victims. They recommend CPR.

Heimlich was proud of some of his other innovations, such as a chest drain valve credited by some with saving soldiers and civilians during the Vietnam War. But he drew sharp criticism for his theory that injecting patients with a curable form of malaria could trigger immunity in patients with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Medical experts have said injecting patients with malaria would be dangerous and have criticized Heimlich for conducting studies involving malariotherapy on HIV patients in China.

Heimlich mostly brushed off critics.

""I'll be the first to admit that a number of my ideas are controversial and in some ways unorthodox,"" Heimlich told the AP. ""But I have enough guts to know that when I am right, it will come about as the thing to do, even if others do the wrong thing for a time.""

One of his most vocal critics has been his son, Peter Heimlich. The younger Heimlich split with his father years ago over a personal rift. He initially circulated anonymous criticisms of his father before openly speaking out against him online and in media interviews.

Peter Heimlich has called many of his father's theories dangerous and spent years challenging many of his claims and trying to discredit them. The elder Heimlich maintained that his relationship with his son was a family matter refused to comment on it to the media.

The elder Heimlich attended Cornell University undergraduate and medical schools and interned at Boston City Hospital. During World War II, the U.S. Navy sent him to northwest China in 1942 to treat Chinese and American forces behind Japanese lines in the Gobi Desert.

Beginning in the 1950s, he held staff surgeon positions at New York's Metropolitan Hospital and Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center. He later was an attending surgeon on the staffs at Jewish and Deaconess hospitals in Cincinnati and a researcher at his nonprofit Heimlich Institute.

Heimlich's wife Jane, daughter of the late dance teacher Arthur Murray, died in November 2012.

He is survived by two sons and two daughters.

Phil Heimlich said a private family service and burial is planned soon. The family hopes to arrange a public memorial, he added, that will give his father's friends and admirers a chance to pay their respects.",18/12/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Medical marijuana in Florida could top $1B in three years,"Florida is on track to log more than $1 billion in medical marijuana sales by 2019, according to an industry report released Tuesday.

The estimates are good news for Florida's budding medical cannabis industry, fresh off a major ballot box win last month.

By 2020, the report predicts, Florida will be the second-largest medical marijuana market in the country, following only California. Marijuana industry analysts New Frontier Data and Arcview Market Research compiled the estimates based on data from governments, businesses and activists.

Floridians approved Amendment 2 with 71 percent of the vote in last month's election. Once it goes into effect, doctors will be able to recommend marijuana as a treatment for cancer, HIV/AIDS and other debilitating conditions.

RELATED: Implementing the medical marijuana vote could be slow in Tallahassee

New Frontier and Arcview assume sales will begin next year. They predict $10 million in marijuana sales in 2017, though the earliest the drug could be available to an expanded group of patients is late in the year.

From there, revenues from the market would only grow, gaining steam from national upward trends in the marijuana industry and the state's steady population growth.

Earlier estimates from the groups' previous reports pegged the Florida market at just slightly below these new measures, though the report's authors say they used new, better data and that old and new projections ""cannot be compared.""

But a word of caution: It's impossible to know just how the rules governing medical marijuana in Florida will look until the state Legislature and Department of Health have their say.

""The full regulatory structure and key program details remain to be determined,"" the report says, ""and the market could take a few different directions depending on the actions of the Florida Legislature and the Florida Department of Health.""",06/12/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Natasha Richards, a fierce fixture of Tampa Bay's drag queen community, dies at 44","On drag show stages across Tampa Bay, Natasha Richards made an unforgettable first impression.

Just ask Darlene Herrick, who remembers the top hat, short tuxedo and fishnets Richards wore while dancing in 4-inch heels to Get the Party Started by Shirley Bassey.

Or ask Gregory Brady, who saw one of her earliest shows when she was 16, lipsynching to Patsy Cline's Crazy. Even as a drag queen novice, her talent was clear, Brady said.

""She already knew how to move and command the stage,"" Brady, 52, said Sunday. ""She was a natural performer.""

Richards, a Clearwater-based performer who won dozens of titles in local and national drag pageants, died Friday. She was 44.

The circumstances and cause of her death were unclear.

Richards, who mentored young drag queens trying to break into the scene, performed at many clubs in the Tampa Bay area, including Flirt Nightclub, a now-closed gay club in Ybor City owned by Herrick, who sought out Richards to perform there.

""Knowing her for years, going to her shows, I thought, 'If this club is going to be successful, I have to have Natasha Richards,' "" Herrick said.

Her performances were theatrical, and her costumes and makeup were impeccable and never repeated, friends said. She choreographed and designed outfits for her own shows and for clients. Her ability to emcee a show with a sharp sense of humor left the audience laughing until their stomachs hurt, Herrick said.

Richards used her commanding presence to raise money for charities. She was the go-to person for gay pride celebrations, said Brady, a business owner in Dunedin who was close friends with Richards for almost 30 years. She was passionate about causes helping those with HIV and AIDS and combating bullying and discrimination.

She was one of the performers who brought Latin Night to the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, where 49 people were killed this year in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

""We must stand strong, stand by our beliefs and show everyone we are here to stay,"" she told the Tampa Bay Times after the shooting.

Richards was born in Queens, N.Y., and moved to New Port Richey during childhood, Brady said. She was born a man and transitioned to a woman soon after she started performing. Her late mother, Noel Hoffman, who was gay, and grandmother, a former dancer on Broadway, embraced Richards' life as a drag queen, Brady said. The acceptance she felt on stage made her realize she was more comfortable living as a woman, he said.

""That was really the cornerstone. She went from being a young gay person that probably was not comfortable in her own skin,"" Brady said. ""It gave her a sense of confidence that she probably had not felt.""

Even offstage, Richards was always putting on a show. Amy DeMilo, a close friend and fellow performer, remembered one night when Richards stayed over at her house. DeMilo walked into her kitchen to find Richards in front of her dogs, performing what was likely a song by Whitney Houston, one of her favorite singers.

Behind her stage persona, she was a fun and loyal friend. She held DeMilo's hand while a veterinarian put down her pitbull, Jack. She pushed a microphone-shy DeMilo into emceeing for the first time.

""She comes across in her drag persona as all about her,"" DeMilo said, ""but she was so much more than that. She really cared about her friends and family.""

As news of her death spread over the weekend, fans shared their favorite videos of Richards' performances. One that popped up repeatedly was a 1995 routine where Richards played Cinderella. She emerged from the center of the stage, glowing in a white tiered gown, to waltz with her prince.

As the clock struck midnight, she shook her thick brown hair out of a bun, shoved the prince out of the way and started dancing to a pop song as backup dancers ripped off her skirt to reveal thigh-high white boots and a leotard with cutouts in a burst of energy that never wavered.

At the end, she took a bow, and the crowd roared.

Tampa Bay Times,"Popular with voters, medical marijuana finds few champions in Tallahassee","TALLAHASSEE — Medical marijuana's implementation is turning out to be a slow burn.

More than 6 million Floridians voted in November to allow patients with conditions like cancer and HIV to use marijuana — nearly 2 million more than President-elect Donald Trump's state total.

But such overwhelming support for the state constitutional amendment has not translated into urgency in the capital.

Setting rules governing a new medical marijuana industry is not a top priority for the newly elected leaders of the Legislature, Senate President Joe Negron and House Speaker Richard Corcoran. Gov. Rick Scott has largely avoided weighing in on the issue.

""All I'd say on that is that we're going to honor the will of the voters, we're going to protect the Constitution, and we're going to protect the people's state of Florida,"" said Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes.

This, at least, is a point of agreement between Corcoran and Negron, whose relationship is already marked by sharp divisions over the state budget and rules for lobbyists.

What that means for state policy, however, is uncertain. Despite the amendment's popularity, neither Corcoran nor Negron mentioned medical marijuana at the ceremonial organizational session late last month until reporters pressed them for details.

Corcoran, who opposed medical marijuana on the ballot, is an outspoken supporter of free-market public policy, particularly in health care, but he has not elaborated on the specifics of how that would play into creating a tightly regulated industry for medical marijuana.

Negron, R-Stuart, remained silent on Amendment 2 through the campaign.

A trusted ally, Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, was an early supporter of medical marijuana and plans to file a medical marijuana bill in the Senate. Brandes' proposal would open the market to competition among a large number of growers and sellers.

Negron echoes Corcoran, saying he wants to implement the amendment ""verbatim"" and that he plans to follow the voters' wishes ""fully both in letter and in spirit.""

No marijuana legislation has been filed yet, but few bills of any kind have. The annual legislative session does not begin until March 7.

Already, moneyed interests are hiring lobbyists to influence the outcome.

Growers licensed under a small medical cannabis program already in state law have registered to lobby the House. They have limited customers under the current program, which allows certain patients, like children with severe epilepsy, to use a strain of marijuana that doesn't cause a euphoric high. It also allows the terminally ill to use full-strength pot.

Other companies that may apply for future licenses to grow have hired advocates, too.

Florida for Care, the group behind Amendment 2, this week hired lobbyists of its own.

""We want to be very reasonable . . . and to do everything in our power to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,"" said Ben Pollara, campaign manager for the group.

Florida for Care argues that voters intended to allow marijuana as treatment for more conditions, including cancer and HIV, and to expand the industry to include more competition from more growers. But the group's No. 1 goal next year will be passing a law that avoids a court battle, Pollara said.

The Florida Department of Health, which is charged with overseeing medical marijuana, plans to begin writing regulations Jan. 3, when Amendment 2 goes into effect. It's the same agency that took more than two years to put into place the limited medical cannabis program passed by lawmakers in 2014.

Health officials have six months from that date to approve rules for the program, but a declaration on its website further complicates matters.

The page says that ""the expanded qualifying medical conditions will become effective on January 3, 2017.""

Asked for details, health department officials have been unclear about what that means.

Yes, the added list of conditions goes into effect next month, spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said. However, she noted, ""the Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations, and patients remain bound by existing law and rule.""

The laws already on the books limit full-strength marijuana to terminally ill patients and don't include the more wide-ranging set of conditions the voters passed.

Tampa Bay Times,Mike Pence and 'conversion therapy': a history,"Since the time that Mike Pence was chosen as Donald Trump's running mate in July, he has faced complaints from groups critical of his record on gay and transgender rights, who said he has long been an opponent of the gains made by the LGBT community in recent years.

Pence has been particularly dogged by accusations that he is a supporter of ""conversion therapy,"" the practice of trying to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. It has been discredited by the medical establishment and denounced by gay and transgender groups.

Pence spokesman Marc Lotter denied to the New York Times over the weekend that the vice president-elect supports the practice, saying a past campaign statement had been misinterpreted. LGBT groups remain skeptical, pointing to his record of opposition to gay rights as a member of Congress and as governor of Indiana and an approving reference to conversion therapy in the 2016 Republican Party platform.

What is conversion therapy?

The phrases ""conversion therapy"" and ""reparative therapy"" refer to discredited psychotherapy methods that aim to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Spiritual efforts to accomplish the same goal are sometimes called ""ex-gay ministry.""

Conversion therapy has been condemned by a range of groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association, which said it was based on the view that homosexuality is a disorder, an idea ""that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions.""

Conversion therapy practitioners ""often frame the inability to change one's sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure,"" the APA said.

In the past, efforts to change someone's sexual orientation sometimes involved extreme measures like institutionalization, castration and electroshock therapy, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

Pence's connection

A statement on an archived version of the website for Pence's 2000 congressional campaign has been widely interpreted as signaling his support for conversion therapy. After listing his opposition to same-sex marriage and anti-discrimination laws that protect gay people, Pence's website takes up the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for HIV/AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year:

""Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.""

Pence had not addressed speculation about his support for conversion therapy until last weekend, when Lotter told the Times it was ""patently false"" that Pence ""supported or advocated"" the practice.

Lotter said the vice president-elect had been calling for federal funds to ""be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices"" during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a ""mischaracterization"" to see the statement as a reference to conversion therapy. But he declined to explain which organizations Pence had wanted to lose their federal funding or what Pence meant when he referred to groups that ""celebrate and encourage"" activity that spreads HIV. Gay and transgender groups see that as a reference to their community.

""That is very specific language — some might call it a dog whistle — that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs,"" Carey said. ""Particularly the phrase 'seeking to change their sexual behavior,' to me, is code for conversion therapy.""

GOP support

Conversion therapy was tacitly endorsed in the Republican Party platform for the first time this year in a line that supported the ""right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children.""

Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican Party and the incoming White House chief of staff, told reporters that the language did not refer to conversion therapy, but gay and transgender groups did not believe him.

A coalition of former leaders of the ex-gay movement wrote an open letter in July denouncing the platform as ""essentially affirming"" conversion therapy. They said they could ""attest to the emotional and spiritual damage caused to men, women, children and their families"" by the practice.

The Republican position differs sharply from the Democrats'. President Barack Obama called for an end of conversion therapy for minors in 2015 after a 17-year-old transgender girl, Leelah Alcorn, killed herself after leaving a suicide note that talked about her time in conversion therapy.

Tampa Bay Times,Zephyrhills enacts moratorium on marijuana dispensaries,"ZEPHYRHILLS — City leaders have passed a temporary ban on marijuana dispensaries in the wake of voter approval of a state constitutional amendment legalizing medical pot.

During a meeting Monday night, the Zephyrhills City Council voted unanimously to approve an ordinance that puts in place a moratorium on the establishment of marijuana dispensaries in the city for a year. The ordinance cites a lack of land-use regulations on the books. While the council approved the one-year time period, it has the option to repeal the moratorium sooner.

The council's vote is a result of a request by City Attorney Matthew Maggard to investigate the impact of the constitutional amendment, which passed Nov. 8, allowing doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to patients with debilitating diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and epilepsy. The amendment passed on the heels of the 2014 Compassionate Use Act, which allowed for the prescribing of low-THC marijuana for patients.

The ordinance describes the uncertainty facing the city regarding medical marijuana, as well as the need to investigate possible ways to regulate dispensaries.

""Florida laws relating to the cultivation, production and dispensing of cannabis products are rapidly changing — raising the substantial question about whether cannabis-related land uses, as a category of commercial use, may have deleterious and negative secondary impact on surrounding land uses and communities,"" the ordinance states.",29/11/2016

Tampa Bay Times,"'Hamilton' member gives Pence earful; Trump: ""Apologize!""","NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded an apology from the ""Hamilton"" cast member who gave Mike Pence an onstage earful about equality.

Actor Brandon Victor Dixon told the Republican vice president-elect after the curtain call Friday night that the Broadway hit's multiracial and multicultural cast is concerned about the Trump administration.

""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,"" said Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president. ""We truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.""

Pence ducked out before Dixon finished the unprecedented message but heard the full remarks from the hallway outside the auditorium.

""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing,"" the Republican Trump tweeted Saturday. ""The theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!""

Dixon tweeted at Trump saying ""conversation is not harassment sir"" while adding that he appreciates Pence stopping to listen.

The atmosphere was tense from the time Pence arrived at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, triggering both cheers and boos as he slipped into the prime orchestra seats. After the curtain-call, Dixon called Pence out from the stage, with the cast behind him.

""Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us, just a few more moments. There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen,"" Dixon said. ""We're all here sharing a story about love.""

Outside, many protesters jeered, including one woman who held up a sign with a line from the musical that always gets a cheer: ""Immigrants, we get the job done."" Dixon's speech, which ended with a plea to donate to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, brought down the house.

""Hamilton,"" which won 11 Tony Awards, has been praised by politicians and rap stars alike, influenced the debate over the nation's currency and burst through the Broadway bubble like none other.

The first family has been big boosters of the show. President Barack Obama took daughters Sasha and Malia to see it last year after first lady Michelle Obama caught it last spring. Vice President Joe Biden also has seen it.

The show is by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical's book, music and lyrics. It stresses the orphan, immigrant roots of Alexander Hamilton and has a terrifically varied score, ranging from pop ballads to gospel to sexy R&B. It has been cheered for reclaiming the nation's founding story by a multicultural cast.

The Alexander Hamilton that Pence saw was Javier Munoz, an openly gay actor. Pence supported numerous efforts to ban gay marriage as governor of Indiana and opposed unfettered federal funding for HIV and AIDS treatment.

After Pence left, Jeffrey Seller, the show's lead producer, said he hopes the politician would share the show's message of empathy: ""I hope that maybe it inspires him to feel for those not like him.""

Seller, a Tony Award winner who has produced such shows as ""Rent"" and ""Avenue Q,"" said such notable Republicans as former Vice President Dick Cheney and presidential speechwriter Peggy Noonan have come to ""Hamilton.""

""This show is absolutely for Republicans as well as Democrats, and we would like to host any Republican who would like to see the show,"" he said.",19/11/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Even after Tuesday, uncertainty clouds medical marijuana in Florida","TALLAHASSEE — Even though Floridians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to allow medical marijuana, patients are months away from being able to purchase the drug.

Before growers can put plants in the ground or dispensaries can open their doors, state health regulators face a July deadline of writing rules to govern an expanded medical marijuana program. And this spring, the Florida Legislature will undoubtedly consider a cannabis bill as well.

Complicating matters is an existing law that lets a limited number of patients use strains of marijuana low in THC — which causes a euphoric high — and the terminally ill use full-strength cannabis. Six nurseries are already growing, processing and dispensing cannabis under the existing program.

Amendment 2 is broader, allowing doctors to recommend full-strength marijuana as a treatment for a long list of conditions, including glaucoma, HIV/AIDS and cancer. It authorizes the Florida Department of Health to license growers, labs for extracting chemical components from the marijuana and dispensaries to sell the drug.

""It's like raising the speed limit from 5 miles per hour to 65 miles per hour,"" said John Morgan, the chairman and primary donor to the political committee that pushed Amendment 2, United for Care. ""It's going to be that dramatic.""

Lawmakers have three options for what to do next:

• Create a new set of laws for a larger medical marijuana program with a number of licenses available for growers, dispensaries and others in the industry.

• Do little or no expansion of the existing program, allowing the six nurseries with marijuana licenses to maintain control of the market.

• Do nothing and allow two separate cannabis programs.

Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, who has advocated for medical marijuana in the Legislature for three years, said he is already working on a bill to regulate marijuana. He believes it will be the only major bill on the subject in the Senate.

In its current form, the bill would end the existing program, he said, noting it doesn't make sense to have two sets of rules. What's more, he wants to allow more people to grow, process and sell cannabis.

""I am not willing to compromise about opening up the market, period, full stop,"" Brandes said. ""We are going to have a free market system here in Florida.""

The Department of Health has not started to act on new regulations.

""The department will follow the will of the voters,"" spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said Thursday. ""The constitutional amendment goes into effect on Jan. 3, 2017. Until then, current law stands.""

In a document outlining its intent, United for Care wrote last month that it wants to avoid ""arbitrary or overly restrictive limits"" on nurseries or dispensaries, which they say ought to be licensed separately.

That sentiment could be challenged by state lawmakers, who this past spring voted down proposals to have more growers in the state.

What's more, prominent legislators are likely to support tough regulations on medical marijuana, including House Speaker-designate Richard Corcoran, R-Land O' Lakes, and incoming Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater. Both opposed Amendment 2.

The nurseries that have cannabis licenses, as well as businesses that hope to gain a foothold in the state, are lining up big-dollar lobbyists to advocate for them in Tallahassee.

But Brandes warns that attempts to derail a medical marijuana bill would end badly.

Amendment 2 essentially goes into effect even if the state does nothing to create regulations. That would set in motion a court battle.

""That would be the absolute worst-case scenario for everybody, but especially the patients,"" Brandes said.

After it was clear the amendment would pass Tuesday, the No on 2 campaign urged the Legislature to pass additional restrictions banning candy-like products, limiting THC levels and ""tightly"" regulating the medical conditions eligible for cannabis.

Already, local governments have started to act in response to the amendment's passage. Miami Beach on Wednesday passed a four-month moratorium on dispensaries.

Lawyer Jonathan Robbins, who leads the regulated substances task force at the Akerman law firm, says very few things are clear about how Florida's medical marijuana drama will play out.

Just one thing is certain, said Robbins: Unless you have permission under the existing cannabis program, no, you cannot start using medical marijuana yet. And it could be a while before patients have broader access.

""It's certainly fair to say the Legislature's been slow to act, the DOH has had some trouble rolling out the 2014 (low-THC cannabis) program,"" Robbins said. ""I don't know why this would be any different.""

Tampa Bay Times,Florida overwhelmingly votes to legalize medical marijuana,"Patients suffering from debilitating illnesses will soon have access to medical marijuana in Florida after voters approved Amendment 2 Tuesday.

By 8:30 p.m. it was clear that Amendment 2 would pass with well above the required 60 percent threshold. The amendment inserts language into the Florida Constitution allowing those with cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and a host of other conditions to use marijuana if it is recommended by their doctor.

""Getting over 60 percent at this point means so much both symbolically and legally because we're able to relinquish the name of criminals that has been forced on us,"" said Moriah Barnhart of Brandon, whose daughter Dahlia uses cannabis as treatment for brain cancer after being diagnosed at age 2.

Just two years ago, a similar provision fell short. That makes this victory particularly sweet for John Morgan, the Orlando trial lawyer who bankrolled the marijuana campaign's effort to secure a spot on the ballot this year.

""Hundreds of thousands of sick and suffering Floridians will now benefit from this law, and soon,"" Morgan wrote in an email to supporters. ""This was never about winning an election, although that's exactly what we did tonight. The election was a means to an end.""

At a victory party in Orlando, campaign manager Ben Pollara declared that Tuesday's result is the largest pro-marijuana vote in the country.

Florida becomes the 26th state to legalize marijuana for either medical or recreational use. Arkansas and North Dakota voters are considering similar ballot issues this year as well.

In addition to the medical marijuana measure, Floridians approved two property tax-related amendments to the state Constitution. Amendment 3 creates a tax exemption for firefighters, law enforcement and correctional officers disabled after being injured in the line of duty. Amendment 5 allows cities and counties to extend a tax exemption for low-income seniors if the value of their home grows beyond the $250,000 cap already on the books.

Questions remain about how the medical marijuana amendment will be implemented.

The Florida Department of Health has until July 2017 to pass regulations under the new amendment. By October, the state must start registering growers, dispensaries and other facilities and start issuing identification cards for patients approved to use marijuana.

In recent weeks, polls suggested that Amendment 2 would likely pass with wide support. Still, a group of medical marijuana opponents funded by St. Petersburg developer and Republican fundraiser Mel Sembler and Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson mounted an aggressive campaign against it.

The No on 2 campaign argued that passing Amendment 2 would lead to thousands of unsafe pot shops cropping up in the state, the introduction of cannabis candy marketed for children and an unregulated drug industry. However, Amendment 2 allows the Legislature and the health department to closely regulate medical marijuana.

In a statement, No on 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson urged state lawmakers to pass regulations on the medical marijuana industry.

""The authors of Amendment 2 have long maintained that the Legislature has wide discretion to regulate the implementation of Amendment 2 for the health, safety and welfare of all Floridians,"" Johnson said. ""Therefore, we implore the Legislature to take the authors of Amendment 2 at their word by passing implementing legislation that bans pot candy, puts a limit on THC levels, tightly defines 'other debilitating medical conditions,' and gives local communities the right to limit, restrict, and outright ban pot shops.""

Others, including Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, raised objections that medical marijuana should not be legalized by constitutional amendment and instead should be left up the Legislature. Latvala, who had no re-election opponent, funded an anti-marijuana advertising campaign using his own campaign funds.

But patients and their families who have been waiting for access to cannabis say state lawmakers had their chance to act.

Barnhart said she doesn't believe much has changed in the last two years — except that more people have heard stories of patients and their families.

""For people who don't have experience with this, and who are voting entirely based on the information and stories they receive from us and patients and families throughout the state, we're extremely grateful for that faith,"" she said.

Tampa Bay Times,Map: Here's where Floridians voted 'yes' on medical marijuana in 2014,"In one week, voting ends — and Florida could become the latest state to legalize medical marijuana.

Called Amendment 2 on ballots, an initiative seeks to let doctors recommend marijuana for patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and other debilitating conditions.

This is the second time in as many years that Floridians have voted on medical marijuana.

Recent polls suggest about 70 percent of likely voters support Amendment 2. But back in 2014, a similar amendment on the ballot failed with 57.6 percent of the vote — shy of the 60 percent required to pass.

It’s enlightening to look at a map of what parts of the state were strongholds for Amendment 2 in 2014.

Geographic and demographic trends emerge pretty quickly: The state’s largest urban counties tended to favor Amendment 2, as did Leon and Alachua counties, home of college towns Tallahassee and Gainesville. As well, notice a big block of ""yes"" votes in South Florida.

Opposition is shored up in rural areas of Central and North Florida. Traditionally conservative suburban areas in Collier and Nassau counties generally opposed Amendment 2 as well.

But note that even many counties where a majority of voters supported Amendment 2 — like Miami-Dade or Hillsborough — didn’t push past the 60-percent mark.

The most supportive counties: Monroe (71.8%), Broward (67.9%) and Leon (67.8%). And Amendment 2’s biggest opponents: Hardee (39.7%), Holmes (41.1%) and Sumter (42.3%).

Tampa Bay Times,Column: Will medical marijuana provide hope for older adults?,"Older adults tend to suffer from a number of ailments for which medical marijuana could provide some relief, with fewer side effects than existing treatments. Despite its potential medicinal use, medical marijuana is currently illegal at the federal level and illegal or severely restricted in many states, including Florida, a state with the highest proportion in the country of those who are 65 or older.

Medical marijuana may help to alleviate symptoms associated with many chronic conditions through the body's own endocannabinoid system. The body produces endocannabinoids and uses them to regulate organs, glands, the nervous system, connective tissues and the immune system. Cannabinoids found in medical marijuana can perform similar functions because they imitate the endocannabinoids that are naturally produced in our bodies. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example, affect the nervous system, which cannabinoids could help stabilize. Pain and arthritis symptoms could be alleviated by cannabinoids blocking pain-producing inflammation. Medical marijuana reduces nausea and increases appetite — alleviating common cancer treatment side effects.

Medical marijuana could provide relief for these conditions with few side effects compared to medicines currently used. The side effects of medical marijuana include dizziness, impaired driving ability, and the possibility of negative drug interactions. Prescription opioids, on the other hand, tend to generate more side effects, including: impaired driving ability, dizziness, constipation, tolerance and physical dependence, sedation and overdose sometimes leading to death. There have been no documented overdose deaths attributed to marijuana. In 2010, however, prescription opioids were responsible for almost 50 percent of all deaths due to drug overdoses in the United States.

Older adults are also more susceptible to the negative side effects of prescription drugs, and many have multiple prescriptions. In states where medical marijuana was legal, physicians gave out 4,593 fewer prescriptions for all conditions (anxiety, depression, nausea, pain, psychosis, seizures, sleep disorders, spasticity), and 1,826 fewer specifically for pain medications annually per physician. Other findings show that the cost savings for Medicare Part D had risen to $165.2 million by 2013. Overall, if all states had implemented medical marijuana laws, the total savings to Medicare Part D would have been $468.1 million.

Fear certainly contributes to the misgivings surrounding medical marijuana. Studies have shown, however, few negative impacts in states that allow use. Studies in Colorado and Washington have shown that since medical marijuana was legalized, teen rates of use have been unchanged. In Colorado, there has been a slight increase in ER visits of children under 9 from accidental ingestion, but ERs and poison control centers are far more likely to see children who have ingested other substances like laundry detergent or crayons. Traffic fatalities have also remained largely unchanged since medical marijuana was legalized. The potential for abuse of the drug can be curbed by frequent monitoring and evaluation of the patient by a medical doctor.

In November, Florida voters will decide Amendment 2 — which would allow for the use of medical marijuana for debilitating medical conditions. Amendment 2 would broaden Florida's 2014 medical marijuana bill, which already allows low-THC, high-CBD medical marijuana prescriptions for children with epilepsy or other debilitating conditions. Amendment 2 would also allow use by adults who are eligible as determined by a licensed Florida physician as having one of the following debilitating conditions: cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, post-traumatic stress disorder, ALS, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other debilitating medical conditions as determined by a physician. Physicians must perform a physical examination and full medical assessment of the patient and verify that the use of medical marijuana would outweigh the risks and determine the length of use.

Contrary to the claims of the ""No on 2"" campaign, the amendment language clearly states that it will not allow for violation of any law, affect or repeal laws that relate to non-medical use, allow use by anyone other than qualified patients, permit operation of any vehicle while under the influence, shall not require correctional, education, or workplace facilities to accommodate use, nor require medical insurance providers to pay for medical marijuana.

Voters in Florida have an opportunity to vote yes on Amendment 2 and offer millions of Floridians living with chronic debilitating conditions a safer way to manage the pain that mars the lives of many of them.

Tampa Bay Times,Parents: Educate yourselves on circumcision,"A 2016 study published in Population Health Metrics estimates that roughly 39 percent of men worldwide are circumcised. Male circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the penis. The highest rates of circumcision are in the Middle East, parts of Africa, the United States and Canada. In Europe, Latin America and southern Asia, circumcision is relatively rare. A study published online in Mayo Clinic Proceedings reported that the circumcision rate in the United States declined from 83 percent in the 1960s to 77 percent in 2010. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overall rate of circumcision among U.S. males age 14 to 59 is 81 percent. If parents decide to have their baby circumcised in the hospital, their pediatrician, family doctor or obstetrician will perform the procedure before they bring the baby home.

The World Health Organization recommends circumcision as a means of reducing global rates of HIV. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued this Circumcision Policy Statement in 2012: ""Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn circumcision outweigh the risks and that the procedure's benefits justify access to this procedure for families who choose it. Specific benefits identified included prevention of urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, including HIV."" The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support this statement. Also in 2012, the American Urological Association issued this statement: ""The AUA believes that neonatal circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages and risks. … When circumcision is being discussed with parents and informed consent obtained, medical benefits and risks, and ethnic, cultural, religious and individual preferences should be considered. The risk and disadvantages of circumcision are encountered early whereas the advantages and benefits are prospective.""

Despite these policy statements, circumcision remains controversial. In 1996, the Canadian Pediatric Society said this about routine neonatal circumcision: ""The overall evidence of the benefits and harms of circumcision is so evenly balanced that it does not support recommending circumcision as a routine practice for newborns."" There can be complications resulting from the procedure, such as inadequate skin removal, infection, urethral complications, glans injury, removal of too much skin and cyst formation.

The foreskin lubricates and protects the part of the penis known as the glans penis. It has two layers: an outer layer and an inner layer. The inner layer has thousands of nerve endings and is very sensitive to touch, similar to your lips and fingertips. A study published in the Journal of Urology found that men who were circumcised later in life reported decreased penile sensitivity after the procedure.

Some men who have been circumcised experience negative psychological effects, including feeling as if they are not whole because their foreskin has been removed. There are support groups for men who believe they have been psychologically impacted by their circumcision, such as the National Organization for Restoring Men. Many men in these groups think circumcision is a human rights violation and that male infants should be protected from the procedure.

In November 2011, San Francisco attempted to pass a ban on circumcision. The ban would have made it illegal to ""circumcise, excise, cut or mutilate the whole or any part of the foreskin, testicles or penis of another person who has not attained the age of 18 years."" A person performing a circumcision would have faced a misdemeanor charge and a fine of up to $1,000 or a maximum of one year in prison. The measure was removed from the 2011 ballot because it would have violated California's law, which states that medical procedures are regulated by the state, not individual cities. There has been a call to ban circumcisions for nonmedical reasons for boys under the age of 12 in Denmark and Sweden, and many other countries are questioning whether circumcisions for nonmedical purposes should remain legal.

In the United States, parents generally do not have much information on circumcision before deciding whether the procedure should be performed on their sons. Many parents choose circumcision so their son looks like his father. Others opt to circumcise to adhere to cultural or religious norms. Many believe circumcision is necessary for hygienic reasons. It is important to note that proper hygiene could protect men from contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted infections in countries where soap and running water are readily accessible. Regardless of the reason, it is important that parents educate themselves on the pros and cons of circumcision before choosing it for their son. Parents should speak with their OB/GYN or family physician before consenting to a circumcision.

Tampa Bay Times,HIV arrived in the U.S. long before 'Patient Zero',"In the tortuous mythology of the AIDS epidemic, one legend never seems to die: Patient Zero, aka Gaétan Dugas, a globe-trotting, sexually insatiable French Canadian flight attendant who supposedly picked up HIV in Haiti or Africa and spread it to dozens, even hundreds, of other men before his death in 1984.

But after a new genetic analysis of stored blood samples, bolstered by some intriguing historical detective work, scientists on Wednesday declared him innocent.

The strain of HIV responsible for almost all AIDS cases in the United States, which was carried from Zaire to Haiti around 1967, spread from there to New York City around 1971, researchers concluded in the journal Nature. From New York, it spread to San Francisco around 1976.

The new analysis shows that Dugas' own blood, sampled in 1983, contained a viral strain already infecting men in New York before he began visiting gay bars here after being hired by Air Canada in 1974.

Myths like that of Patient Zero echo in prevention efforts even today, experts said. Many vulnerable groups, including young gay men and African women, fail to use protective drugs or avoid testing because they fear being stigmatized or accused of being carriers.

Reflecting on the epidemic's early days, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, then a doctor treating AIDS patients and now the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he remembered it seeming plausible at the time that one person was responsible.

In hindsight, he added, the idea now seems absurd. ""We were unaware of how widespread it was in Africa,"" Fauci said.

The new data are consistent with the scenario described in 2011 in The Origins of AIDS, by Dr. Jacques Pépin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec. Relying on previous genetic research and African colonial records, Pépin showed that HIV was carried from Kinshasa to Haiti in the 1960s.

The blood samples analyzed in the new study were collected in 1978 and 1979 in New York and San Francisco as part of an effort to make a hepatitis B vaccine.",27/10/2016
Tampa Bay Times,People in Miami's latest Zika 'hot zone' want more buzz,"MIAMI — Mosquitoes bite everyone, not just Haitians. It's a point health educator Marie-Jose Ledan is sure to make when she approaches Little Haiti's churches, laundromats and mom-and-pop businesses about protecting people from the Zika virus.

That seems obvious, but many in Miami's newest Zika ""hot zone"" bitterly remember what happened the last time health officials linked a devastating virus to this community: Discrimination and recrimination against Haitians continued for years after the federal government wrongly listed being Haitian as a risk factor for HIV and AIDS.

""That's why we have to be careful so our sisters and brothers do not think they are targeted, just like with the AIDS virus,"" said Ledan, who has been distributing educational materials about Zika in Little Haiti over the last two months.

Authorities in Florida went into damage-control mode when Zika-carrying mosquitoes began biting in the Miami area this summer. Many feared the economy would suffer as pregnant women were warned to avoid the Wynwood art district and touristy South Beach.

With those areas cleared, some fear this third ""hot zone"" is getting less attention. It straddles the city's poorest communities, heavily black Little Haiti and Liberty City. Here, Zika joins a long list of concerns among people who already feel neglected and tend to mistrust authorities. Advocates say containing its spread here will take finesse.

Most of the same aggressive tactics deployed against mosquitoes in the other two areas are being used here as well: Inspectors are making thousands of house calls, trucks are spraying pesticides before dawn and tropical plants that trap water where mosquitoes breed will be pulled from city-owned spaces.

But there are no plans yet for the aerial spraying done in the other two neighborhoods. The county's mayor said last week that it isn't necessary, because the number of Zika-carrying mosquitoes caught in traps hasn't been alarmingly high. Still, people in these neighborhoods suspect they're being shortchanged, and organizers are concerned that poor women won't get the help they need.

Activists also felt slighted when the governor and county mayor called this zone ""the Little River area,"" using a historical name for an overlapping neighborhood, despite the city commission's May resolution recognizing that the name of Little Haiti is as culturally important to Miami as the more widely known Little Havana.

""We have to be very careful in talking, to send the right message,"" Ledan said.

Florida health officials linked an eighth Zika infection on Wednesday to this latest ""hot zone."" It's not known whether any of these people are pregnant, but high-risk pregnancies and infant mortality rates are already higher in the area, even without the threat of Zika-related birth defects, according to Manuel Fermin, CEO of the Healthy Start Coalition of Miami-Dade.

""Now we're adding another major problem,"" he said.

This latest square-mile transmission zone was identified this month, but the coalition was already worried about it months ago. It's just three miles from Wynwood, where Florida's first Zika infections from local mosquito bites were verified. And few of its residents were among the mostly affluent women who were initially getting tested after Florida made Zika-testing free for all pregnant women statewide.

Case managers suspected important information hadn't reached families in Liberty City and Little Haiti, where barriers to prenatal care include not just the cost of services, but also a lack of transportation to appointments, child care or paid time off from work.

""Are we getting the people we need to be getting?"" Fermin said. ""The majority of the women who came in were from a higher socio-economic area, and more were tourists who had been in that area.""

Leroy Jones said he feels his community has been left on its own to deal with Zika. He appreciated that U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat whose district includes both Liberty City and Little Haiti, helped distribute mosquito repellent and information about Zika prevention to local businesses.

But Jones said he's disappointed that the groups who protested against aerial pesticide spraying over South Beach had not come to see what kind of help his community needed.

""Like most things in this country, the rich get taken care of immediately and poor people is always forgot,"" said Jones, who leads an organization that supports inner-city businesses. ""It's sad to say, but I'm speaking from my heart.""

Gov. Rick Scott did meet Friday with local officials at a Catholic school. This zone is primarily residential, unlike the other two, but Scott said he's as committed to stopping Zika's spread there as he has been in tourist destinations.

The students told the governor what they had been instructed to tell their parents: Wear repellent outside, and drain the standing water mosquitoes need to breed.

Spreading the word through students this way is the kind of outreach community advocates say works best in neighborhoods where people rely on word of mouth for information and may be suspicious of government officials knocking on doors.

""They're afraid to open the door because it might be immigration,"" said Ledan, who is working with Planned Parenthood to canvass the neighborhood.

At the Liberty City beauty supply store where Jasmin Qureshi's husband works, more and more women talk about wearing long sleeves to prevent mosquito bites. But in Miami's long hot season, hardly any customers actually cover up, Qureshi said.

She was grateful for the box of mosquito repellent wipes that her congresswoman hand-delivered to the store last week, but said she would feel better if they got the same aerial spraying and attention that Wynwood and South Beach got.

""It would be better if they do more stuff with the plane and everything. We need more protection — as much protection as possible — to get it out of our area,"" Qureshi said.",27/10/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Marijuana amendment faces biggest foe in GOP heavyweight, anti-drug crusader","TALLAHASSEE — To friends and political allies, Mel Sembler is a real estate developer with integrity.

A former ambassador and shopping center magnate, he remains a giant of Tampa Bay politics. His influence stretches from his $3.4 million St. Petersburg penthouse to a network of insiders cultivated from the last three Republican presidencies.

To others, Sembler is known as the founder of Straight Inc., a controversial drug treatment program that operated from 1976 to 1993. He and his wife, Betty, started the residential program to help troubled teens. Yet after opening in about a dozen states, it was shut down amid allegations of abuse and excessive force. Some subjected to the program's get-tough therapy now say years were stolen from their lives.

Now 86, Sembler is using his clout as one of the most powerful figures in Florida politics and the anti-drug movement to defeat a constitutional amendment aimed at expanding medical marijuana in Florida. If passed by 60 percent of voters, Amendment 2 would let doctors recommend marijuana to patients with conditions like cancer, epilepsy and HIV/AIDS.

Sembler has so far donated $1 million to defeat the constitutional amendment. A former national Republican finance chairman, he's tapped his cadre of wealthy donors, too. He says he'll raise $10 million for Drug Free Florida, the political committee opposing the ballot measure.

But as Sembler leads the fight, the controversy surrounding Straight continues to haunt his anti-drug legacy.

""This was the first and only controversy I've ever known having to do with Mel Sembler, and it's regrettable,"" said Pat Neal, a Sarasota home builder and former state senator, who gave $10,000 to the Drug Free Florida effort. ""He only wanted to do the right thing.""

• • •

For a man with such an outsized role in shaping a public policy like medical marijuana, Sembler doesn't reveal much.

He declined a Times/Herald interview and does not publicly talk about why he got involved in the anti-drug movement.

News reports from 20 years ago say his interest started in the 1970s, when he and Betty, parents of three sons, learned that one them was smoking marijuana.

The couple started Straight, which was modeled after a previous anti-drug program called The Seed. Its ambitious goal: end teenage drug use.

""I knew young people who really got straightened out at Straight,"" Neal said. ""It was very controversial, but it was also very effective.""

The idea caught fire, gaining traction in the upper reaches of President Ronald Reagan's administration.

Sembler was one of the people who suggested that first lady Nancy Reagan lead the anti-drug movement, said Maia Szalavitz, author of a 2006 book on the troubled-teen industry, Help at Any Cost.

The White House entrée led to the Bush family. George H.W. Bush later named Sembler ambassador to Australia and Nauru.

""He is someone that local elected officials go to for advice, but he is approachable by heads of state as well,"" said state Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, the first state senator to endorse Amendment 2. ""He's a legendary figure.""

• • •

Marcus Chatfield never met Mel Sembler.

But he was forever changed by him.

As a teen, Chatfield had shoplifted, run away from home and smoked pot a few times. He was never addicted to drugs, he says.

But he told people he was addicted in hopes of avoiding juvenile detention. Instead, Chatfield was sent to Straight's Springfield, Va., facility, where he spent more than a year, most of it on a judge's order.

He spent hours of every day in what Straight called ""raps"" — group meetings where other teens were expected and sometimes bullied into confessing harrowing stories about drugs and alcohol use. Chatfield said they were encouraged to yell at and shame one other.

Many participants had only a few stories to share, but they were under constant pressure, Chatfield said. So he started to lie.

""And after some time, I started to believe it,"" he said.

He said some of the worst abuses were at the hands of other students. After Chatfield had been in the program for several months, he was allowed to start going to school and was placed in charge of other children. He said he followed orders and deprived children of sleep. Sometimes, he said, he and others were told to pin someone on the ground for an entire rap session for acting out.

""That stuff haunts me,"" he said. ""That stuff will always haunt me.""

Now 47, Chatfield lives in Micanopy, where he's a family, youth and community sciences graduate student at the University of Florida. He wants to conduct research into the lasting effects of Straight-style treatment programs.

Straight ultimately came under fire for holding people against their will. Court rulings led to policy changes, and ultimately Straight shut down.

Friends give little credence to claims of abuse and say the Semblers were not aware.

""I know Mel and Betty. I know where there heart was,"" said Susan Latvala, a former Pinellas County commissioner. ""I think it's inappropriate to keep dragging that up.""

A 1993 Florida Inspector General audit suggested Sembler was aware. The report said that despite ""a propensity for abuse or excessive force,"" Straight kept getting licensed.

""It appears that pressure may have been generated by Ambassador Sembler and other state senators,"" the report stated.

A year later, Straight had dissolved.

• • •

To Mel Sembler, fighting medical marijuana is a continuation of his and Betty's life's work.

""We're trying to save lives and people's brains,"" he told the Times/Herald in April. ""It's not a medicine.""

In 1995, Straight's name was legally changed to Drug Free America Foundation, state documents show. The organization no longer provides treatment.

Its work continues in financing campaigns opposing marijuana, both recreational and medical use, which many opponents say could lead to full legalization. Latvala and Neal have served on its board of directors.

With marijuana on ballots across the country, the group is considering more public awareness campaigns, Latvala said.

Yet given Straight's history, Szalavitz was dismayed that the Semblers were shaping public drug policy. After spending five years researching adolescent centers for her book, she confirmed numerous allegations of abuse at Straight.

""They should have no sway over drug policy in any way,"" she said.

Tampa Bay Times,Email about Qatari offer shows thorny ethical issues Clinton foundation faced,"In April 2012, representatives from Qatar were apparently hoping to get ""five minutes"" with former President Bill Clinton while in New York to present him with a $1 million check for his foundation as a birthday gift from the previous year.

While it is unclear whether that meeting took place, the offer, mentioned in one of thousands of hacked Hillary Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks last week, was an example of the complex ethical issues the Clinton Foundation faced in managing relationships with foreign governments when she was secretary of state. It also raised questions about whether the foundation had fully followed procedures it had voluntarily agreed to in order to avoid those issues.

The foundation's ties to foreign governments and financiers have long been fodder for Hillary Clinton's critics — chief among them Donald Trump — who contend that foreigners used donations to the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons while Hillary Clinton was the country's top diplomat.

Emails released this year from her time at the State Department showed that foundation donors sought and in some cases obtained meetings with department officials. None showed that she had made decisions based on contributions to the foundation, and the Clinton campaign has said she never did.

But the appearance of special access was enough that the foundation announced this summer that if she was elected president, the foundation would cease accepting foreign donations.

Similar concerns were in the air in 2009, when she took office as secretary of state. So the foundation agreed then that it would ask the State Department to review donations from any new foreign government donors, or from existing donors that were looking to expand their giving significantly.

A State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said Saturday, ""We do not have a record of a submission"" from the Clinton Foundation related to a 2012 donation from Qatar.

In a hacked email from April 2012 released by WikiLeaks last week, Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation's foreign policy director, wrote to senior foundation aides that he had recently met with ambassadors from several nations, including Qatar, while in Washington.

Referring to Bill Clinton by his initials, he wrote that Qatar ""would like to see WJC for five minutes' in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for WJC's birthday in 2011."" He also said that Qatari officials ""would welcome our suggestions for investments in Haiti"" and that they had ""allocated most of their $20 million but are happy to consider projects we suggest.""

Qatar had donated to the foundation since 2002. The country, a tiny oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchy, has a complicated relationship with the United States; it is an ally, but it has also been suspected of quietly supporting militant Islamic groups.

Clinton Foundation officials said Saturday that they did not have to clear the $1 million gift with the State Department because it was not a ""material increase"" from Qatar's previous donation levels.

The claim, however, was impossible to verify because the foundation is not required to publicly report every donation it receives and has not done so.

""Qatar has been among our hundreds of thousands of donors who have supported the Clinton Foundation's overall humanitarian work, including making lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment available to millions of people in more than 70 countries, combating childhood obesity here in the United States and working to empower girls and women around the world,"" said Craig Minassian, a foundation spokesman.",16/10/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Democratic newcomer challenges Republican incumbent in race for Florida House District 65,"North Pinellas County voters will choose next month between Republican incumbent Chris Sprowls and Bernie Fensterwald, a Democratic political newcomer, for the District 65 seat in the Florida House of Representatives.

Both say they are the best man to represent the district, which covers parts of Clearwater, Dunedin, Palm Harbor and Tarpon Springs. But with stances that stiffly align with the parties they pledge, their plans for doing so are vastly different.

Sprowls, who was elected to the House for his first term in 2014, takes pride in the fact that he has lived in Pinellas since age 3. The son of a retired New York City homicide detective, he graduated from Stetson University College of Law in Gulfport, where he won a number of accolades and later helped start the school's Veterans Advocacy Clinic. Now 32, Sprowls works for a private law firm in Tampa following a seven-year stint as an assistant state attorney for Pasco and Pinellas counties.

This is a first shot at elected office for Fensterwald, 65, who moved to the area in 2009 from his home state of Virginia. His professional experience is varied — he practiced law for nearly 20 years before getting an education degree to become a school counselor, and all the while, has been involved in the management of a Virginia-based self-storage company.

As a strong proponent of the environment, Fensterwald says he decided to run for the spot after Sprowls voted in favor of fracking during the last legislative session. If elected, he says he plans to push toward addressing climate change and for solar power legislation that — unlike Amendment 1 that would give Floridians the right to have solar panels but still requires them to pay utility companies — is not tied to big business.

Fensterwald and Sprowls have gone head-to-head on a long list of other issues, too, one of the most contentious being in the education arena.

During his time in the House, Sprowls filed a successful bill about school choice, or the idealogy that parents should be able to choose from an array of education alternatives, such as charter schools, for their child, rather than be forced to enroll them in the public school they are zoned for.

""There is no one size fits all education model that fits all children,"" he said.

As someone with a brief time working in the education realm, Fensterwald disagrees and says school choice ""ultimately leads to schools becoming winners and losers.""

""State resources should be put into all schools to make them equally great, because if all schools are good then there is no need to have a choice,"" he said.

One thing they do agree on is that Amendment 2 — aimed to make medical marijuana available to a wider range of patients, including those with cancer, epilepsy, post traumatic stress disorder, HIV/AIDS and other debilitating medical conditions — would be better suited as a bill that could make its way through the Legislature, rather than a Constitutional amendment that, if passed, will be harder to change down the line.

Sprowls says he won't support it, for fear that passage in its current form would create a ""de-facto recreational marijuana system."" Fensterwald says his compassion for the sick is what pushed him to vote in favor.

""There are people out there that can benefit from it,"" he said. ""Yes, it will be harder to amend as part of the Constitution, but to me, it's a trade-off. The benefits of it outweigh the manner in which it is made legal.""

As a person who lived in Virginia at the time of the Virginia Tech massacre, Fensterwald has a strong stance against guns on college campuses. But Sprowls says it's important to him to protect the rights of innocent, licensed gun owners.

Under current legislation ""an individual can have a firearm in a car or truck while driving by a student … but the (licensed) student walking alone from class to their home cannot be armed,"" Sprowls said. ""That is an inequity that should not exist.""

Throughout the race, Fensterwald, who is still somewhat involved in self-storage business but boasts his elevated free time, has fired at Sprowls, saying he fears his professional life may take away from his ability to serve constituents.

""Every time someone asks me who I am running against, the response is usually 'Who's he?' "" Fensterwald said of his opponent.

But Sprowls says the criticisms are conjecture.

""For the first two years (in office) I successfully managed being a father, a husband, a lawyer and a successful member of the Florida Legislature,"" he said. ""Nothing has changed.""

Tampa Bay Times,From bad to baddest: The 10 nastiest corporations of the moment,"Bad companies — ones that rip off their customers, evade the law, cheat or simply show terrible judgment — are common enough. But it seems as if we're in the midst of a new round of poor decisions and calculated greed by a whole range of large corporations seemingly out only for themselves.

Everybody else? Take a number. Or get lost.

Everyone has a personal list of companies that have done them wrong and in some cases endangered and even taken lives. At least for now, here are the major companies that by their actions (or inaction), on purpose or by lack of foresight, or perhaps simply by stupidity and arrogance, make up the worst corporations in the current economy.

What follows is Trigaux's top 10, ranked from bad to badder to baddest. Take note of the number of times that the U.S. Justice Department is mentioned to be preparing enormous fines against the more outrageous conduct of these companies. Shame, shame, shame.

10. Spirit Airlines

In an industry that often infuriates travelers, Spirit manages to maintain its poor reputation with pride as the no-frills airline with the worst service. Fees galore. Infamously cramped seats. The American Customer Satisfaction Index's Travel Report for 2016 ranked the airline dead last. Here's proof that a company can be just plain bad without breaking laws or cheating consumers. People who fly Spirit know what they are getting.

9. BP

It's been more than six years since the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. How long does it take to forgive BP for its principal role in the worst oil spill in U.S. history — especially one that promises to have generations of damage to the waters off Florida's west coast? The answer is: a long time. We're not there yet. The release of the new Deepwater Horizon movie won't help BP's cause. There's a reason BP — not Exxon or Shell or Chevron — continues to pound the TV airwaves with ads devoted to feel-good safety issues.

8. Monsanto

The company has long been known as the despised poster child for genetically modified foods. The business has been described variously as sinister, hated and a corporate bully. ""Monsanto's reputation is disastrous, it's a mess,"" CEO Eric Schiffer of the advisory firm Reputation Management Consultants told Bloomberg. ""Monsanto is viewed as evil."" Here's one corporate solution: German drug giant Bayer, which in September agreed to acquire Monsanto, may get rid of the company's brand name. Is that all it takes to improve a company's reputation?

7. Turing Pharmaceuticals

Martin Shkreli made the list of greedy CEOs last year when he bought a drug company, then jacked up the price of a lifesaving drug from $13.50 per tablet to $750. Daraprim treats parasitic infections in HIV and cancer patients. ""Bad Boy of Pharma"" Shkreli, since arrested for fraud and forced to resign from his company, actually seems to enjoy the public lambasting he has received. On Twitter this past week, Shkreli solicited donations for the son of a deceased friend. The sweetener? Those who donated were entered into a lottery for the chance to hit him. The latest news report is the winner is a woman from, of course, Florida.

6. Deutsche Bank

The German bank, one of Europe's biggest financial institutions, faces a whopping $14 billion U.S. Department of Justice fine for mortgage shenanigans during the 2005-2007 global financial collapse. That's a lot of money, though Justice may settle for less. Deutsche joins other banks already accused of bundling poorly underwritten home loans and selling them as safer securities than they knew them to be. Those actions ultimately fueled a bubble in rising home prices and magnified the subsequent collapse.

5. Mylan

The drug company could be a twin of Turing (see No. 7) for Mylan's jacking up the price of its EpiPen, a lifesaving treatment for millions whose allergies can send them into severe shock. A pack of two lists for $608.61. That's up 548 percent, thanks to 17 price hikes by Mylan since it bought the rights to sell the drug in 2007. Here's the extra layer of sleaze: Gayle Manchin, who took over the National Association of State Boards of Education in 2012, lobbied to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions. That paved the way for Mylan to develop a near monopoly. Turns out Manchin is the mother of Mylan's CEO.

4. Wells Fargo

Lately, the bank (No. 2 in market share in Florida) that could once do no wrong seems unable to do anything right. Led by CEO John Stumpf, bank executives took too long to admit any responsibility for Wells Fargo's frenetic cross-selling culture that prompted the creation of 2 million fake customer accounts. Wells used to brag it pushed employee incentives to get the average customer to have more than six account relationships with the bank, more than most banks. What Wells isn't bragging about now is that too many employees felt extreme pressure to meet such sales goals. Worse, Wells talked about pushing those account averages even higher with ""eight is great"" and ""eleven is heaven"" marketing slogans.

3. Yahoo

Last month, Yahoo reported that hackers stole the account information of at least 500 million users — two years ago. It's the biggest known intrusion of one company's computer network. Hackers gained access to user names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, encrypted passwords and, in some cases, security questions. All this is staggering enough. So what happens if or when hackers start using all this personal identity information to gain access to more critical Internet services? I'm not sure if I should be more disturbed by the number of affected customers (greater than the entire U.S. population) or the extraordinary delay in time before Yahoo acknowledged (or even knew) what happened.

2. Takata

The Japanese safety airbag company failed to step up early on and fix its exploding airbag problem in major auto brands across the globe. Now the Justice Department may charge Takata with criminal wire fraud because of misleading statements and concealed information about airbags that can explode and spray shrapnel. The crisis is linked to more than a dozen deaths and more than 100 injuries globally, figures that may escalate. In this country alone, automakers are recalling nearly 70 million Takata airbags.

1. Volkswagen

This was a highly competitive contest to be the baddest of the bad companies in this top 10 list. VW still won hands down because its management did not fail by incompetence but actually conspired to cheat on emissions tests on a massive scale. VW admits it installed improper software to deactivate pollution controls on more than 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide. It agreed to spend as much as $16.5 billion in the United States to address emissions issues, including compensating owners of 475,000 2.0-liter diesel cars. Enter the U.S. Department of Justice. Again. The feds are now assessing how big a criminal fine they can extract from VW without putting the German carmaker out of business. So here's a question: What would VW have to do to be fined so much that it would go out of business?

Tampa Bay Times,Sen. Latvala and former Supreme Court Justice Bell declare opposition to Amendment 2,"The campaign against a medical marijuana constitutional amendment is rolling out high profile names who have joined their cause, including two on Friday: State Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, and former Florida Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Bell.

""I just see too many opportunities for abuse,"" said Latvala, who will be appropriations chairman next year. ""I'm concerned that the constitution is permanent. I just think that that's a big risk we're talking about with this amendment.""

Amendment 2 would expand medical marijuana in Florida, allowing doctors to recommend it for patients with a long list of conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Many opponents, including Latvala, say it could have disastrous effects: Teens with access to drugs, children going to the hospital after eating ""pot candy,"" an influx of dispensaries on every street corner in the state.

Bell said the Legislature won't be able to effectively regulate the medical cannabis industry because Amendment 2 will be in the constitution.

""Though shrewdly written, Amendment 2 does not belong in our constitution,"" he said.

However, the amendment explicitly allows for the Legislature to pass laws ""consistent with this section"" and for the Department of Health to write and enforce regulations.

Latvala is putting money into the race, as well, dipping into ""the lion's share"" of his well-padded campaign account to oppose Amendment 2. He has no opponent in his bid for re-election to the Senate. An ad he recorded opposing Amendment 2 begins airing this weekend in the Tampa Bay area on a $100,000 buy.

Supporters of Amendment 2 argue the Legislature has had its chance to enact a broad-based medical marijuana program after nearly 60 percent of voters approved a similar constitutional amendment in 2014. But Latvala believes the state has taken big steps, including a law signed this year that allows terminal patients within one year of death access to the drug, which Latvala opposed.

He's not the only senator who has weighed in on the medical marijuana initiative. Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, whose district is just south of Latvala's, announced his support for the initiative two weeks ago.

""The Legislature believes it knows better than physicians on how to treat patients,"" Brandes said in a statement at the time. ""And the only way we’re going to see meaningful change in that area is to put it in the Constitution.""

Update: United for Care, the political committee supporting Amendment 2, released a statement responding to criticism by Latvala and Bell.

“If the legislature had done their job in the first place, Senator Latvala wouldn’t have an amendment to oppose. They didn’t,"" said United for Care campaign manager Ben Pollara. ""If Senator Latvala is displeased that this issue is now before voters as a constitutional amendment, perhaps he should reflect on why the legislature failed to enact the people’s will.""",30/09/2016
Tampa Bay Times,A new frontier for Florida courts: Transgender name changes,"On a rainy summer afternoon inside the courthouse by the railroad tracks in Plant City, the case is halfway down the crowded docket.

Petitioner: Christine Rose Novak, it reads. Name change.

Weary-looking people fill the benches in family court, most of them here for divorces. But in the third row, wearing a vibrant blue necktie and the beginnings of a beard, sits the petitioner, his girlfriend at his side.

""Novak,"" the bailiff calls.

The petitioner stands, starting to sweat. He wonders if the judge will be judgmental. He has had some experience with judgmental.

Hillsborough Circuit Judge Tracy Sheehan waves him up close to the bench, looks into his file, asks a few questions.

""And you are currently Christine Rose?"" she says.

Yes.

""And you wish to change your name to Christopher Skye?""

""Yes ma'am,"" says Novak, 27.

By now the restless audience has stilled to listen. ""He's a girl?"" a woman whispers to her friend.

No criminal record, the judge notes, and nothing to indicate you're doing this to duck a debt. She looks at a driver's license photo that could be his pretty sister. Then she peers over her glasses at him.

She says she is glad to be part of this moment. ""You look every bit Christopher,"" she says. Papers are signed, dated, stamped. ""You are now a young man, officially on paper,"" the judge says. The whole thing takes only a few minutes.

He walks out of court with his girlfriend. The rain has stopped. Legally, he is who he feels like he has been for a long time. He has a name that sounds like himself. He is, officially, Christopher.

• • •

In Florida, as long as it's not for nefarious purposes like avoiding a bankruptcy or hiding a criminal record, you can change your name for pretty much any reason. Pay your fee ($414 in Hillsborough County, $395 in Pinellas), submit your paperwork, show up for your court date. You don't even need a lawyer.

A Miami-Dade judge recently granted a local artist's request to henceforth be known as Leonardo da Vinci. A Florida man with the last name Dudah once legally made his first name Zippidy.

Often, name change requests are about restoring former names after divorces or making sure the name someone has been using matches the one on his birth certificate. But at this moment in history — when even small- town America knows Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn and the president himself has weighed in on bathrooms in schools — judges are seeing more of another kind of name change on their dockets: Transgender people who want their names to reflect not the sex to which they were born, but the one with which they identify.

Because the required forms don't ask why someone wants a new name, it's difficult to say how many gender-based requests are sprinkled amongst the hundreds that pass through local courtrooms each year. But on both sides of Tampa Bay, judges say the numbers are up.

""There have been more over the last year or two than I had previously seen,"" says Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Jack Helinger, who has been on the bench eight years. Among his cases have been teenagers, who must have the consent of both parents.

Some local judges handle gender-based name changes at the bench or move them to the end of the docket to avoid any reaction from the audience. A petitioner isn't required to bring documents from a doctor specifying details of transitioning — counseling, hormone therapy, surgery — though judges say they often do.

For the unfamiliar, transgender issues can be uncharted territory: terms like nonbinary, pangender and — instead of Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms. or a gender-neutral honorific used in Britain, Mx. (It's unclear how wide usage could be here, though the term was added to Merriam-Webster Unabridged in April.)

An August conference for Florida judges included a class on transgender matters in court. One question: How do they properly address someone standing in front of them asking for a name of a different gender?

Miss or Mr.?

He or she?

""I don't want to insult anyone,"" says Hillsborough Circuit Judge Michael Scionti, elected to the bench in 2014.

The simplest solution: Ask. ""I'll ask, 'Jonathan Smith, how do you prefer the court address you?' And they'll say, 'Judge, I prefer 'Miss Smith,' "" Scionti says. ""And that seems to be working well.""

It sounds simplistic that people in court should be called by the right name and pronoun, says Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Scott Bernstein, chairman of the Florida Supreme Court Standing Committee on Fairness and Diversity. ""But you wouldn't believe what impact that has on a litigant,"" he says.

As the Trans and Youth Program Coordinator at Metro Health, Wellness & Community — a St. Petersburg and Tampa nonprofit that began as an HIV service organization and provides LGBT primary care, therapy, counseling and support groups — Lucas Wehle finds himself helping two or three people a week negotiate the legal name- change process he has been through himself.

""Especially lately,"" says Wehle, 24.

He goes through the paperwork with them step by step and sends them to the police department for fingerprints for the required background check. He tells them to get copies of birth certificates and, ""I don't know, your cat's middle name"" — to make sure nothing's missing.

His mother cried when he changed his name. His father wanted him to wait. They have come around since, he says.

""Names are super important,"" he says.

Changing your name is a turning point, Wehle says. But it can also be as practical as the cashier who wouldn't let him pay for his lunch because of the feminine-sounding name printed on his card.

""Most of the time it's ignorance,"" Wehle says. But on occasion, ""you'll find the anger,"" too.

Transgender name changes tend to get granted without much fuss.

But earlier this year in Augusta, Ga., Superior Court Judge J. David Roper declined to change the name of a college student from Rebeccah Elizabeth to Rowan Elijah Feldhaus.

""I don't know anybody named Elijah who's female,"" the judge said, according to a court transcript. ""I'm not going to do that. I've never heard of that. And I know who Elijah was, one of the greatest men who ever lived.""

Months later, he ruled similarly in the case of a transgender man who wanted to legally become Andrew Baumert, the name by which he said everyone already knew him. The judge refused. ""My policy has been that I will not change a name from an obviously female to an obviously male name, and vice versa,"" he said.

The judge did say he could ""live with"" the petitioner picking a ""gender-neutral"" name and suggested Shannon, Shaun or Bobby. ""Even Morgan is now transgender,"" Roper said. ""Jamie, whatever.""

Baumert declined. Both cases are on appeal.

But this resistance appears to be the exception and not the rule.

""Most states have treated transgender folks like they treat all other people before them asking for a name change,"" says Beth Littrell, senior attorney with Lambda Legal, the national LGBT legal advocacy group that's handling the appeals. They are hopeful about the legal precedent these cases could set. A decision in the Elijah matter is expected by April.

How do you pick a new name for the rest of your life?

Obviously, the decision is intensely personal. Some people try on names with friends or support groups and discard what doesn't fit. Some peruse baby names popular now or when they were born. Some take the names of relatives or famous people. Some ask their parents: What would you have called me if I had been a boy? If I were born a girl?

Others say they have quietly carried around what seemed like their real name for years.

Whatever it is, ""you need to identify with it,"" Wehle says.

Once a high school football star and homecoming king, Gina Duncan is now the transgender inclusion director for Equality Florida in Orlando, helping businesses and corporations develop fully inclusive transgender policies and procedures.

Here is how she got her name when she started to transition from male to female a decade ago:

""For some reason, the trend seemed to be you chose the most flamboyant name that you thought was the most feminine,"" she says. She picked Tiffany. ""I must have known four different Tiffanys that were transgender"" at the time, she said. (Others report picking names considered hyper-masculine, like Phoenix.)

Over dinner, she told friends. ""They all kind of turned their noses up and said, 'You don't really look like a Tiffany.' "" Someone said she looked Italian — maybe a Gina.

""It made a lot of sense in that my old name was Greg,"" she says. ""I became Gina.""

""It was all very random. But it had a lot of meaning for me.""

She also remembers snickers in the courtroom the day she made it legal. It came from court personnel.

• • •

Advocates say a legal name change can be an important psychological, social and emotional step — particularly given a transgender population in which a stunning 41 percent report having attempted suicide. It's a population that also reports high rates of discrimination and harassment.

A name that matches your gender identity — and how you look, dress and present yourself — is ""a very simple way that the world validates you as who you are,"" say Mira Krishnan, a Michigan neuropsychologist and diversity consultant who has worked on LGBT issues. ""It has a sense of feeling right.""

""It's funny — people will say to me, 'I forgot what your name was before,' "" says Krishnan, who legally changed her name two years ago. ""I do, too.""

Some won't speak their former name. It's called ""dead-naming"" when someone else insists on using it.

""When I use my birth name, it's kind of like lying,"" says JJ Martinez, a 27-year-old Tampa college student who came out as a transgender man at 19. ""Pretending to be somebody I've really never been.""

Novak, the Plant City petitioner who hopes to become a chef, says a new name is like saying goodbye and then welcoming who you are.

""Your happier self,"" he says.

Transgender activists say that carrying around a name that doesn't match how a person looks can even be dangerous. It can attract the kind of attention ""that can lead to harassment, abuse, even violence,"" says Littrell of Lambda Legal.

According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 40 percent of respondents reported being harassed when they used an ID that did not match their gender expression. Fifteen percent were asked to leave an establishment. Three percent said they were assaulted or attacked.

""It's not like you wake up one day and say, 'Oh, this is who I can be,' "" Martinez says. ""Nobody would choose to do something that could get them killed.""

Judges say they see the weight of this in court.

""I've heard from enough transgender folks who tell me the day they get their name change — something which they celebrate like you and I might celebrate a birthday — they view this as almost like a rebirth for them,"" says Judge Bernstein.

""I sense some relief,"" says Judge Scionti.

""Sometimes,"" says Judge Helinger, ""it is truly moving on to another chapter of life.""

He got to the Hillsborough courthouse ready to become Jeremiah Josiah ""JJ"" Martinez and leave Tiffany Lynn behind three hours before his hearing was supposed to start. He wore a suit — dress for success, his mother always said — prompting a woman in the courtroom to consult him for lawyerly advice in her divorce.

The bailiff said he was last on the docket. By the time his case was called, he was shaking.

The judge asked why he wanted this. He said he wanted his name on the college degree he was about to get, and one day on his children's birth certificates. Later he would remember she smiled. Granted.

Here is what happened afterward:

""Have you ever seen this thing where a guy excuses himself from a meeting, goes in a room and does a little dance?"" he says. ""I did that in the hallway.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Scarlett Johansson, St. Petersburg singer Kendra Morris release charity cover of New Order's 'Bizarre Love Triangle'","Did you know Scarlett Johansson had a pop band? You probably did. She’s an accomplished singer who’s released several albums, including 2009’s pretty great Break Up with Pete Yorn.

But did you also know one of her bandmates has, for a while now, been St. Petersburg native Kendra Morris?

Morris, 35, and Johansson sing together in a group called Sugar for Sugar, along with singers Julia Haltigan and Holly Miranda. On Thursday they dropped one of their first releases, a cover of New Order’s Bizarre Love Triangle for the HIV/AIDS research organization amfAR. It’s part of The Time Is Now, a compilation of ’80s covers by artists like Aloe Blacc (Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean), Phantogram (Phil Collins’ Take Me Home) and DNCE (Tina Turner’s What’s Love Got to Do With It).

A former University of South Florida student who now lives in New York, Morris — the daughter of Tampa Bay Times artist Don Morris — knows a thing or two about quality covers. In 2014 she released Mockingbird, a covers album featuring vintage soul versions of songs by Radiohead, Metallica, David Bowie and Soundgarden, among others. She’s also dropped several albums of her own music, including Babble, released this summer.

Sugar for Sugar isn’t Morris’ first project with Johansson. They formerly collaborated with Haim’s Este Haim in electro-pop group the Singles, whose song Candy was produced by TV On the Radio’s Dave Sitek.

Morris will be back in St. Petersburg in November, performing at the new Et Cultura arts festival on Nov. 19. Click here for details.

Tampa Bay Times,"What to watch and listen to this weekend: 'The Exorcist,' Here Be Monsters podcast","Watch this weekend

The Exorcist, 9 p.m., Friday, Fox

Only time and more episodes will tell if Fox can deliver quality long-term horror in its small screen remake of The Exorcist. The Exorcist follows a similar vein as the 1973 original: A well-to-do suburban family becomes victim to demonic possession, and two very different priests are determined to save them. The two stories occur in the same universe, confirmed by a newspaper article about the Georgetown events 40-some years earlier.

Director Rupert Wyatt's take carries on the spirit of the original quite nicely. The scenes are blanketed in the crisp blues and steely grays of a chilly Chicago autumn. The calm of suburban life is punctuated by feverish shots of Father Marcus Keane (Ben Daniels) attempting to exorcise a young boy in Mexico City. But that's really where the similarities end. The pilot isn't very pilot-y. It jumps right in and assumes every viewer has already seen the original. (Who hasn't?)

Review: Fox's The Exorcist delivers on recreating the dreary, insidious spirit of the original

Transparent, midnight Friday, Amazon: Season 3 of Transparent, Amazon's outstanding half-hour drama (not a comedy, but we'll get to that later), reminds us why we need a show like this. Maura Pfefferman (Emmy winner Jeffrey Tambor) now works at a LGBTQ crisis hotline. While she's still trying to navigate her own new world, Maura wants to provide the help and encouragement she never received. It's a chaotic episode to open with, but it provides a glimpse of what's to come this season. Here are just some topics touched upon in this 10-episode season: white privilege, suicide, HIV and the Holocaust. Not necessarily funny stuff, right? While some of the best shows on TV successfully combine drama and humor, Transparent doesn't provide much, or any, comedic relief. And that's okay. — Brittany Volk, [email protected]

NEW Easy, midnight Friday, Netflix: This cast: Orlando Bloom, Malin Akerman, Dave Franco, Hannibal Buress. That's not even all of them. The eight-episode comedy is set in Chicago as all these people navigate love, sex and technology.

NEW MacGyver, 8 p.m. Friday, CBS: The reboot of the ABC series from the '80s revives the know-it-all character Angus MacGyver, played by Lucas Till (X-Men) updated for the digital age.

NEW Van Helsing, 10 p.m. Friday, SyFy: Luckily, this series has nothing to do with the campy Hugh Jackman film from 2004. Vanessa Helsing (Kelly Overton) is the daughter of Dracula's nemesis, Abraham Van Helsing, and awakens in a postapocalyptic world overrun with vampires. Hemophobes, this show is not for you.

Tampa Bay Times,Giles Corey saw Hillary fly on a broom and collapse!,"Let us suppose, for a moment, that everything we have ever heard about Hillary Clinton's health is true.

She has had multiple strokes. Also, she has multiple sclerosis.

She depends upon a stool.

She has Parkinson's. And HIV.

She might or might not have asthma.

She has one year left to live.

There are at least two so-called Hillary Clintons. One is a body double. Both wear adult diapers, which accounts for the shape of their garments, but they are not very subtle about it, so that many YouTube users were able to notice and comment.

She is constantly suffering from seizures, blackouts, falls and collapses.

She has unspecified heart trouble.

She has lupus.

Also, ""there's special needs there"" (Rep. Louie Gohmert's words, not mine) and the only way to help her is through the power of prayer.

(This is probably just one of the many pernicious side effects of taking an extraterrestrial as a lover.)

Every time she puts together a coherent sentence, it is a minor miracle. It requires a team of armor-clad specialists to prop her upright at all times. Picture what Franklin Delano Roosevelt had to do to conceal his polio, then multiply it by a factor of 10.

When you contemplate all of this, it is amazing all that she has accomplished. Just by way of comparison, I came down with a slight cold this weekend and have been prone on the couch ever since beneath a giant mound of tissues. And she has been secretary of state, served in the Senate and run for president twice, all while LITERALLY DYING at every possible moment.

I was willing to cut her some slack. But now, surely as a speaker on the main stage of the Republican National Convention, the question of her Numerous Ailments has moved from the Fringe Conspiracy Zone into the Mainstream Conversation. Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday, a fact she had to admit Sunday after she overheated at a 9/11 commemoration and stumbled on the way to her van, prompting demand for increased transparency about her health.

Not the transparency we have now, though. A better transparency. After all, we have gotten her medical records before — about that blood clot and concussion — and they somehow said nothing about the adult diapers or body doubles. We must not allow the wool to be pulled over our eyes any longer.

Doctors cannot be trusted. Does Donald Trump's doctor even exist?

And sure, they both released some new health details on Wednesday, but that's not enough.

No, if we really want to feel at ease about what is going on with Hillary Clinton's health, as well as about those rumors that her glance can curdle milk, that the cat Socks was her long-term familiar, and that Trump looks the way he does because Clinton once looked at him with the Evil Eye and will not allow his virile member to return to him, there is only one approach to take.

We must test her correctly. She must be placed upon a ducking stool, then weighed against a sack of Bibles, and then we must hear Giles Corey's testimony against her. We must learn: Does soaking a cake in her urine and feeding it to a dog cause her to cry out in pain? Does her body bear the Devil's Teat? Does she mutter to herself? Did Abigail see her dance in the glen with the Lord Beelzebub, then fly off into the night with a loud cry?

Then, at last, we can rest assured.

P.S.: Donald Trump should undergo all these procedures, too, or he is definitely a witch. And release his tax returns, while he is at it.

Tampa Bay Times,"Perspective: Politics, and public health","The growing mosquito-transmitted Zika outbreak in Florida — with more than 400 confirmed cases, dozens of them locally transmitted, not travel-related — reminded us of a similar threat to the public health when we were young doctors, and the politics that put people at risk.

In February 1973, the mayor of Miami Beach drank a glass of water in front of a bank of network cameras and basically said ""come on down, the water's fine"" — except, it wasn't. Then, there was a different disease brewing, water-borne typhoid fever.

February is prime tourist season in Miami, and the fact that we and other physicians were seeing very sick patients in a typhoid fever epidemic, the largest in the United States since the 1930s, made little difference — mainly because those affected were migrant farm workers. Then, as now, money, politics and scientific ignorance trumped public health.

We were resident physicians at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, staffing the South Dade Community Health Center, a collection of double-wide trailers 25 miles south of Miami that served the poor, minority and migrant farm worker population. One of the trailers functioned as one of the few emergency rooms between Key West and Miami, and we covered the nights.

We were seeing more gastrointestinal illness than usual, and a few nights later, the waiting room was filled with extraordinarily sick people. After examining four or five patients, it became clear they had the same illness, and they came from the same migrant labor camp 10 miles farther south. Entire families were ill, most were Mexicans on the migrant farm worker trail, here for one harvest, then heading off to another.

They had high fevers, 101 and above, but instead of an expected tachycardia, or rapid pulse, they had bradycardia, slow pulses, known as Faget's sign, and a characteristic of typhoid fever. We called our lab tech for a consult. He had recently fled Cuba, where he'd been a physician, and he'd seen more typhoid than we had. He concurred in our diagnosis, and we started collecting blood and stool samples.

In the morning we called the Miami Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control.

At first, the Miami Health Department didn't take us seriously, but the CDC did. We watched, weeks later, as epidemiologists poured dye in one of the canals crisscrossing the migrant camp, and when they turned on the faucets, we saw the water turn blue with the same dye. By that time, the people had left their slum housing. Typhoid is a food- or water-borne disease, and in several later reports about the outbreak, ""faulty plumbing and sanitation"" was the euphemistic explanation for gross incompetence and neglect.

Later that spring, a raid on a migrant camp resulted in charges of peonage or debt slavery, and involuntary servitude brought against the labor contractor who ran it and kept people virtual prisoners, particularly if they owed ""the company store."" Several cases of active TB were found among the workers.

All told, there were at least 225 confirmed cases of typhoid. Families were separated among Miami area hospitals, already at full capacity. The CDC remained busy tracking folks throughout the country who might have been exposed before they left the camp. And in early March, after the mayor drank his glass of water and invited everybody down, a test of the Miami Beach water supply didn't find typhoid. Instead, it revealed a history of very high levels of fecal e-coli, ostensibly due to a faulty chlorinator.

We would hope that by now, post-Ebola and HIV/AIDS, the U.S. Congress would know that infectious diseases can spread at more than 500 miles an hour, or like Zika, by both jets and the inexorable migration of insect and other vectors north with climate change. But Congress, bickering over what should go in a Zika bill and seemingly indifferent to the serious challenge, went home for recess without acting even as the problem grew worse. And while berating the feds for their inaction, Gov. Rick Scott, a former health system executive who should know better, still has not admitted the threat that climate change poses to his state, including its role in the spread of Zika by expanding the carrier mosquito's habitat.

Our public health guardians — the CDC, the U.S. Public Health Service, other federal and state agencies, and most of all, the awareness of front-line practitioners — have kept our country relatively safe from scourges affecting the rest of the world. They've been doing this in spite of bare bones funding for public health. The public health community in Florida is working overtime, trying to stop a potentially devastating epidemic. So far, we've been lucky.

Many years ago, during the Typhoid epidemic, we inadvertently learned about the almost inseparable toxic mix of health, politics and power. We've watched the same poisonous combination frustrate and delay the treatment of AIDS, Ebola, H5N1 virus and so many other diseases.

Recently, politicians sipped Flint River water in Michigan and said it's safe, and thousands of kids' lead levels are being monitored because it wasn't. Others say the mosquitoes are under control, just restricted to a couple of blocks. The stories hardly change, but the climate has, and the diseases already have, and will continue to do so.

One small step that could separate science and health from the mire of politics and power would be to deny our votes to those politicians who deny science. They should not be making critical decisions about our health and our future.

Tampa Bay Times,"Politifact checks Clinton on ""superpredators"" and Trump on donation to Clinton Foundation","Supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took a week's worth of attack lines to the Sunday shows, arguing about the propriety of the Clinton Foundation and Trump's appeals to African-American voters.

Defending Trump's claim that Clinton is a ""bigot,"" GOP chairman Reince Priebus argued that Clinton at the least has taken the black vote for granted.

""She's the one that labeled African-American youth as 'superpredators,' "" Priebus said on NBC's Meet the Press.

That attack, which Trump had also made days earlier on Twitter, rates Mostly True. Clinton did use the term, but Priebus left out some context.

'Superpredators' speech from 1996

The ""superpredators"" line comes from a 1996 speech in which Clinton praised the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act signed into law by her husband, then-President Bill Clinton.

Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, but it has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison.

After praising the law's support for community policing, Hillary Clinton said the law would beef up efforts to fight gangs.

""They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore,"" Clinton said. ""They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators — no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel.""

Clinton did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech suggests it was a reasonable inference.

Those remarks followed Clinton into this year's election, when activists with the Black Lives Matter movement confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling her she owed black people an apology. A day later, Clinton released a statement expressing regret for her word choice.

""Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,"" she said.

Trump's donation to Clinton Foundation

Trump has also been attacking Clinton for conflicts of interest surrounding her family's foundation. But Democrats have counterattacked by pointing out that Trump himself donated to the nonprofit he now calls a pay-to-play operation.

Addressing the topic on Meet the Press, President Barack Obama's former campaign manager David Plouffe noted the Clinton Foundation's work on HIV/AIDS and malaria, and Trump's own ties to the charity.

""The Clinton Foundation, I think it's a universal agreement, has done remarkable work around the world. I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation,"" he said.

Plouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that money likely came through Trump's own foundation, not directly from Trump. The claim rates Mostly True.

The Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000. Tax forms show that the Donald J. Trump Foundation (which Trump controls) donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2009 and reserved a table at a 2010 Clinton Foundation gala for $10,000.

Trump's gift places him in the top 0.2 percent of the foundation's donors. Most of its 300,000 donors (85.5 percent) gave less than $250.

Breaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump's total contribution isn't that big. We estimated that the foundation received at least $800 million in donations, with over 70 percent of which came from gifts of $1 million or more.

Trump doesn't deny that he donated to the Clinton Foundation. During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily mentioned it.

""When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,"" Trump said. ""With Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn't have a choice, because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world.""

For the record, the Clintons did attend Trump's third wedding, to Melania Knauss, but that occurred in 2005, four years before the $100,000 donation.

A few months later, Trump gave similar answers when asked to explain his charitable giving record.

""I did give to the Clinton Foundation. What I didn't know is they'd be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. So, it didn't make any difference to me,"" he said on Jan. 31's Fox News Sunday. ""Again, I was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everybody, including the Clintons, including Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Column: Tell Congress to move forward on the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria","While politicians and much of the public are keenly focused on elections right now, we must remember we have a government that needs to operate. Congress is out through August, and all representatives plus a third of the senators are running for re-election. But the people's business must be done.

Consider two matters that call for action: the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and the Reach Every Mother and Child Act.

The Global Fund is an innovative partnership among governments, communities and the private sector. It supports programs facilitated by local experts in countries and communities where there is the greatest need. The Global Fund now has a plan to help save 8 million lives and prevent 300 million new infections from HIV, TB and malaria by 2020.

With bipartisan congressional support, the United States has always led the fund as its largest single donor, leveraging $2 from other donors for every $1 we contribute. The fund's regular replenishment conference is coming up in September in Montreal, and President Barack Obama should again step up with U.S. leadership. A strong U.S. pledge will leverage billions of dollars in contributions from partner countries from their own domestic budgets and produce up to an estimated $290 billion in economic gains as these countries become healthier, more productive societies.

The spread of the Zika virus proves once again that infectious diseases, TB and AIDS included, do not respect international borders. We Floridians, with all our international visitors and what we now know about nonsexual transmission of Zika, are particularly vulnerable.

Not only does U.S. support of the Global Fund fulfill our moral commitment to the world community, but it also stands up well compared to China's influence in Africa. China's self-serving policy seeks prestige as the Middle Kingdom, the center of the universe as they see it.

Now for the second item that requires government action in September: the Reach Every Mother and Child Act. It already enjoys bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.

The numbers that form the background of this legislation are practically incomprehensible as well as morally repugnant. In 1990, 12.7 million children around the world died before reaching their fifth birthday; in 2015, that number had fallen to 5.9 million children, according to UNICEF. Over 17,000 children still die each day from preventable diseases such as diarrhea, malnutrition and pneumonia. Thousands of mothers die too. How important is your mother to your own life's progress? Ours are still with us in spirit every single day.

The Reach Act takes proven successful practices of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and codifies them into law so they will survive a change in the administration, in Congress and at USAID. These practices are recognized for their effectiveness, accountability, transparency and strategic orientation. We can be proud of this progress and ensure that it continues.

But even with bipartisan support in both houses of Congress, there may be little impetus to pass the Reach Act in these days of preoccupation with elections. This would be a big mistake. With support from well more than one-third of the House and more than a quarter of the Senate, passage of this legislation is a no-brainer.

Our local representatives — Dennis Ross, Kathy Castor, David Jolly and Gus Bilirakis — have co-sponsored the bill and we applaud them. Sens. Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio support the Senate version. In particular, we acknowledge Reps. Ross and Jolly for their early support, which led other Republicans to sign on. Their foresight and influence came through for mothers and children around the globe. They recognize their leadership roles as Republicans in the House. This partisan transcendence needs to continue no matter how the election turns out.

The president and Congress must remember that they are here to govern as well as get elected. Let them know who's boss. Go to the president's website and thank him for what he's done in the past and tell him to give the same level of support to the Global Fund in September. Go to your representative's and senators' websites and thank them for their recent support of the Reach Act and ask for their support to pass the bill this year. How about September? Both save lives. Isn't that one of your dreams? It certainly is ours.

Tampa Bay Times,Judge blocks Ohio law to divert Planned Parenthood money,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — A federal judge blocked an Ohio law aimed at diverting public money from Planned Parenthood, saying in a Friday ruling that the group stood to suffer ""irreparable injury.""

The state law targets the more than $1.4 million in funding that Planned Parenthood gets through Ohio's health department. That money, which is mostly from the federal government, supports certain education and prevention programs. The Ohio law would bar such funds from going to entities that perform or promote abortions.

The restrictions, which had been slated to take effect in May, were signed by Republican Gov. John Kasich during his failed presidential bid.

The state's Republican attorney general will appeal the ruling, his spokesman said.

Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region had sued the state, claiming the law violated their constitutional rights by denying them the funds ""in retaliation for"" providing abortions. The lawsuit names the state's health director as a defendant.

U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett in Cincinnati sided with Planned Parenthood on Friday in granting a permanent injunction that keeps state officials from enforcing the law's provisions.

The judge said in many instances, Planned Parenthood was chosen over other entities to receive the funds as part of a competitive grant process. He said if the changes were to take effect, the group couldn't offer some free services and also would no longer have access to the juvenile justice and foster care systems to teach teenagers about healthy relationships.

If not blocked, Barrett wrote, Planned Parenthood would ""suffer a continuing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.""

The state's attorneys had argued Planned Parenthood was trying to override state policy choices, and no entity has a constitutional right to receive public money.

""Planned Parenthood supplies no basis for disturbing Ohio's legislative judgments about how to spend its public money,"" attorneys wrote in a court brief.

Planned Parenthood has said Ohio's law would not force any of its 28 health centers in the state to close, but the legislation would deprive thousands of patients' access to HIV tests, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and other prevention and education initiatives.

The group's attorneys argued the law was unconstitutional because it requires, as a condition of receiving government funds, that recipients abandon their constitutionally protected rights to free speech and to provide abortion services.

Planned Parenthood officials praised the decision, calling it a win for Ohioans who rely on the organization for care.

""Politicians have no business blocking patients from the care they need — and today the court stopped them in their tracks,"" said Iris Harvey, the head of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.

Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, women have a constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is able to survive outside the womb, generally around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Planned Parenthood is a national target because of its role as the largest U.S. abortion provider.

Ohio Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that lobbied in support of the funding changes, said the judge's ruling violates the state's rights and the conscience rights of taxpayers.

""It is the public policy of the state of Ohio to prefer childbirth over abortion, and we should be allowed to allocate funds accordingly,"" said Katie Franklin, a spokeswoman.

Federal law and the laws of most states already prevent public money from paying for abortions except in rare circumstances, but the recent defunding bills prohibit state money for any services by an organization that also provides abortions.

According to Planned Parenthood, politicians in 24 states have either enacted or proposed measures since last July that target the organization with defunding.

In most of the 24 states, the cuts haven't taken effect. Some measures have been blocked by the courts or put on hold over litigation, and a defunding bill in Virginia was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.",12/08/2016

Tampa Bay Times,Hudson man is one of first in the state to receive medical marijuana,"PALM HARBOR — Richard Murphy has been trying for two years to re-create the life he had before the semi truck rammed into the side of his Ford F-150.

Although doctors said he'd likely never recognize his wife or function normally, Murphy, 61, of Hudson can now walk, talk and take care of himself for the most part. The biggest lingering problems are the unpredictable seizures that come daily, and the headaches and irritability from the drugs meant to control them.

Ever since her husband was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, Pamela Murphy knew a potential miracle treatment was out there, just out of reach because of legal red tape and stigma.

But on a visit to his neurologist's office in Palm Harbor on Monday, Richard Murphy became one of the first in the state to buy cannabidiol spray under a 2014 law allowing patients with cancer or seizures access to a strain of medical marijuana that does not cause a euphoric high.

""It's been a long time coming,"" Pamela Murphy, said. ""I'm excited that at our age, we're showing that we're not out here looking to get high. We're hoping to remove that stigma. … This is natural. If it replaces all the chemicals he's taking now, we'll be good.""

It was also the first delivery for Surterra Therapeutics, which launched in 2014 and has grow facilities in Tampa and Tallahassee that raise the cannabis plant from seedling to final product.

Although the state has approved six dispensing organizations, only Surterra and one other, Trulieve, have begun delivering products to patients. Along with the orange-flavored oral spray Murphy will use three times a day under his tongue, Surterra also produces an oral oil and topical lotion.

""We've got to make sure we're empowering patients, so this is very exciting,"" said Susan Driscoll, president of Surterra, which plans to open its first wellness center on Fowler Avenue in Tampa this month and will make home deliveries of the strain until the dispensaries open.

Dr. Lisa M. Avery, who has treated Murphy's seizures for two years with a variety of drugs, said she has been waiting for this opportunity since she was a medical student in 1999 observing experimental cannabis treatment for seizures in monkeys.

To join the state registry of physicians eligible to prescribe medical cannabis, Avery, a neurologist, completed an eight-hour continuing-education course. She is one of 99 physicians in the state able to prescribe the drug.

Driscoll said once patients are written a prescription, they must purchase the product through a state-approved dispensary, which is required to confirm their name on the state's patient registry before the sale.

The law allows only patients suffering from cancer or seizures to be prescribed the high-cannabidiol, low-THC strain while terminal patients have access to the higher THC dosage.

There are 57 patients on what's called the Compassionate Use Registry, 30 of whom have open orders placed by their physicians, according to the Florida Department of Health.

But if passed by voters Nov. 8, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative, known as Amendment 2, would broaden the list of diseases that qualify for medical marijuana, like glaucoma, HIV, post-traumatic stress disorder and multiple sclerosis.

Avery said the most hopeful benefit of cannabidiol treatment is that it has the potential to cure seizures. And while other seizure medications can cause kidney stones, birth defects, lower bone density and other side effects, medical marijuana is thought to have none of those.

""I've seen the effects,"" said Avery, who hopes to dedicate her practice at Cann Health on U.S. 19 to treating patients with medical marijuana. ""Patients can gain control, reduce other medications and really see benefits.""

Tampa Bay Times,Florida's HIV/AIDS chief resigns,"The head of the Florida Department of Health's HIV/AIDS section is stepping down.

Marlene LaLota, who has been with DOH for more than 25 years resigned on July 26 ""to pursue new challenges,"" according to a letter obtained by the Times/Herald.

""I will always treasure the amazing HIV staff here and in the field,"" she wrote. ""I feel so privileged to have served Floridians living with or at risk for HIV and I believe that I have made a difference in their lives.""

LaLota's resignation comes on the heels of controversy regarding the state's HIV numbers. After reporting a staggering number of new HIV infections for several years, DOH altered the data, decreasing the number of cases in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613.

Under congressional pressure and following reporting by the Times/Herald about the HIV data, DOH in May released more details about its process for removing duplicate cases from the data and said the altered numbers reflected a more accurate count.

South Florida remains one of the epicenters of the disease in the United States.

LaLota's last day in the office is Sept. 1, and she will be on state payroll through Dec. 2, according to her resignation letter.",04/08/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Thursday's letters: Cannabis has track record of helping the sick,"Amendment 2

A track record of helping the sick

Amendment 2, the medical cannabis initiative, can help sick Floridians.

Whom does cannabis help? It has already been shown over two decades (California was the first in 1996) to help those with cancer, epilepsy, Crohn's disease, glaucoma, anxiety, IBS, HIV/AIDS, Huntington's disease, PTSD, depression, MS, chronic pain, migraines and drug dependence, among many other conditions.

As for cannabis being a street drug, everything is a street drug until you legalize it, regardless of how it should be treated (see Prohibition). Why does the language leave it open to doctors to prescribe as they see fit for what they see fit? Because that's what every doctor-patient relationship should be like.

As for why it hasn't been proven effective in research, if a drug is Schedule 1 it's illegal to conduct peer-reviewed research. As such, the evidence is anecdotal. But 58 percent of Floridians wanted this option as medicine two years ago — that's 11.5 million of our neighbors, for reference.

Science isn't always the answer | July 10

Improving our lives

Recently the Times has printed several letters and even a opinion piece from science deniers. This is sad in a number of ways. All of these letter writers' lives have been greatly improved by science. Go to a doctor; medicine is 100 percent science. Everyday things from turning on a TV to be informed to driving a car are all science-based.

I consider the science deniers to be part of the ""dumbing down"" of our country. Witness the biblical museum and recently opened ""ark"" attraction in Kentucky, both depicting man and dinosaurs living together a la the Flintstones, when in fact the two are separated by 65 million years.

No matter how fervently you believe something, that does not make it true. Climate change deniers are in the same boat.

Campaign 2016

The view from up close

As a New Yorker, I had a box seat to Donald Trump. He is not a good businessman. He is not well informed. He is not honest or trustworthy. He is not a decent human being.

His behavior on the world stage amounts to the antics of a 9-year-old with developmental issues.

Those who stand by him, the so-called white middle class or to put it more clearly, the undereducated, are in a bad economic situation due to their poor choices. Screwing in a light bulb at the local factory is not a job that would have been sustainable given technology advancements. These members of the middle class are out of work not solely because of bad trade deals but because these jobs are now performed by technology.

Trump will fix none of these situations. Take it from a Queens kid who has seen this train wreck of a man up close.

Tony Vittorio, Clearwater

Morally bankrupt

Donald Trump is a moral catastrophe and a threat to our people, nation and democratic principles.

Those Republican politicians at the local, state and national levels who have endorsed Trump have done so to preserve the support of their political base. In other words, they are simply acting to benefit themselves and their political positions — not the citizens. They are acting in a morally bankrupt manner and the entire lot of them should be voted out of office.

Walt Mickler, Tampa

Candidate as bully

The death of a child, regardless of his or her age, is a holocaust of loss that barely diminishes with time. You get through it, but you never get over it. For Donald Trump to criticize Ghazala Khan in any way speaks to his lack of compassion, common sense and, most importantly, competence. Trump is a narcissistic bully who, like most malignant narcissists, can only experience his own pain. The Khans' sacrifice of their son pales in Trump's mind to his ""sacrifice of losing sleep to create jobs.""

Tampa Bay Times,AIDS pharmacy and Seventh-day Adventists pick 34th Street S sites,"ST. PETERSBURG — As a building began going up at the corner of 34th Street and 26th Avenue S, rumors included that it was a Starbucks, or even an apartment complex.

Further south, work at a long-closed Thai restaurant also drew curiosity. The news is that it is being transformed into a $1.2 million Seventh-day Adventist Church.

As for the site of the imagined Starbucks, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation based in Los Angeles is actually building a $1.6 million pharmacy, health clinic, wellness center and thrift store.

""The idea is a one-stop shop,"" said Imara Canady, spokesman for the organization's Fort Lauderdale office.

The new facility at 3400 26th Ave. S, on the edge of Midtown, will be the organization's first in St. Petersburg. The group operates in 36 countries and has about 50 facilities in 14 states. Nearby locations are in Clearwater and Safety Harbor.

""We really work to be in communities where there is an issue and an unmet need. When you look at the HIV and AIDS epidemic, the South is greatly impacted by this epidemic and various parts of Florida have high infection rates and cases of other STDs,"" Canady said.

""Our motto is providing cutting-edge medicine regardless of one's ability to pay,"" he said, adding that anyone who tests HIV positive can begin getting care within 72 hours.

The difference between his organization's pharmacy and other well known establishments is that ""96 percent of every dollar that is raised goes back into the community,"" he said. Canady also said that having a pharmacy at the same place where someone is receiving care helps to alleviate ""the barriers of getting the medication one may need.""

According to Pinellas County records, the property was bought for $725,000. The new 14,875-square-foot building — across from Amscot Financial and near Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church — is expected to draw a broad clientele with its Out of the Closet thrift store.

The shop also will offer ""free, rapid, one-minute, confidential testing,"" Canady said. ""One of the inhibitors of people getting tested is the high level of stigma and judgment around HIV. Now nobody knows why you're going into a thrift store.""

As in other areas, Canady said the AIDS Healthcare Foundation plans to collaborate with local nonprofits, including faith groups.

About a mile and a half away, the emerging Skyway Marina District will become the new home of All Nations Seventh-day Adventist Church, which sold its 2611 First Ave. N building for $600,000 in December.

The church bought the former Ai-Mei Thai restaurant at 4200 34th St. S for $525,000 and is adding a 1,517-square-foot fellowship hall.

Pastor John Mills, who was born in Jamaica and migrated to the United States in 1992, said the new church will seat 329. It should be complete by the end of the year, he said.

Until then, the congregation is meeting temporarily at Pilgrim Congregational United Church of Christ at 6315 Central Ave.

With an average attendance of 180, church members believe the new location, on a main thoroughfare and with surrounding neighborhoods, offers the perfect opportunity for growth, Mills said.

""We want to reach out to the community as much as we possibly can,"" he said.

Tampa Bay Times,Bondi joins feds in lawsuit to block major health insurance merger,"Attorney General Pam Bondi is joining an effort to block the merger of two of Florida's largest health insurers.

A lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, eight states and Washington, D.C., says that the $37 million deal for Aetna to acquire Humana would hurt competition and increase insurance prices across the country.

It's an odd move for Bondi to join forces with the federal government. Under her leadership as attorney general, the state has joined or filed several lawsuits contesting the Obama administration's immigration policy and Environmental Protection Agency rules.

Last year, she and Gov. Rick Scott sued the federal government over health care funding, claiming the Obama administration was ""coercing"" the state into expanding Medicaid.

""Competition in our health insurance markets is crucial to keeping premiums down and the quality of care up, particularly when it comes to our seniors and other vulnerable populations, the individuals most affected by this proposed acquisition,"" Bondi said in a statement. ""It is important that we do everything we can to preserve competition in these markets.""

In particular, the governments behind the lawsuit say less competition could hurt seniors and low-income families who buy health coverage from the insurance exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act, according to a court filing.

In a joint statement, Aetna and Humana said they would ""vigorously defend the companies' pending merger.""

Florida and the other governments' lawsuit, the companies contend, is incorrect about the merger limiting competition. The merger will increase Medicare options, they said.

The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation approved the sale in February on conditions that Aetna expand access on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and the ""fair treatment"" of people with HIV.",21/07/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"State agencies haven't appealed judge's abortion ruling, won't say if they plan to","A week after U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle blocked controversial new abortion restrictions, the state has not filed an appeal.

The injunction, requested by Planned Parenthood and granted late June 30,prevents two parts of a law signed this spring by Gov. Rick Scott from going into effect.

Spokespeople for the Department of Health and Agency for Health Care Administration -- the two agencies responsible for enforcing the abortion law and named in the Planned Parenthood lawsuit -- won't say whether the state plans to file an appeal later.

""The department is complying with the judge's ruling and is reissuing the contracts that expired on June 30. No services will be interrupted,"" Department of Health spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said in a statement.

Earlier Friday, Gambineri told the Times/Herald that DOH did not plan to file an appeal. She said she misspoke and that information was incorrect.

AHCA spokeswoman Shelisha Coleman said the agency is ""still reviewing the judge’s order.""

Neither DOH nor AHCA has filed an appeal asking the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Hinkle's order.

One part of the law blocked by Hinkle would have prohibited government funds from abortion clinics, including cancer screenings, HIV tests and family planning funded by Medicaid and local governments. That provision led DOH to cancel contracts with Planned Parenthood, which Gambineri says are being re-issued.

The second provision required that state regulators review patient records from half of the approximately 70,000 abortions in the state each year.

In the ruling, Hinkle said he believed Planned Parenthood was likely to be successful in having those provisions ruled unconstitutional.

The injunction is in effect while Planned Parenthood's lawsuit seeking to strike down those portions of the law moves forward. The state could have appealed it, requesting a higher court to overrule Hinkle.

Supporters of the law say it is intended to increase safety in abortion clinics and prevent the state from indirectly subsidizing abortions. But critics say it’s an unnecessary and unconstitutional burden on women’s right to have an abortion.",08/07/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Candidate accused of extortion by ex-opponent drops out of Largo Commission race,"Robert Avery has dealt with extortion accusations and a virtually broke campaign since he entered the race for Largo City Commission Seat 3.

But he stuck it out — until last week. Avery dropped out of the race June 30, leaving two up to bat in the Nov. 8 election: incumbent Curtis Holmes and political newcomer Neil McMullen.

""It's kind of hard to drum up support right now,"" he said in an interview. ""After you've been (dragged) through the mud, it's hard to get back on stage.""

Avery, 31, said he was referring to an extortion accusation brought forth in November by his then-opponent, Aaron Darr, 25.

Darr told police he received an email through his campaign website saying the author had ""nice things the citizens of Largo will be seeing soon"" and for Darr to ""never post anything digitally you wouldn't want your mom or partner to see."" The contact email was listed as [email protected] Officers traced it back to Avery's computer.

Avery has repeatedly denied the charge, despite an interview with police where he agrees with an officer that he's the only one who could've sent the email. He maintained this week that his computer was hacked. The Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office dropped the charge in February.

Still, the accusation hurt his campaign, Avery said. Campaign finance records show he raised only $345 since he filed to run at the end of August. He pointed to the national political climate as a contributing factor to his campaign breakdown.

""This is a year where if there's any hair of doubt, the citizens just don't care,"" Avery said. ""If your name's been attached to any kind of corruption or issues, you're done.""

Avery, who has a background in information technology, said he plans to focus on obtaining his real estate license.

Darr, a prominent advocate for people with HIV and AIDS after his own diagnosis at 17, dropped out of the race in January to throw support behind McMullen, who he said shares his goals for the city.

""My intention of doing this is really for unity to make sure a progressive wins this race and make sure that Curtis Holmes does not get re-elected,"" Darr said at the time.

That leaves Holmes, an insurance agent and commissioner since 2009, and McMullen, a descendant of one of Pinellas County's founding families who runs a consulting business for faith-based and non-profit organizations.

Holmes has raised $8,105 so far, according to campaign finance reports through June. McMullen has raised $1,695 through May. The June filing deadline is Monday.

The candidate qualifying period is from July 29 to Aug. 12. The mayor and Seat 4 are also up for election. The mayor and commissioners serve 4-year terms.",07/07/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"School choice, budget, tax cuts among the new Florida laws that took effect Friday","TALLAHASSEE — Florida legislators passed 279 bills during this year's session three months ago, and 161 of them took effect Friday with the start of the state's fiscal year, affecting school choice, rape kit testing, tax cuts and many more aspects of life in the Sunshine State.

A law redefining when abortions can be performed and preventing state funds from going to an organization that also provides abortions will not take effect as scheduled, after a federal judge issued a temporary injunction late Thursday. The move comes after a Texas law restricting abortions was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Monday.

Here's a roundup of some of the measures taking effect:

Budget: The $82.3 billion budget was passed by a combined vote of 159-1. It includes more than $700 million for school construction and $203.8 million for Everglades restoration.

Tax cuts: Two will benefit most Floridians. Property taxes should drop along with a reduction in local millage rates, and a three-day sales tax holiday Aug. 5-7 should help back-to-school shoppers. Other highlights include a permanent sales tax exemption for manufacturing equipment and machinery, beverage tax reductions on pear cider and a drop in the tax rate on aviation fuel.

Bullying: School districts must review their antibullying and harassment policies every three years, and integrate rules on dating violence and abuse into discipline policies.

Crime and punishment: Those convicted of aggravated assault or attempted aggravated assault are no longer subject to ""10-20-Life"" mandatory minimum sentences.

Digital assets: Guardians or trustees of estates gain legal authority to manage digital assets and electronic communications as they would tangible assets and financial accounts. Digital companies are provided legal authority to interact with these representatives, revealing such things as passwords to accounts.

Festivals: Any food contests or cookoffs lasting no more than three days and hosted by a school, church, religious organization or nonprofit will not be defined as ""public food service establishments."" That means they don't have to pay licensing fees or are subject to an inspection by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants.

Jury duty: Individuals permanently incapable of caring for themselves may request a permanent exemption from jury duty by submitting a written statement from a doctor verifying the disability.

Marriage: Clergy with religious objections don't have to marry same-sex couples.

Needle exchange: The Miami-Dade Infectious Disease Elimination Act, or IDEA, provides for the University of Miami and affiliates to establish a pilot needle exchange program to prevent the spread of blood-borne diseases such as HIV, AIDS or viral hepatitis in the county, which has the nation's highest rate of new HIV cases.

Outdoors: Fines for illegally killing, taking or selling game or fur-bearing animals while committing burglary or trespass increase from $250 to $500. It becomes a third-degree felony to knowingly possess marine turtles or their eggs or nests.

Public records: Recorded matches regulated by the Florida Boxing Commission may be kept private until they are aired in an exemption requested by Ultimate Fighting Championship for its Ultimate Fighter reality show when it is taped in South Florida.

Tampa Bay Times,Saturday's letters: NRA supports responsible gun ownership,"Portrait of legal gun owner | June 26, letter

NRA's leading role in gun safety

I was appalled that the letter writer named the National Rifle Association as a terrorist enabler and co-conspirator. First of all, the NRA does not issue concealed weapons permits. The Florida permit is issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Licensing, in Tallahassee. The application is a lengthy process with fingerprinting for background checks, a photo ID and an application that takes about 60 to 90 days for approval. The Division of Licensing issues licenses for security guards, firearms instructors and open carry for security work such as armored car and bank guards.

The NRA is the oldest civil rights organization, established in 1871. It offers superior firearm and safety instruction, exceeding the Florida training requirements for a concealed weapons permit. The FBI investigated Orlando gunman Omar Mateen on several occasions with regards to terrorist involvement, but eventually dropped the investigation.

The NRA will fight for the right of the people to keep and bear arms as stated in the Second Amendment.

Attack on women's rights costly | June 21, editorial

Health problems neglected

Thanks to the Times for this editorial describing the governor and state Legislature's unseemly vendetta against gynecological health care for the many uninsured and underinsured women in Florida.

The public money diverted and effort wasted by the Agency for Health Care Administration's deliberate misreading of four Planned Parenthood clinic's records is just the latest cost incurred. Gov. Rick Scott and our Legislature would now like to add the preventable costs of neglected medical problems and unplanned pregnancy to the state's health care costs by withholding all public funds from Planned Parenthood clinics and any other gynecological clinic that also offers abortion.

Planned Parenthood's primary clinical effort is directed to helping women stay healthy, as well as control their fertility. The goal is to conceive only when they and their partners are ready to support a new child, i.e., to avoid all need for abortion, and to avoid cervical, uterine, ovarian and breast cancer and sexually transmitted infections.

We are talking about patient education, effective and affordable birth control, Pap smears, mammograms, testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis and HPV, and regular pelvic examination.

There are not enough clinics for low-income uninsured women in Florida as it is: I volunteer with many others in two free clinics and I can tell you business is booming. Unfortunately, many women come to us with advanced problems that could have been prevented with accessible preventive care.

The money Scott and the Legislature said they were saving the state by declining the funds to expand Medicaid was theoretical. The cost to Florida and the personal suffering of uncared for women by this irresponsible use of political power is real.

20 dead in W. Va. floods | June 25

Floods merited bigger play

With great interest, eager anticipation and some anxiety, I searched through all of last Sunday's edition of my beloved Times hoping to find comprehensive coverage of the deadly, terrible and devastating rain and flood disaster that had been visited upon my home state of West Virginia.

My eager anticipation led me to the front page. I then quickly scanned the main section of the paper, looking for pictures of the devastation. Nope! Hopes sagging, I finally located on page 2A a somewhat short article on the flooding, right next to an article and picture of a Donald Trump golf resort tour that had been on national news for days.

Then, way back on page 9C (sports), I discovered one paragraph regarding the PGA golf tournament that had to be canceled due to flooding at the world-famous Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, one of the little towns that was hardest hit.

My original interest and anticipation soon turned into an almost overwhelming sadness, and even hurt, as I thought about so many of my fellow West Virginians in so many of those little towns, wondering just how much they might have lost, including their very lives.

Payback sought for seized Cuban assets June 27

Cuba has suffered too

This article on two families who are joining other Americans in fighting for lost property in Cuba also raises the reverse demand for compensation that Cuba is directing at the United States.

The U.S. economic embargo imposed on Cuba over the past 50 years has denied billions of dollars to the Cuban economy and placed great hardships on the Cuban people's physical, emotional and mental well-being. Most Cubans have had to earn meager salaries due to America's unfair and politically motivated harsh sanctions and economic penalties.

In addition, our government financially supported the actions of right-wing Cuban nationals — who fit the definition of terrorists today — in a land invasion, airplane attacks and the bombing of a commercial airline that cost 78 Cuban lives.

Domestically, Cuban-Americans in Florida blackballed American entertainers who spoke out against the U.S. embargo, thereby denying U.S. citizens their basic freedoms of speech and right to earn a decent living.

Will the American government pay back these legitimate claims also, or will they allow American entertainers to sue the Cuban-Americans in Miami who discriminated against American citizens and murdered innocent people for ideological, selfish and immoral ends?

Tampa Bay Times,Judge blocks parts of abortion law hours before it goes into effect,"TALLAHASSEE — A federal judge late Thursday night blocked parts of a controversial law that would have eliminated taxpayer funding of preventive care at abortion clinics and required the state to inspect patient records of as many as 35,000 women.

U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle sided with Planned Parenthood when he ordered the state to restore contracts with abortion clinics and to halt plans to inspect abortion records for half of the more than 70,000 patients a year who have the procedure done in Florida.

The injunction came down just hours before the law was supposed to go into effect on Friday. It simply blocks these parts of the law while the lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood is argued or unless a higher court overturns his decision.

In the injunction, Hinkle wrote that he expects the defunding and record inspection provisions will likely be found to be unconstitutional.

Backstory: The three provisions of Florida's abortion law challenged by Planned Parenthood

State health officials named in the lawsuit have not appealed the injunction to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Officials with the Florida Department of Health and Agency for Health Care Administration both said they were ""reviewing"" Hinkle's order.

Planned Parenthood lauded the decision. The group is now trying to renew contracts with county health departments and local governments to provide services using tax dollars.

The contracts — which include HIV testing, cancer screening and education programs — expired Thursday when the state fiscal year ended. Because of the new abortion law, they could not be renewed.

""We are calling our local contacts and asking that they renew our contracts,"" said Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates. ""They expired the 30th, so that's why we're working to renew them quickly.""

Hinkle's ruling instructs the state not to cancel any of the alternative arrangements it made to replace services provided by Planned Parenthood. Dr. Douglas Stein, a Tampa urologist, still plans to provide vasectomies for the health departments in Orange and Sarasota counties.

Tim O'Connor, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Health Department, said four of its clinics will extend hours to provide family planning services for teenagers.

Other county health departments impacted by the changes could not be reached or declined comment.

State health department officials did not comment on the impact of potential contract changes.

Hinkle's decision was not a surprise.

In court Wednesday, Hinkle raised concerns about both of the provisions he blocked.

Under the law, signed by Gov. Rick Scott this spring, no state money can be used for non-abortion care at abortion clinics. Planned Parenthood said it stands to lose $500,000 in state money as a result.

Hinkle's ruling says that portion of the law essentially discourages clinics from performing abortions, which he said is unconstitutional.

""You can't defund based on exercising a constitutional right,"" he said Wednesday.

He also instructs Planned Parenthood to set aside a $5,000 security within a week.

Hinkle further ruled that the state is justified to inspect health records but doesn't have reason to check half of all patient records.

Hinkle, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton in 1996, did not block new definitions of the trimesters of a pregnancy, which Planned Parenthood challenged, but which he said were resolved by the state's lawyers in court.

Other parts of the law went into effect, including a requirement that abortion doctors obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital or abortion clinics have transfer agreements in place.

There are no known abortion clinics expected to shut down in the state as a result.

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Lift blood donation ban on gay men,"The ban on gay men donating blood dates back to the Reagan administration — and the height of the nation's AIDS epidemic. The Food and Drug Administration amended the lifetime ban last year, enabling gay and bisexual men to donate blood if they have been celibate for a year. But even that update seems outdated today, when the blood supply is safe because of tight standards that ensure every pint is screened for infectious diseases. It's worth considering lifting the ban entirely.

The issue has come to the forefront since the June 12 shooting in an Orlando gay nightclub that killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. Thousands lined up to donate blood throughout Florida. Since 1983, men who have had sex with other men, women who have had sex with gay men and transgender people have been banned from donating because they were deemed high-risk for transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Last year's change — supported by the American Medical Association — was a significant shift in FDA policy but still excluded many people from donating. That exclusion was keenly felt in the wake of the Orlando massacre.

HIV/AIDS remains a serious public health concern — indeed, Florida leads the nation in new infections. The FDA says the 12-month ban helps prevent the spread of HIV. But the virus that began its spread through the gay community in the 1980s now affects every demographic. Barring blood donations from gay men doesn't make the blood supply safer, and including them won't put it at greater risk.

Potential blood donors are asked questions about their sexual history and drug use before they are allowed to donate. Anyone who has had numerous sexual partners or used intravenous drugs is at greater risk of contracting and spreading blood-borne diseases. But again, those behavioral factors cross all demographics. Plus, anyone can answer the questions falsely. The only true safeguards are laboratory tests that screen for AIDS as well as hepatitis, syphilis and other diseases.

Banning gay men from donating blood is a misplaced policy that singles out sexual orientation instead of the primary risk factor, which is behavior. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, and more than 100 other members of Congress have started a worthwhile conversation about changing the FDA's policy. Lifting the ban could provide an opportunity for millions more Americans to safely contribute to the country's blood supply.",01/07/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Judge blocks parts of abortion law hours before it goes into effect,"A federal judge late Thursday night blocked parts of a controversial abortion law within hours of it going into effect.

The injunction, written by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle, orders the state to maintain contracts for preventive care with abortion clinics including Planned Parenthood and prevents a new rule that would require 50 percent of all abortion clinic records to be reviewed by the state each year.

Hinkle's ruling simply blocks these parts of the law from going into effect while the case is argued or unless a higher court overturns his decision. He wrote in the opinion that he expects the defunding and record inspection provisions will likely be ruled unconstitional.

Backstory: The three provisions of Florida's abortion law challenged by Planned Parenthood

Attorney General Pam Bondi's office could not be immediately reached Thursday night for comment on whether it planned to appeal the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Leaders with Planned Parenthood, which sued the state over the law, said in written statements that they were pleased with the decision.

""Today’s ruling should be hailed by all Floridians, but especially the thousands of men and women across the state who would have been cut off from access to reproductive health care including cancer screenings, birth control, STD testing and more had HB 1411 been allowed to stand,"" said Barbara Zdravecky, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida.

This is not an entirely unexpected outcome.

In court Wednesday, Hinkle raised concerns about both of the provisions he blocked.

Under the law, signed by Gov. Rick Scott this spring, no state money can be used for non-abortion care -- services like cancer screenings, HIV tests or education programs -- at abortion clinics. Planned Parenthood said it stands to lose $500,000 in state money as a result.

Hinkle's ruling says that portion of the law essentially discourages clinics from performing abortions, which he said is unconstitutional.

""You can't defund based on exercising a constitutional right,"" he said Wednesday.

It's unclear what effect there might be on state health care contracts. But Hinkle instructed the state not to cancel any alternate contracts it has struck and told it not to cancel those held by abortion clinics.

He also instructs Planned Parenthood to set aside a $5,000 security within a week.

Hinkle further ruled the requirement that half of aboriton records be checked by state regulators was high. He made clear that the state is justified in inspecting health records but said it hasn't shown any justification for such a large volume.

Hinkle, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton in 1996, did not block new definitions of the trimesters of a pregnancy, which Planned Parenthood challenged, but which he said were resolved by the state's lawyers in court.

Tampa Bay Times,Federal judge could block Florida's abortion law,"TALLAHASSEE — A federal judge this week could block parts of a new law that restricts abortion clinics in Florida.

Lawyers for Planned Parenthood, which sued two state agencies over the law, argued their case Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee.

At issue are three provisions of the legislation signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott this spring:

• Blocking all taxpayer money for nonabortion services to abortion providers. These programs total $500,000, according to Planned Parenthood, and include Medicaid funds for preventive services like cancer screenings and HIV testing, as well as a teen dropout program in Palm Beach County.

• Requiring that half of all abortion records in the state — likely at least 30,000 cases — be inspected every year by state regulators.

• Defining the trimesters of a pregnancy, which Planned Parenthood says could limit some of their clinics by shortening the time period when they are allowed to provide abortions. Deputy Solicitor General Denise Harle said the Agency for Health Care Administration does not interpret the law in that way.

Unless Hinkle intervenes, the omnibus changes will go into effect Friday.

Arguing on behalf of the state, Harle said blocking the law would be an extraordinary move because it does not appear on its face to be unconstitutional. States are allowed to regulate abortions as long as they don't create extraordinary obstacles to obtain them.

""The state's not attempting to prevent (Planned Parenthood) from providing abortions,"" she said.

Hinkle did not immediately rule, but he raised concerns that the state might indirectly discourage clinics from providing abortions by pulling funding from other programs.

""You can't defund based on exercising a constitutional right,"" he said.

State and federal money already cannot be used for abortions.

Hinkle's decision, expected this week, will relate only to an injunction that could block the law from going into effect, not determine its constitutionality.

Carrie Flaxman, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood, said the law essentially forces the group to cut back services — or stop providing abortions, which it does not intend to do.

""Defunding will require the plaintiffs to end these programs, close the health center and reduce staff,"" she said. ""Targeting abortions is not a legitimate interest in doing so.""

Cuts in government funding — though small compared to the approximately $22 million Planned Parenthood spent last year in Florida — could impact 15,000 patients across the state, the group says. But Harle said state agencies have already found new health providers to work with if the law goes into effect Friday.

Hinkle, appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1996, raised further concerns about the heightened volume of patient records that state inspectors would need to review under the law. Planned Parenthood contends that it's a more onerous standard than other kinds of health facilities face and that it would violate patients' privacy.

But the state argues it needs to closely monitor abortion clinics to ensure they follow a number of laws passed in recent years ""enhancing women's health and safety"" at the facilities, Harle said.

Planned Parenthood's lawyers expect those assertions will be closely scrutinized, especially in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday that struck down abortion restrictions in Texas. In the ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that courts should weigh the medical benefits of abortion rules, rather than taking state legislatures at their word when they say health and safety are their primary goal.

""These are medically unnecessary restrictions,"" said Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.

An additional provision of the new Florida law not currently challenged by Planned Parenthood requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital or for clinics to have a transfer agreement. Flaxman said the group is weighing its options in light of the Supreme Court decision, which ruled a similar Texas provision unconstitutional.

Tampa Bay Times,Romano: Florida's abortion con artists put on notice by Supreme Court,"The full Supreme Court ruling on a Texas abortion case is now available online in 107 pages filled with formal language and meticulous detail.

The shorthand version reads something like this:

Texas lied.

When legislators in the Lone Star State said they were trying to make the world safer and better for women seeking abortions, they were actually doing the opposite.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a concurring opinion, went so far as to warn other states that the court will not look kindly on similar abortion laws built on bogus health claims.

And why is Ginsburg's brief interjection important?

Because Florida lied, too.

State legislators have been slowly dancing around the edges of Roe vs. Wade for several years, passing bills they say benefit women but clearly appear to be politically motivated.

A law requiring a 24-hour waiting period was temporarily suspended by the Florida Supreme Court in April, and a challenge to another law that changes the definition of a pregnancy's first trimester, along with other provisions, will be heard in a district court Wednesday.

And you might want to pay attention to that case.

Because, if the courts don't intervene, Florida will continue to see more laws that make it increasingly difficult to obtain an abortion. That might not sound like a bad thing to someone opposed to abortion, but these laws also include a lot of collateral damage.

For example, a bill signed earlier this year by Gov. Rick Scott restricts state funding for clinics that provide abortions. Since the state already had a law banning funding for the actual abortion, this new law would basically eliminate funding for procedures like cancer screenings, vasectomies or HIV tests.

Who could possibly think that's a good idea?

Apparently, most of the state Senate and House who voted for the bill, including every GOP lawmaker around here.

Essentially what they're doing is playing a glorified shell game. Politicians distract your attention with dubious claims, and then slip in an unnecessarily restrictive law.

What the Supreme Court ruled in the Texas case was the arguments for oversight were vastly overblown, and the practical realities were extremely chilling.

""Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to … (hospital) requirements,'' Ginsburg wrote. ""When a state severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners.''

The Florida laws are similar in spirit, but not identical to the Texas laws swatted aside by the Supreme Court on Monday. That means the Florida laws are in serious trouble, but not necessarily doomed.

Justices cited statistics showing that half the abortion clinics in Texas were forced to shut down because of the laws, leading to overcrowding, delays and lengthy commutes for women in rural communities. Basically, the laws led to more dangerous conditions.

Since Florida laws have yet to go into effect, it may be more difficult to prove they will have the opposite effect of their supposed intentions.

""The Texas clinics were decimated, so it was a pretty easy case from the standpoint of creating an undue burden on women,"" said Stetson University law professor Louis Virelli. ""If you had asked me what was the best-case scenario for the clinics in Florida, it would have been this exact decision.

""But something to keep an eye on is that variable of meeting the standard of an undue burden.""

It's up to judges to parse the constitutionality and ramifications of the laws passed in the Legislature. It's up to you and me to decide whether the politicians we send to represent us in Tallahassee are being honest and sincere.

In this case, I have no problem saying Florida lied.",27/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"After Orlando shooting, a renewed purpose for St. Pete Pride","ST. PETERSBURG — Awash in rainbow body paint and dancing to thumping music, thousands celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage at last year's St. Pete Pride.

This year, two weeks after a mass shooting at an Orlando gay club, the mood of the festival will inevitably shift to a more somber tone reminiscent of the first Pride events spawned from violence against the LGBT community nearly 50 years ago, organizers and participants said.

More, not less, are expected to attend this weekend's events. Organizers expect a record attendance of more than 250,000 as the shooting inspires a renewed sense of urgency to band together and enact change.

""People are being murdered,"" said Susan McGrath, president of the Stonewall Democrats of Pinellas County. ""As much as we appreciate and we celebrate marriage equality, the fact that people are still losing their lives in such a violent attack on our community means that there's just as much work to do as there ever was.""

The first Pride events came after riots involving police officers and LGBT patrons of the Stonewall Inn in New York City in 1969. Unlike the colorful and lively parades that are characteristic of Pride celebrations today, these earlier affairs started as vigils and marches, said Eric Skains, St. Pete Pride's executive director.

This weekend's festival will still go as planned with the parade starting at sunset Saturday. But it will begin with 10 seconds of silence for the 49 people killed and 53 hurt at Pulse — a total of 17 minutes.

It represents a return to the original purpose of Pride, Skains said.

""We're remembering and walking in solidarity for people who have either had enough with how they're being treated or people who have lost their lives,"" he said.

Organizers worked with several law enforcement agencies to increase security during the parade. There will also be counselors available from Metro Health, Wellness and Community and the American Red Cross, Skains said.

The need for counseling became apparent at Tampa Bay Rays Pride Night last week, said Lorraine Langlois, CEO of Metro Wellness. The group parked its community mobile health unit at the game for HIV testing. But instead of coming in for a test, several people stopped by to talk about how they were coping with the shooting, she said. At Pride, counselors will be available in the LGBT Welcome Center at 2227 Central Ave.

""Certainly, it will be on the minds of people,"" Langlois said. ""I think it's going to be bittersweet. We are united, won't be threatened, we're not going away. I think there is that connection among all of us.""

To Brian Longstreth, a founder of St. Pete Pride, the mood will spark a political response. When St. Pete Pride started in 2003, it was characterized as a promenade, which Longstreth said was halfway between a march and a parade. It emphasized grass roots politics.

Since the shooting, Longstreth said he's noticed more people willing to engage in conversations about, say, gun legislation, rather than avoiding them out of frustration that their voices go unheard.

""Now, I think the feeling is you have to make a difference,"" he said. ""There's such a stalemate in politics to get anything done, sometimes it takes an act like this to get people to really move forward.""

The key, both he and McGrath said, will be to keep up the momentum through November's election.

""The greatest place we stand together is to vote,"" McGrath said. ""Stay involved, have conversations with legislators, look at what kind of policy is being discussed in Tallahassee.""

For some, that need for action has overpowered initial responses of fear. Miguel Fuller spent the hours after the shooting covering it for Hot 101.5, the radio station where he hosts a show, and questioning whether he should back out of serving as a grand marshal for the parade.

""All of a sudden the place you felt the most safe and most secure is compromised,"" he said of Pulse. ""In the process of talking about it on the air, off the air, I thought, 'Oh god what does this mean for Pride?'""

But as he was encouraging a woman who called in saying she was afraid to take her son to a concert in Orlando, he realized he had to take his own advice.

In the days since, reactions from people around him have only strengthened his decision to stay in the parade, he said. Out of the fear came compassion, which Fuller thinks will resonate this weekend.

""People saw and sort of felt the fear that we feel as gay people,"" he said. ""They understand why we celebrate Pride and why we want to spread this message of love and acceptance and being yourself.""

Tampa Bay Times,Poe: The LGBT community can move the needle on gun laws,"Democratic congressional candidate and former state Democratic Party Chairman Bob Poe attended the vigil in Orlando late Monday to remember the 50 people killed in a massacre in a gay night club.

""It’s hard to wrap my mind around it,"" Poe said. ""You never think that something like this would happen in Orlando. It’s unimaginable.""

Last week, Poe announced he is HIV-positive. He said he hoped to bring awareness to those living with the illness.

Now, in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, he said he had another cause to champion.

""One of the thoughts that is occurring to me, (is that) we’ve seen the political power that the LGBT community has had over the years, how it moved the needle very quickly on its own civil rights, DOMA, marriage equality,"" he said. ""I’m wondering if, what good can come out of this, is that we can be the catalyst that finally moves the needle on sensible gun safety (laws) and assault-weapons bans. If we galvanize our community, can we move it forward?""

Poe pointed out that the LGBT community stretches acros the country.

""We’re used to activism,"" he said. ""We know how to operate in the political arena. We know how to get things done. Can we channel that into this effort now?""

Poe is optimistic.

""The people at Sandy Hook apparently couldn’t do it. The people in Aurora couldn’t do it. The people in Charleston couldn’t do it. But can the LGBT community at large around this country, could we do it? The answer is yes, we could.""",14/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"In Orlando, visitors to the 'Happiest Place On Earth' confront a sad reality  but keep coming","ORLANDO — Coloradans Randy and Tammy Harris had been planning the trip for 10 months. Seven-year-old son Jackson had his heart set on Space Mountain; his 4-year-old sister, Anabelle, was hoping to meet her namesake from Beauty and the Beast.

They'd come to experience what's billed as the ""Happiest Place on Earth."" And then, just a few miles away, there was another superlative: The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

The Harrises are certainly not insensitive to tragedy. They live in Aurora, Colorado, where a man dressed in black body armor rampaged through a movie theater in July 2012, killing 12 and wounding 70 others.

""There is no place that's completely safe anymore,"" said Tammy Harris, a middle school writing teacher. ""Absolutely no place. These things happen in theaters, in schools, etc. It is just pervasive, unfortunately.""

Sunday's massacre at Pulse Night Club in downtown Orlando was another reminder. That's what she'll think about as she remembers this trip, she said as she slathered her daughter with sunscreen in the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. ""Unfortunately, it's just becoming a bit of the norm now where these tragedies happen.""

Though they didn't know anyone killed or wounded in the Aurora shootings, as members of the community, they felt the effect.

Randy Harris said it takes time to absorb what happens in mass shootings. And for ""people from Orlando, maybe even a year from now, would give more insight.""

From all over the world, people come to central Florida's theme parks to enjoy themselves and to escape from reality, if just for a few hours.

But around 2 a.m. Sunday, police say, Omar Mateen entered the Pulse club, a gay venue, with a rifle and pistol and opened fire. When the shooting was over, Mateen and 49 others were dead, and 53 more were wounded.

Like any other major U.S. city, Orlando is no stranger to violence.

In December, leaders created the City of Orlando Nightclubs Task Force to study the sometimes unruly crowds spilling from its venues. Two months later, two people died and 10 were injured when a gang feud erupted in shooting at another nightclub packed with 300 patrons.

Not long before the Pulse incident, 22-year-old singer Christina Grimmie, a former contestant on NBC's The Voice, was shot dead while signing autographs. The shooter then killed himself.

But to people around the world, Orlando represents America at its most fun. In 2015, a record 66 million people visited Orlando, making it the most visited tourist destination in the U.S.

Laura Hakami of Norton, England, said her family had saved three years for their dream vacation to the Magic Kingdom. They followed the news all day Sunday, but they never even considered not going to Disney World on Monday.

""Oh it's horrible, isn't it?"" Hakami said as her children, Oliver, 7, and Amelia, 5, fidgeted by the car. ""But I think our good memories will still stand out more than what happened.""

Despite the blistering heat Monday morning, Jessica Gunter of Teaneck, N.J., stood in line dressed in an orange and black ""Tigger"" costume. ""He's my favorite character,"" she said of Winnie the Pooh's bouncy buddy. ""I like to go as full Disney as I can.""

But behind her beaming smile and blue-green hair was a faint shadow of guilt. She confessed to worrying that the park might be closed because of the shootings, or that the experience might be somehow changed.

""Not to make it all about us and, 'I don't want our trip to be ruined,'"" she said. ""It's a horrible thing to have happened.""

Even these purveyors of fantasy and magic were not immune.

Luis Vielma, 22, worked at Universal Studios' Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Author J.K. Rowling tweeted a photograph of Vielma wearing a sweater vest and tie of a student at her fictional Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

""I can't stop crying,"" the author wrote.

Whether Mateen's rampage was born or radical Islam, mental illness, anti-gay feelings or some combination of the three remains unclear. But Orlando has wrapped its arms around the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

Sunday night, the Orlando Eye — the Florida city's answer to London's Thames-side Ferris wheel — was bathed in rainbow light in honor of the Pulse victims. Inside, security guards passed wands over visitors, a new measure in reaction to the shootings.

Ray and Cecile Berthiaume wondered if it was the right time to be out enjoying themselves. But their 10-year-old grandson, Will, was visiting from Connecticut, and they wanted to let him ride the Eye and experience Disney World.

""We're going to go into our own world tomorrow and forget about it for a few moments — and maybe a few hours,"" Ray Berthiaume said.

""You can't dwell on it,"" his wife agreed. ""Because, if you do, you'd never have any life at all. You'd have nothing.""

At the GLBT Community Center of Central Florida, a few blocks from Pulse, volunteers loaded a truck with pallets of water and other donations for their grieving extended family. Out front, the U.S. and rainbow flags flew at half-staff and a handwritten sign on the front door warned visitors, ""Please be prepared to open your bags + purse.""

Volunteer Elizabeth Jennings, dressed in rainbow pants, squatted in the grass out back as she helped wrap roses and lilies for distribution to the mourning. The miracle to her was that Orlando had been spared such tragedy for so long.

""These things are happening, like, once a day, it seems like,"" she said. ""So if you put it in that perspective, then you can't really ever celebrate, because someone's getting killed somewhere.""

Inside, a harried-looking Russell Walker worked to marshal volunteers and field media inquiries.

Walker, community development director for the Hope and Help Center, which provides services for people with HIV/AIDS, said it is difficult dealing with such sadness in ""such a happy town."" He says that notion of this being the world's happiest place ""seems lost right now.""

But he is confident that sense of joy will return someday.

""I know it's something I personally look forward to being able to say again,"" he said. ""Without the pangs coming when you say that kind of thing.""",14/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Tampa Bay LGBT community struggles to make sense of Orlando massacre,"Shock, fear and sadness from Sunday morning's mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest in U.S. history, could be felt throughout Tampa Bay.

Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community worked through a rainy morning and afternoon to make sense of the tragedy.

With St. Petersburg Pride weekend only two weeks away, security loomed as chief concern.

St. Pete Pride executive director Eric Skains said security has been tightened at the weekendlong event, which draws up to 100,000 people annually, ever since the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013. Pride events are scheduled from June 22-26 throughout downtown St. Petersburg.

There will be a visible security presence at Pride as well as plain-clothes officers, Skains said. Officials with the event are also reaching out to Orlando Pride to invite them to attend and assist in a moment of recognition for the lives lost in the shooting.

St. Pete Pride won't be derailed by the act of terror, Skains said. Instead, it will bring members of the LGBT community together to support those reeling from the shooting.

""We won't let this deter us from coming together as a community,"" Skains said. ""This isn't the first time there's been a violent act against LGBT people, and hopefully this raises awareness and brings back the purpose of Pride, which is to commemorate all the acts we have overcome. This is a time for us to stand together.""

Carrie West, founding member of Tampa Pride and the GaYBOR District Coalition, spent Sunday morning desperately searching for friends. Some who work for Al and Chuck Travel, an LGBT travel company, were at Pulse on Saturday night and were still missing Sunday.

""We're looking on Facebook, checking local hospitals. We just have nothing right now,"" West said. ""So many people from Tampa go to Orlando on Saturdays, especially for Latin night. We're just totally involved in the sorrow of what's happening. I'm just really, really sad.""

West said Edward Sotomayor, national brand manager for Al and Chuck Travel and a University of South Florida graduate, was shot in the club and underwent surgery at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Orlando police reported later that he was among those who died.

West's partner, Mark Bias, was called in to an early morning meeting at Hamburger Mary's in Ybor City, where he is a bartender, to go over safety precautions and procedures. For now, the club and restaurant plan to open as normal, but the establishment has already received numerous cancelled reservations, West said.

A group from Tampa Pride went to Orlando to see where and how they can help while others have left to donate blood. State law, however, prevents homosexuals from donating blood for fear of HIV/AIDS or other viruses, he said.

""It's still the law of the land we can't give blood,"" West said. ""People are trying to help and they're just eliminating the pool of people and our community needs it.""

""It's really felt on your sleeve, the tears of what happened here,"" West said.

West said the GaYBOR District Coalition and others are working to organize a vigil tonight in Centennial Park. A vigil for victims is also scheduled for 7 tonight at the Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park in downtown Tampa.

Lorraine Langlois, CEO of Metro Wellness and Community Centers, said the organization is accepting monetary donations for the LGBT Center of Central Florida in Orlando. Metro Wellness brought in extra counselors to the LGBT Welcome Center in St. Petersburg on Sunday afternoon to help those affected. It is also accepting snacks to donate to those working in Orlando.

""We'll just have to wait and see. Once the list comes out of who has died and who is in critical condition, then more people will know how they've been affected,"" Langlois said. ""With Pride coming up, it's just a time where we have a lot of crazy people and copycats so we'll just have to see what happens.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Pulse Orlando shooting scene is popular LGBT club where employees, patrons are 'like family'","Pulse Orlando, the gay bar where early Sunday dozens of people were massacred is one of Central Florida's most popular LGBT nightspots, according to several stunned former employees.

""Pulse is like a family. Everybody who works there is treated equally. Treated like brothers and sisters. When somebody is hurting or in need, we always look out for each other,"" said Benjamin Di'Costa, 25, a former Pulse dancer who later lived in Broward County and now works as an HIV counselor in Chicago.

The nightclub, which caters to a younger clientele, is about a half-mile from Orlando's downtown area, Di'Costa said.

""This is one of the No. 1 destinations for LGBT people to attend in the summertime,"" he said. ""Mostly people from Central Florida, some people come from Tampa to Orlando.""

""Very trendy club, mostly younger, different demographics. It's been one of the most popular clubs. They've been around about 10 years,"" he said.

Di'Costa said that on most nights, Pulse would be filled with between 500 and 600 patrons, but that on a ""high capacity"" night like Saturday, up to 800 people might be there.

The shooting happened about closing time, so probably fewer people were still at the club, he said.

""Saturdays are Latin nights, so it's primarily Latinos of all ages,"" he said. ""It's usually a later crowd, so people come closer to the close of the club. They close at 2. It was right at the time of closing, when people are starting to exit.""

The club is usually well-secured, he said.

""Pulse usually hires armed off-duty police officers who stay in the parking lot outside. They have security inside, the bouncers. Trouble before? Not to my knowledge, nothing that involved weapons.""

Alex Choy, a former club employee, also said Pulse's LGBT patrons could be rowdy, but not violent.

""We throw a lot of shade, a lot of attitude, we never throw gun violence,"" said Choy, 33, now a registered nurse at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital at Memorial in Hollywood.

Choy waited for news about friends at Pulse, but Sunday morning after he finished work had still heard nothing.

""A lot of my friends are entertainers at the club. I come from the family of bartenders and DJs and dancers and they all work at Pulse,"" Choy said. ""It's one of the few high-end gay clubs. Orlando doesn't have that many gay clubs. Pulse is one of the high-end ones that offers great entertainers, many from RuPaul's Drag Race.""

Di'Costa and Choy both described Pulse as being a cozy club with two main rooms. Patrons enter and either turn left to a smaller performance space with dancers and drag shows, or right to a larger dance space that connects to an outdoor patio behind the club.

""It's a very, very small space. Either room you go into,"" Choy said. ""If you go to your left, there's a small room with the stage. That's what worries me, if there was any type of shooting, it wouldn't take much to get everyone. Very close range.""

Choy, who grew up in Miami and lived in Orlando from 2001 to 2014, said Pulse's usual patrons were ""really young, really young — 22, 23.""

Everyone there is really close, he said. ""They're the families gay people pick when their own families don't accept them.""

Equality Florida, the state's leading LGBT rights group, on Sunday launched a GoFundMe page with a goal of raising $100,000 for victims of the Pulse Orlando massacre. In less than an hour, 33 people donated $1,695.

Nadine Smith, CEO of Tampa-based Equality Florida, said she happened to be in Orlando on Sunday.

""We are reaching out to local leaders to see how our community can respond,"" Smith said. ""Clubs have been a safe haven. Sometimes the only safe haven in our communities. This strikes at the very heart of us.""

EQUALITY FLORIDA STATEMENT ON SHOOTING

We are reeling from the tragic news that a gunman opened fire on the 2am capacity crowd at Pulse leaving 20 people dead and 42 injured according to preliminary reports.

We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country.

Gay clubs hold a significant place in LGBTQ history. They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety. June commemorates our community standing up to anti-LGBTQ violence at the Stonewall Inn, the nightclub that has become the first LGBTQ site recognized as a national monument.

We have received a steady stream of emails and messages from those seeking to help or to make sense of the senseless. We make no assumptions on motive. We will await the details in tears of sadness and anger. We stand in solidarity and keep our thoughts on all whose lives have been lost or altered forever in this tragedy.

Plans are underway for the following. More details to come.

• A vigil tomorrow pending clearance from police.

• A blood drive: OneBlood, the local blood bank, has posted an emergency need for O-, O+, and AB Plasma.

• A fund is being set up to help victims families.

• Grief counseling is being made available at the community center.",12/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Cultural sensitivities obstacle at U.N. AIDS conference,"UNITED NATIONS — No one at the high-level United Nations conference devoted to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 denies serious scientific and financial challenges remain, but cultural sensitivities may prove the toughest stumbling block on the way to achieving that goal.

A number of gay and transgender groups were excluded from attending the three-day-long conference that began Wednesday by countries who objected to their presence, and nations squabbled over references in a final statement to topics involving gay sex and intravenous drug use.

General Assembly President Mogens Lykketoft conceded that cultural sensitivities complicated negotiations, but he hailed the final result, which calls for countries to reduce the number of new HIV infections to below 500,000 a year by 2020, down from 2.1 million in 2015 and bringing the number of annual AIDS-related deaths to under half a million in 2020 from 1.1 million last year.

""It's obvious that cultural sensitivities have played a very big role in all the difficulties we have met during this process, and of course many of us hope that at the end, the evidence we have of what works, the evidence we have on the necessity to integrate all key populations in the efforts against this epidemic will prevail, but there are different opinions, there are limitations for how long we can come up with a consensus in the whole U.N. family,"" Lykketoft said.

Matthew Kavanagh, senior policy analyst for the anti-AIDS group HealthGap, said he applauded the so-called 90-90-90 treatment target for 2020 whereby 90 percent of people infected with the disease know their HIV status, 90 percent of those who know they are infected are accessing treatment and 90 percent of those receiving treatment have suppressed viral loads.

But Kavanagh said he was disheartened over efforts by countries like Russia, Iran, Poland and several Gulf states who managed to strip language from an earlier draft of the conference's political declaration that would have called for the decriminalization of homosexuality and drug use and urging they be treated instead as human rights issues.

""So there's one reality that bold targets have been set,"" Kavanagh said. ""Then there's this other reality that we will never reach those targets so long as critical populations like men who have sex with men are criminalized and stigmatized, because when they are they can't and won't access treatment.""

Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS, recognized the complexity of the issue but added that he felt the declaration was something to be proud of.

""I think anything linked to sexuality is very complex. Is it about taboo? Is it about norms? Is it about the position of people in the society? It's about so many factors, cultural factors, economic factors. That's why AIDS is so complex,"" Sidibé said.

But Sidibé said those opinions could also change over time.

He cited China, which long promoted zero tolerance for drug injectors until UNAIDS was able to demonstrate that the policy was not effective. The Chinese government then embarked on the world's biggest harm reduction program, Sidibé said.",09/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Victims speak out Malawi sees surge in attacks on albinos,"LILONGWE, Malawi — She is haunted daily by the image of the decapitated head of her 9-year-old son. Police asked Edna Cedrick to identify it after the boy, who had albinism, was snatched from her arms in a violent struggle.

The death in February was one in a recent surge in killings and abductions of people with albinism in this southern African country. They are targeted for their body parts, which are sold to be used in potions made by witch doctors who claim they bring wealth and good luck.

At least 18 albino people have been killed in Malawi in a ""steep upsurge in killings"" since November 2014, and five others have been abducted and remain missing, according to a new Amnesty International report released Tuesday. The toll is likely much higher because many killings in rural areas are never reported, according to the report. Malawi police also have recorded cases where the bodies of people with albinism have been illegally exhumed.

Malawian police say the growing violence comes after neighboring Tanzania imposed tough measures against such trade in January 2015. The United Nations has reported several killings of albinos in Burundi in recent years as well.

Cedrick, the mother of the murdered boy, recounted his abduction to the Associated Press last month while holding the murdered boy's surviving twin brother, who also has albinism. In the middle of the night, she said, she woke to the sound of people kicking down the door of the house. Her husband was away.

""Before I could understand what was happening, they sliced the mosquito net and grabbed one of the twins,"" the 26-year-old said, tears in her eyes. ""I held on to him by holding his waist, at the same time shielding the other with my back.""

When they could not overpower her, one assailant hacked her in the forehead with a machete, she said. ""This dazed me, and I lost hold of my son and he was gone. I shouted for help, but when my relatives rushed to our house, they were gone.""

The boy's twin keeps asking where his brother is, she said. She lies, saying he will return.

On the same day of the interview, a deadly attack was carried out in another part of Malawi on 38 year-old Fletcher Masina, an albino father of four. When his body was found, the limbs were missing.

""The macabre trade is also fueled by a belief that bones of people with albinism contain gold,"" the rights group says, noting another mistaken belief is that sex with a person with albinism can cure HIV. The report also points out widespread discrimination against people with albinism, including by family members.

Activists in Malawi recently took to the streets to protest, marching to parliament to present a petition calling for strict penalties for people who attack or kill people with albinism. President Peter Mutharika has since established a committee to look into the issue, which he called disgusting.

""That anybody could think that you can be rich by using bones or something like that because some witch doctors have said so. . . . That's stupidity,"" he told a political rally on June 1.

Police concede that a lack of security has caused persons with albinism, and their parents, to live in fear of attack.

""In rural areas where these attacks are rampant, we do not have enough police officers,"" the officer in charge in Machinga district, Isaac Maluwa, said.

When an AP crew in Machinga district stopped to talk to a man riding a bicycle and carrying a 3-year-old albino boy, he charged at the crew with a knife.

The man, 31-year-old Razik Jaffalie, later explained that he is in dire straits after giving up his work as a bicycle taxi operator to protect his son.

""My life has come to a standstill,"" Jaffalie said, then declared: ""Anyone who will come to try to snatch my child from me will have to kill me first.""

Amid the fears, there are stories of optimism. Mina Godfrey, a 13-year-old girl with albinism in Machinga district, said she placed first in her latest school exams and hopes to become a lawyer. But this comes after she survived being abducted from her bed at night by her uncle.

""I was deep in sleep when next thing I realized was that I was outside the house, naked, while heavy rains pouring down on me,"" she said. ""When I screamed, my uncle grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and I choked.""

She tried to flee but was tied to a bicycle that her attackers used to transport her.

""But when we went to the next stop, they untied me to negotiate with the buyer and started discussing before moving away a little bit, giving me an opportunity to run away again,"" she said. She escaped to a nearby house, where she squatted until the owner found her in the morning.

Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for southern Africa, concluded: ""The time has come for the government of Malawi to stop burying its head in the sand and pretending that this problem will just go away.""",08/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Planned Parenthood sues state of Florida over abortion law,"Planned Parenthood on Thursday sued the state of Florida over a controversial abortion law that would cut off state Medicaid money for non-abortion services from their clinics.

The suit alleges that the law, signed by Gov. Rick Scott on March 25, was intended to ""punish, harass, and stigmatize the state’s abortion providers for their and their patients’ exercise of constitutional rights.""

It's unconstitutional, Planned Parenthood's lawyers write, for the state to block funding for programs like HIV testing and breast cancer screenings from certain types of providers. The lawsuit also challenges new definitions of the trimesters of a pregnancy, calling them medically invalid. The trimester provision stems from a legal battle late last fall between the state and Planned Parenthood.

The suit asks the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee to rule those provisions unconstitutional and prevent the law from going into effect as scheduled on July 1.

The Department of Health, which is named in the suit, is ""reviewing the lawsuit,"" spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said.

During heated debates in the legislative session, Sen. Kelli Stargel and Rep. Colleen Burton, both Republicans of Lakeland, said the law would protect women's health, but it was widely taken by Democrats and abortion-rights supporters as an attack on clinics.",03/06/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Rick Scott silent on other surgeon general applicants,"Last week, Gov. Rick Scott announced interim state surgeon general Dr. Celeste Philip would take on the job full-time, but he and his office won't say whether they sought other applications for the job.

Asked whether he considered other candidates, Scott did not directly answer the question in a conversation with reporters Tuesday.

""Dr. Phillips has done a great job at the Department of Health, and she did a great job there while John Armstrong was there,"" Scott said. ""And so I appointed her the interim when John left, and she's done a great job.""

The Times/Herald asked his spokespeople the same question last week, and they have not responded with an answer.

Scott can hire anyone who meets basic requirements -- like being a medical doctor with public health experience -- as surgeon general and secretary of DOH, and there is no public component of the hiring process. The Senate has final confirmation authority and must act on Philip's appointment by the end of the 2018 legislativsession.

Philip was an internal hire, previously the deputy secretary of health responsible for Children's Medical Services, as well as HIV and other communicable diseases -- both areas about which senators raised questions in Armstrong's confirmation hearings.

She became interim surgeon general March 11 at the end of the legislative session after Armstrong was not confirmed for the job, and she was acting surgeon general last fall when Armstrong took time off to undergo treatment for colon cancer.

Tampa Bay Times,Hillsborough homeless count drops nearly 6 percent from 2015,"The total number of homeless people in Hillsborough County dropped nearly 6 percent to 1,817 since last year, according to the county’s annual count of individuals and families on the street or in shelters.

To do the count, the Tampa Hillsborough Homeless Initiative had 330 volunteers fan out across the county, covering streets, alleys, spaces under bridges, wooded campsites and soup kitchens between 5:30 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 25.

Of those counted, 62 percent were men or boys, 38 percent women or girls. Nineteen percent were younger than 18, while 7 percent were older than 60. Nearly a third said they had been homeless for at least a year, and more than half said they were homeless because they lacked a job or had financial problems.

""If I had the money, I’d buy a house,"" 30-year-old Jon Lloyd told a reporter on the day of the count. ""But at my income level now, I’m better off buying a toothbrush and shampoo and washing up over there,"" pointing to a spigot near Church Park in Town 'N' Country.

The count also found that:

• 181 of the homeless counted were veterans. That’s down 42 percent from the 2015 count, though the number could be higher because 627 of those counted refused to answer the question.

• 247 were chronically homeless, down 19 percent. Someone is considered chronically homeless if he or she has a disabling condition and has been homeless for at least a year or has been homeless four or more times in a three-year period.

• 280 suffered from mental illness, down 4 percent.

• 335 had problems with substance abuse, up 64 percent.

• 134 were victims of domestic violence, down 38 percent.

• 25 had HIV or AIDS, down nearly 32 percent.

Breaking down the total, 769 had no shelter, 631 had some sort of emergency shelter, and 407 were in transitional housing.

But the number in transitional housing — short-term accommodations that keep at-risk individuals and families off the street while efforts are made to find them a permanent home — is expected to fall by more than 200. That’s because the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has decided not to renew $800,000 that had been going to Alpha House, the Salvation Army and the Spring for transitional housing.

In response to the loss of the funding, homeless initiative CEO Antoinette Hayes Triplett has told her board members that HUD has shifted its emphasis toward supporting programs that put people in permanent housing along with providing them with social services. And officials note that HUD has shifted money in similar ways in Miami-Dade, Indiana and New York.

In response, administrators with the Salvation Army and Alpha House have questioned whether the homeless initiative turned in a flawed grant application — the group has acknowledged there was a coding error regarding Alpha House in the application — that contributed to the loss of funding.

Still, Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said, HUD clearly is moving away from transitional housing programs that are ""outdated and inefficient.""

""What HUD is, in essence, telling them is, ‘We’re only going to fund those that are doing it differently,"" Buckhorn said in an interview before the homeless count results were made public last week.

One alternative that Hillsborough County and Tampa officials have increasingly turned to is known as ""housing first."" Housing first targets chronically homeless individuals with permanent housing backed up by social services and counseling. The approach is considered to be cost-efficient, freeing up money for other homeless populations in the long run, because it reduces the number of times that chronically homeless people end up in hospital emergency rooms or jail — both of which are expensive, temporary and less-than-ideal ways to deal with recurring problems.

The County Commission put more than $2.4 million into Hillsborough’s first housing first project, the 23-unit Cypress Landing apartments, which opened near University Mall in January 2013.

Since then, the city and county put each put $250,000 into an effort by the nonprofit Housing Steps Forward to rehabilitate the Southland Apartments between Gandy Boulevard and MacDill Air Force Base. The public subsidies supported the conversion of 16 of the complex’s 45 units into housing-first units for homeless veterans.

""That’s how you actually help people, because you wrap them with social services,"" Buckhorn said. ""Merely feeding them and allowing them to sleep on the floor and then pushing them out the next day without dealing with all the other stuff in their lives — the drugs and the alcohol and the medical illness — doesn’t help. It doesn’t solve anybody’s problems. So I think HUD is saying loud and clear to those providers, either change your model, go to a housing first-type model or we’re not going to fund you.""

And Buckhorn said the city feels the same way, so if it’s going to put its money into homeless initiatives, they’ll be housing first projects.

This spring, the city put out a request for proposals to use about $400,000 in federal funds to build or rehabilitate apartments for chronically homeless tenants. It got one response, from Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Petersburg.

Catholic Charities focuses on the chronically homeless as a primary population, executive director Mark Dufva. It has land next to Mercy House on N Florida Avenue that it is looking at developing in stages. Its proposal to the city was for five efficiency units, and it is still evaluating its plans, Dufva said.

But just because there was only one proposal doesn't mean the city will accept it as submitted. A city review committee Monday gave Catholic Charities' proposal low marks for a lack of detail on its support service partners, service plan, development plan and construction plan.

""I think we might have to put it back out,"" city housing and community development manager Vanessa McCleary told review committee members.",23/05/2016
Tampa Bay Times,PolitiFact Florida: Fact-checking claim that Amendment 2 will bring more pot shops than Walmarts and Walgreens,"Opponents of Florida's medical marijuana amendment have fired up a new round of attacks, claiming there will be a dispensary on practically every corner if voters approve the initiative.

In a three-minute ad released May 16, the group Vote No On 2 calls Amendment 2 ""a scam to legalize pot."" Should the measure pass, they say, it's likely that places to buy medical marijuana will outnumber two large chains.

""Looks like Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida … more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined,"" the video says.

While polls say medical marijuana is enjoying about 80 percent support among voters, Vote No On 2's figures spark an interesting point. Would the number of medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens locations in Florida?

That's possible, according to one state estimate, but the figures are a little hazy.

United for Care, the group behind the measure, altered the language of Amendment 2 set for the November ballot to address some concerns that hounded the failed proposal in 2014. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated,"" with a doctor's recommendation.

It works like this: If a patient with one of these conditions gets the okay from a doctor, he or she (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card and be able to go to a state-regulated dispensary to buy marijuana.

So how many dispensaries would there be? The proposal leaves the details of medical marijuana regulations up to the Legislature and the Florida Health Department. Legislators would need to pass a bill for medical marijuana and the health department would develop regulations. There could be as few or as many dispensaries as the state wants.

There is only one estimate for how many patients and dispensaries there would be: a 2015 health department analysis.

That report used state demographic data to estimate 440,552 patients in Florida would qualify for medical cannabis. The amendment would lead to 1,993 registered treatment centers, the agency said.

United for Care doesn't dispute the figures, because the health department's analysis is the only study that's been done.

In any event, 1,993 dispensaries would outnumber all of the Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida. The video correctly shows 840 Walgreens drug stores in the state, but its citation of 191 Walmarts is outdated. A more recent list shows 223 Walmart supercenters and 10 discount stores. (Neighborhood Markets and Sam's Club stores are not included in either count.)

Vote No On 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson said the group chose those retailers to show how ubiquitous dispensaries would be should the amendment pass. It may be better to compare so-called ""pot shops"" to the overall number of pharmacies rather than big chains with pharmacies. There are 9,725 licensed pharmacies in Florida.

For another comparison, the state counts 2,082 active licensed veterinary clinics and 1,893 package liquor stores.

Mile-high estimate

With so little spelled out in the proposed amendment, we wondered how the health department arrived at its estimate.

The analysis used Colorado, with about 5.3 million people, because the state has allowed medical cannabis for years and has a broad baseline of data. The report says there are 515 licensed medical marijuana centers as of October 2015 (there are 528 now, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue) serving almost 114,000 patients. Analysts then scaled that up to Florida's population of 20 million to get 1,993 dispensaries.

Karen O'Keefe, director of state policies and the prolegislation Marijuana Policy Project, said of the 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing medical marijuana, it's misleading to use either Colorado or California as examples for Florida. Not only did Colorado decriminalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 — its 421 retail shops are counted separately from medical dispensaries — but both states lacked the kind of initial regulatory oversight Amendment 2 would require.

A better state to look to would be New Mexico, O'Keefe said, because its law required a licensing program. New Mexico had 23 dispensaries for its 2 million residents, expanding to 35 in 2015.

Extrapolating Florida's total based on New Mexico would net far fewer dispensaries, she said. If it were based on total land area, Florida could limit the number to about 16. If there were the same number of dispensaries per capita as New Mexico, there could be about 340.

Overall it's important to remember that while the health department report is the only real estimate available, this figure isn't definite. The real number would be hashed out when the amendment passes.

The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

Tampa Bay Times,Study: Living near water has mental health benefits,"There's good reason visions of a relaxing vacation often include the ocean. And why many people fantasize about retiring to the coast. There's a sense of calm and wonder that comes from being by the water.

While the tourism industry and Florida snowbirds have known this forever, there's now research to confirm that living near water may actually improve mental health.

Using Wellington, New Zealand, the urban capital, as its case study, researchers from Michigan State University evaluated residents who lived in neighborhoods with views of either blue or green spaces. Coastal residents saw the Tasman Sea or the Pacific Ocean while inland residents were near forests or parks.

Those who lived near the water reported less psychological distress.

Many other research studies have looked at the correlation between health and coastal living and have found an uptick in mental health among people who live by the water. But Michigan State says it's the first to show an affirmative link between the two based on visibility of water from a person's home.

The original intent of the research was to determine the effect of nature on anxiety and depression, particularly in urban areas where there's less natural beauty. It is well-established that having bodies of water or swaths of green space promotes physical and social activity, and that being near nature has a known stress-reducing effect.

""Green and blue spaces are recognized as therapeutic or salutogenic places and may lower psychological distress by serving as calming backdrops in residential neighborhoods,"" the authors wrote.

Using data from the New Zealand Health Survey, researchers were able to compare mental health statistics to where people live.

What they found is that there was no significant benefit for people living near green areas, but there was for people who lived by the water. Even when they broke down demographics by age, sex and personal income, there was still an improvement in mental health among people closer to the ocean.

This bears out in U.S. studies of mental health as well. Hawaii is ranked the No. 1 happiest and healthiest state in America, according to the annual Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.

There are, of course, notable limitations to such a study, which the authors detail at length in their paper. For one, they note that the blue spaces in Wellington are a better representation of natural beauty than the city's green ones, which are mostly parks and sports fields. Moreover, would the same results be true of other bodies of water that aren't oceans?

""If the type of water is irrelevant, similar findings could potentially be evaluated on large fresh water bodies, such as the North American Great Lakes,"" the authors wrote. ""If the type of water is salient, this may relate not only to the visibility of the ocean, but the other sensory stimuli related to the ocean, including the sound of waves and the smell of air passing over the ocean.""

Still, the researchers argue that such findings could help identify some tangible ways to help treat mental illness. In April, the World Bank and the World Health Organization held a meeting about how to create a global agenda for mental health, calling it a critical issue on par with where HIV/AIDS was 20 years ago.

Tampa Bay Times,Gov. Rick Scott to honor surgeon general who lost job,"John Armstrong, the former state surgeon general who lost his job after the Senate did not confirm his appointment, will be honored Monday evening by Gov. Rick Scott.

The governor will hold a reception at the Governor's Mansion in Tallahassee, according to his schedule.

Armstrong was one of the longest serving agency heads in the Scott administration, running the Department of Health from 2012 until March 11, the final day of the legislative session and the deadline for the Senate to confirm him. He previously was a medical officer at the University of South Florida and an Army surgeon.

Interim Surgeon General Celeste Philip then hired him as deputy secretary for administration in DOH, but he has been taking a medical leave of absence as he battles colon cancer.

Senate Democrats and South Florida Republicans blocked Armstrong's confirmation earlier this year, raising questions about children being unenrolled from the Children's Medical Services program, the handling of a medical marijuana program passed by the Legislature in 2014 and rising cases of HIV, which were most severe in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.",09/05/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Openness needed on Florida HIV numbers,"Florida Department of Health officials are finally starting to shed light on how the agency recalculated the state's HIV count. The department recently provided details about the process on its website. It's a good start, but it's not enough. Members of Congress should continue to demand that the agency come clean about its shifting HIV numbers. The public deserves to know the full scope of Florida's problem so adequate resources can be assigned to the fight.

Under pressure from members of Florida's congressional delegation, Health Department officials began releasing information on how the HIV count revisions were reached. Earlier this year, amid a bruising confirmation battle for then-state surgeon general Dr. John Armstrong, the Health Department changed the number of new HIV cases recorded in Florida in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613. The revision was markedly larger than in previous years. Officials also made downward revisions to a decade's worth of the state's HIV cases. Health Department officials refused to comment broadly about the move, saying only that duplications were responsible for the revisions, including double counting people who were diagnosed in one state but lived in another. That explanation might have been plausible in any single year, but the scope of the revisions and their timing made them highly suspect.

In a letter to Gov. Rick Scott, a bipartisan group of Florida congressional representatives — including Democrats Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Republicans Ted S. Yoho and Mario Diaz-Balart — took the department to task for its ""vague and imprecise explanations"" regarding the status of new HIV infections and called into question the agency's commitment to competency and transparency. Specifically, the letter writers want the department to respond to questions about the evidence used to justify the revisions, the number of cases shifted to other years and the number of cases assigned to other states. These are reasonable questions that the state should answer.

State officials were wrong to wait so long to begin providing information to the public about the revisions. Deflecting questions to a website and refusing to make the agency head available for comment is a betrayal of the public trust on a topic that is too important to dismiss so cavalierly. The public still deserves a full accounting of the data and the methodology used to collect it. Scott should require health officials to be transparent and accountable. Members of Congress should watch the agency closely and continue to press for greater transparency.

HIV remains a public health scourge. But now, decades after HIV and AIDS roiled the country, the disease can be prevented or at least better managed. Any spike in new cases should be alarming. Accurate data is critical to understanding and responding appropriately to a growing problem. If the state has nothing to hide, it should keep releasing information and open its books to an independent investigator so the public can have confidence that it is not being duped.",06/05/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Under congressional pressure, Florida officials elaborate on drop in HIV cases","After weeks of not answering questions on controversial revisions to the state HIV count, the Florida Department of Health has released more detailed information on the state's calculations.

In a list of frequently asked questions posted Friday to the Department of Health's website, officials said they send information about all new HIV cases to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC then identifies cases that may have been counted in more than one state and asks those health departments to decide where the case was first diagnosed.

Florida health officials said they have had thousands more potential duplicates to review because a larger share of laboratories are now reporting results electronically. The officials also said the CDC had ""expanded the criteria for identifying potential duplicate cases.""

The explanation comes as the Department of Health faces criticism for altering the number of new HIV cases diagnosed in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613. The revisions were the largest made in recent history and came as then-state Surgeon General John Armstrong was under fire for a spike in HIV rates.

In March, a Tampa Bay Times analysis found the Department of Health had not only changed the number of new cases in 2014, but also had made sizable revisions to the data dating back a decade. For several weeks, the department declined to provide detailed information about how cases had been reclassified or assigned to other states.

In its latest release, state health officials said many of the cases identified as duplicates in Florida ended up on the New York, California and Georgia rolls.

It's unclear whether the information will satisfy 11 members of Congress from Florida who last week asked Republican Gov. Rick Scott for a thorough breakdown of the revised data, expressing concerns about ""statistical integrity.""

U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican, thanked Scott on Twitter for releasing the information.

But U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Tampa Democrat who has also asked federal officials to investigate, said she had lingering questions. She wanted more details on how the state removed duplicate cases.

""We've really got to understand county by county what is happening,"" Castor said. ""Otherwise, the questions of data manipulation will continue to haunt them.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Responding to congressional HIV questions, state points to website","Interim state Surgeon General Celeste Philip on Friday responded to a letter from 11 members of Congress demanding an explanation of how Florida changed its count of new HIV cases.

The members of Congress, which include Republicans and Democrats from across the state, wrote to Gov. Rick Scott earlier this week asking about why the Florida Department of Health revised the number of new infections reported in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613.

That 25-percent change was much larger than adjustments made in recent years, a Tampa Bay Times analysis found. It was made as the state faced criticism for a spike in HIV cases, particularly in South Florida, which led the nation for new infections.

Philip directed the members of Congress to the HIV Data Center, a website launched Thursday that explains the basics of a process known as ""de-duplication."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she wrote, comb through data reported from every state and try to identify possible duplicate cases, but the states are ultimately responsible for ensuring their case numbers are accurate.

She also said she is ""happy to sit down and more closely explore the data with you at any time.""

However, Philip did not provide details requested by the members of Congress about how the Department of Health's process for removing duplicate cases has changed, or specifics about how each infection was reclassified or removed.

The Times has been asking for this information since March and has not received an answer either.

A spike in reported HIV cases was among the reasons Surgeon General John Armstrong was not confirmed by the Florida Senate earlier this year. In the aftermath of Times reporting on the state's revised data, U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, called for a federal investigation.",30/04/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Members of Congress demand answers from Gov. Rick Scott on revised HIV numbers,"Eleven members of Florida's Congressional Delegation are pressing Gov. Rick Scott to explain how the state changed its count of new HIV cases amid a controversy over the numbers.

The members, a mix of Democrats and Republicans representing districts from North Florida to the Keys, sent Scott a letter Thursday demanding to know why the state health department revised the number of new infections reported in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613.

A Tampa Bay Times analysis found the 25 percent adjustment was much larger than any adjustment made in recent years. That report also noted that the numbers were revised as the state faced heavy scrutiny over a spike in HIV cases that year.

""The large data revision combined with these vague and imprecise explanations has created uncertainty regarding the true status of new HIV infections in Florida, as well as questions regarding (the Florida Department of Health's) competency and transparency,"" the members of Congress wrote.

Statistical integrity, they added, has ""vital ramifications for Florida and our nation.""

""The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), in particular, uses the data collected by each state to compile national statistics, and this data influences resource allocation and grant funding, as well as response actions,"" they wrote.

Earlier in the day, state health officials released some more detailed information about a process known as ""de-duplication,"" which they say helps explain the changes.

Health Department spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said the CDC had recently changed the criteria for identifying cases that may have been counted twice or in two different states, causing Florida to have to sift through more records.

The process takes months, she added. Data from 2014 won't be finalized until June 30 of this year.

Despite the new details, the health department has failed explain how each infection was either reclassified or removed from the rolls. What's more, the department has declined to make interim state Surgeon General Celeste Philip or anybody in the HIV/AIDS department available for an interview.

Florida's HIV statistics have been in the public eye since January, when a spike in the number of new cases diagnosed in 2014 cost then-Surgeon General John Armstrong his job.

The new, lower figures were published around the same time.

Last month, a Times analysis found the adjustment was twice as large as any adjustment made in the past decade. The Times also found Florida had recently changed the annual counts dating back more than a decade, removing more than 7,300 cases from the rolls.

The analysis prompted U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, to call for a federal investigation. Castor cited ""widespread questions over the accuracy of the HIV/AIDS numbers in Florida"" in her letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell.

Castor was among the 11 members of Congress who signed the letter to Scott on Thursday. She was joined by Democratic Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Ted Deutch, Alcee Hastings, Patrick Murphy, Lois Frankel and Frederica Wilson, and Republican representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Curbelo and Ted Yoho.

The members asked Scott for specific information on what evidence had been used to justify the revisions. They also wanted to know how many cases had been shifted to other states or reporting years.

""We hope that you will conduct a thorough examination of Florida's new HIV infection rate data and make it publicly available, to ensure that this critical information has been accurately and transparently recorded, reported and revised,"" they wrote.

They pointed out that Florida continues to be a national leader in terms of new infections.

""Floridians deserve clarification on how (the Florida Department of Health) records, reports, and revises public health data, especially with respect to new HIV infections in our state,"" they wrote.

Tampa Bay Times,"States can't block Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood, feds say","States like Florida can't block Medicaid money from abortion clinics, federal officials said in a letter to state health officials Tuesday.

""Providing the full range of women's health services neither disqualifies a provider from participating in the Medicaid program, nor is the provision of such services inconsistent with the best interests of the beneficiary and shall not be grounds for a state's action against a provider,"" Vikki Wachino, director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, wrote in the letter, which was also sent to groups representing the nation's governors, state lawmakers and public health officials.

Translation: You can't exempt Planned Parenthood or any other abortion clinic from Medicaid just for being an abortion clinic.

Last month, Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed a controversial law that blocks all state money, including Medicaid, from abortion clinics, including preventive services like cancer screenings and HIV testing. State law already prevented taxpayer dollars from funding abortions.

The state can't do that unless the federal government agrees. And Wachino's letter sounds like an early ""no.""

The money on the line across the state is uncertain, ranging from $114,000 according to Scott's office to $500,000 according to Planned Parenthood.

Asked whether the state has requested approval to stop the flow of funds to abortion clinics or whether it believes it has the legal authority to do so, Agency for Health Care Administration spokeswoman Shelisha Coleman said in a statement Tuesday that, ""We’re looking at all of our options.""

Federal law gives Medicaid recipients the right to be served by ""any institution, agency, community pharmacy or person qualified to perform the service or services required,"" according to Wachino's letter.

While states are allowed to set ""reasonable standards"" related to quality, they can't ""target a provider or set of providers,"" unless they fail to meet quality standards or have shoddy billing practices.

The law in question -- HB 1411 -- does set other quality standards that abortion-rights supporters say could lead to clinics closing. But the potential loss of funding is also of concern.

State lawmakers said the law ensures opponents of abortion aren't forced to indirectly pay for the procedure via tax dollars that go to clinics for other procedures.

""The idea that those taxpayer dollars would go to an organization that performs abortions is simply intolerable,"" Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said during a Senate floor debate in March.",19/04/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Kathy Castor calls for federal review on shifting Florida HIV stats,"U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, is calling for a federal investigation into Florida's recently adjusted HIV statistics.

Earlier this year, state health officials revised the number of new HIV cases reported in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613, removing about 25 percent of new infections from the books.

The state regularly adjusts its health statistics. But the most recent changes to the HIV data were significantly larger than in any changes made in recent years, according to a Tampa Bay Times analysis. What's more, they came at a time when state lawmakers were pressing the health department over a reported spike in new HIV infections.

The health department's ""significant amendment has prompted widespread questions over the accuracy of the HIV/AIDS numbers in Florida, especially as most local agencies report a significant increase in the number of new infections,"" Castor wrote Tuesday in a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. ""I respectfully request a review by the Department of Health and Human Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or the Office of National AIDS policy to help determine accurate numbers and whether or not the state manipulated crucial HIV data.""

The health department has said it changed the number to account for infections that had already been counted in other states.

But Castor said Florida ""has an unfortunate history of purposely ignoring or in some cases deliberately failing in its duty to provide adequate care to its citizens."" She noted the state health department had recently ""screened out"" thousands of kids from a program for children with profound special needs.

""Florida may have the largest increase in the rate of new HIV cases,"" Castor wrote. ""Floridians deserve to know the public health facts.""",12/04/2016
Tampa Bay Times,U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor calls for federal review of Florida's shifting HIV statistics,"U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, is calling for a federal investigation into the ""dramatic"" changes made to Florida's HIV statistics.

Earlier this year, the state department of health changed the number of new HIV cases reported in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613. State health officials said the 25 percent adjustment was routine.

But the revision was significantly larger than any revision made in recent years, a Tampa Bay Times analysis found. What's more, it was made as state lawmakers grilled Florida's top health official over a reported spike in new HIV infections.

The health department's ""significant amendment has prompted widespread questions over the accuracy of the HIV/AIDS numbers in Florida, especially as most local agencies report a significant increase in the number of new infections,"" Castor wrote Tuesday in a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell.

""I respectfully request a review by the Department of Health and Human Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or the Office of National AIDS policy to help determine accurate numbers and whether or not the state manipulated crucial HIV data,"" she added.

The state health department declined to comment on the letter.

State health officials have said they changed the data to account for infections that had already been counted in other states or were inadvertently logged twice. The process, known as de-duplication, is done regularly in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control.

But the Times analysis, published last month, found that Florida made larger-than-usual adjustments to the 2014 figures, as well as major revisions to the annual counts dating back to 2005.

The health department has since declined to provide a breakdown of how infections were either reclassified or removed — or any public records fully explaining why this year's process turned up more duplicates than previous years.

The department has also failed to make interim state Surgeon General Dr. Celeste Philip available for an interview, even though Philip released a statement last month saying ""we welcome the opportunity to discuss with the Tampa Bay Times the entire data gathering and de-duplication process to clear up the misconceptions presented in the article.""

Last week, the department released a report issued by the CDC after a routine site visit to Tallahassee in early January. The report praised Florida for ""continued excellence and high levels of achievement in meeting all of the national HIV case surveillance process and outcome standards,"" and called its program for training field staff ""impressive.""

The report mentioned a backlog in entering information that could help determine duplicate cases. But it did not explain why so many changes were made dating back a decade. What's more, it was unclear if the CDC's visit took place before of after the state adjusted the HIV data.

The health department declined to clarify, issuing only the following statement from Philip: ""As the CDC report shows, Florida's HIV data program is a national leader in helping health officials better understand and treat this terrible disease. We are also proud to have the opportunity to train professionals from other states on the best practices for collecting and interpreting HIV data.""

Florida's spiking HIV statistics were thrust into the spotlight in late January, when state lawmakers blasted then state Surgeon General Dr. John Armstrong for the original tally of new infections from 2014.

The dramatic increase — and the fact that the original figure made Florida the national leader in new infections — were key reasons Armstrong lacked enough support in the Senate to be confirmed this spring. He resigned from the position in March.

During the confirmation process, Armstrong did not state publicly the number of HIV cases diagnosed in 2014 had been revised downward, or that the new count put Florida behind published counts for two other states.

In her letter to the federal health department, Castor said Florida has ""an unfortunate history of purposely ignoring or in some cases deliberately failing in its duty to provide adequate care to its citizens.""

She noted the state health department had recently ""screened out"" thousands of children from a program for kids with profound special needs, only to have the new evaluation process invalidated by a judge.

""Florida may have the largest increase in the rate of new HIV cases,"" Castor wrote, noting that federal funding is based on state counts. ""Floridians deserve to know the public health facts.""

Tampa Bay Times,What I learned about Trump and life from binge-watching 'The Apprentice',"The morning the Trumpucation began, America already was in the manic phase of the Trumpcycle.

I had barely sipped coffee. Sacha Baron Cohen was on Today in character as an English soccer player, fantasizing about Donald Trump getting HIV. Then the ads started. Anti-Trump ad, pro-Trump ad, Trump smiling, Make America Great Again hat on. Trump, Trump, Trump.

I turned on the DVD player. For a moment, there was silence. Then.

""Work hard, move faster, hard, faster."" Trump was half-rapping, like the Chicago Bears in '85, over The Apprentice DVD menu. There was no turning back, like in therapy when you really have to feel things to find your truth.

I hit play.

• • •

I had locked myself up to binge The Apprentice.

Someone had challenged me to watch every episode of the series and study the leading Republican presidential candidate. His management style, his charisma, his intangibles. No politics, all cultural appeal.

We already know so much about Trump. His failings, successes, marriages, incendiary things he has said. We know too much about his bathroom parts. What else could The Apprentice possibly say about Trump?

There are seven seasons of The Apprentice and seven of The Celebrity Apprentice. Watching them all would make it impossible for me to contact the outside world, ever again.

Mercifully, I found only the first season DVDs. Why weren't there others? I inquired four times to two different press people and got no answer. It's ominous, as if NBC knows something we don't. The network announced in September that Arnold Schwarzenegger would replace Trump on The Apprentice. In 2011, Trump told Meredith Viera he would not declare candidacy while his show was on due to the FCC's equal time rules.

Trump: ""I mean, The Apprentice is doing great — The Celebrity Apprentice.""

Vieira: ""What does that have to do… .""

Trump: ""It has a lot to do.""

The year is 2003 in America. Jessica Simpson is married to Nick Lachey. People wear Von Dutch. It's before fourth-wave feminism. Before the housing crisis, the Great Recession. Before Facebook.

It's post-Sept. 11. But on a new NBC show called The Apprentice, there is no talk of the greatest American tragedy. This show is about upward mobility, what you can do if you apply yourself.

There is one man at the center. He, too, has climbed out of a trench.

""Thirteen years ago, I was seriously in trouble,"" Donald Trump says on the first episode. ""I was billions of dollars in debt, but I fought back and won. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills, and I worked it all out. I've mastered the art of the deal, and I've turned the name Trump into the highest quality brand.""

He is joined by on-the-nose American archetypes. There's someone with a Harvard MBA. A copier salesman. A hayseed from Boise. The casting is diverse in the most obligatory way. They are conniving, naive and foolish. They all want to be the next Trump.

Episode One

The contestants get $250 to start a lemonade stand. Lemonade! America! The women get business by flirting. ""A dollar for the lemonade, four dollars for the girl,"" one old dude says, and I want to die.

The men run around with posters.

The women win, of course. As a prize, they go to ... Trump's apartment.

""If you're really successful, you'll all live just like this,"" he says, showing them around the gilded palace. ""Maybe not like this. Or maybe even better. But if you're really successful, this is what it is, and it's fun. I show this apartment to very few people. Presidents. Kings. They walk in, they look around, and they really can't believe what they're seeing.""

Episode Two

A female contestant calls Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, the greatest villain of all time, ""sweetie pie."" OH NO SHE DIDN'T. This is starting to kind of get good. Trump plays on power dynamics.

""I learned at a young age that you have to deal with the boss,"" he says. ""It's very simple. Deal with the boss wherever possible.""

They meet with ad king Donny Deutsch, whose T-shirt exposes his swole guns. As Deutsch says how fun his company is, an employee cruises by on a Razor scooter. In my bones, I can feel producers yell ""3 … 2 … 1 … CUE SCOOTER.""

The candidates advertise a Marquis Jet Card. The campaign from the women is way phallic. They dress up for the pitch in flight attendant uniforms/sex costumes. The guys play it safe. The women win, of course.

Episode Three

They negotiate prices, everything from a leg wax to gold. The women negotiate by dancing for the guy in the gold shop, and begging. The women win, of course.

""You know, as a man, I'm so disappointed with you guys,"" Trump tells the men. ""I don't know what's happening.""

An unlikable person named Sam goes home. But he is fine about it because he got to shake Trump's hand.

Episode Four

Nick the copier salesman thinks there was a witch hunt for Sam. But, no time to mourn! The teams have to manage a night at Planet Hollywood.

The men build incentives for servers to sell more food. The women do shots with the male customers. The women win, of course.

I start to get really fed up. I really want someone to say …

""You are smart, dynamic and attractive women,"" Trump says. ""You beat the guys fair and square, but you're coming a little close to crossing the line, relying on your sexuality to win. Well, it's unnecessary.""

Oh. I'm with Trump. I'm with Trump? I'M WITH TRUMP.

Episode Five

I start to see a morass of clues in the Trumpisms, like the Da Vinci Code.

""Stand up for yourself,"" Trump says. ""You just have to fight for yourself because basically nobody else is going to fight for you.""

Restaurant owner Kristi, who didn't fight for herself, goes home. I feel I have discovered etchings on the back of an ancient Bible. I eat a forkful of cold spaghetti, a piece of rotisserie chicken, a stale Oreo and return to the couch.

Episode Six

It's all ego and celebrities, with a paper-thin veil of pretending to care for others.

The candidates convince Regis Philbin and the guys from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy to donate time for a charity auction. Contestant Tammy insults Carson Daly by suggesting he would fetch more if he could somehow bring Tiger Woods. I mean, she's not wrong.

Tammy the Actual Worst stays, mild-mannered Jessie goes home. The winners are rewarded with a picnic in the grass at Trump's Bedford estate.

Bleary, I type: This will be in a time capsule for when the next species wants to learn of America.

Episodes Seven and Eight

I awake from a deep and sudden sleep. The contestants are selling Trump Ice, water with The Donald's face on the bottle. It is sweeter than all other water! I am strangely thirsty.

The contestants fly over the Statue of Liberty! AMERICA.

""I got to see that pretty lady in full view,"" says Troy from Boise, whose accent could pickle a green bean.

Episodes Trumpy, Trumperson and Trumpface

""You gotta believe in what you're selling. If you don't believe in it, if you don't really believe it yourself, it'll never sell and you're going to be miserable.""

""I have my own hair.""

""Don't you hate to lose?""

Finale

It's down to two. Bill Rancic has much hair and seems pretty reasonable. Kwame Jackson has the Harvard degree, but probably is too laid back. They host separate events, a golf tournament at Trump's course, and a J. Simp concert at the Trump Taj Mahal.

Kwame, who is black, says something so profound, I rewind four times.

""My mom was the first person in my family to go to college and finish, the first person. My grandpa signed his name like a runaway slave with an X. Here I am. I went to Harvard Business School. My grandpa signed his name with an X. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is, in terms of access to opportunity.""

Witch hunts. Lemonade. Romance. Sex. Sexism. Golf. Gambling. Lady Liberty. Job interviews. Real estate. Pop stars. Promises. Opportunity.

What does this show say about Trump? Not much we didn't know.

What does this show say about us?

Of course, America would consider a reality star for president. He set it up for 28 million viewers more than a decade ago, Nostradamus in new construction. Here is America, and here is the man leading it, and here are all of us, watching breathlessly.

Bill wins. The walls of the board room fly open to reveal a LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE. It's like Black Mirror, or The Truman Show, or The Twilight Zone.

Bill's prize is a Chrysler Crossfire (a new car!!!). And a job in Chicago working for Trump.

One of my colleagues interviewed comedian Kathy Griffin, who knows Trump. I had her float a theory. Trump is doing well, in part, because Americans have obsessed over reality TV for two decades.

""That is what he is,"" Griffin said. ""He is a reality show star. … All the years I've known him, he was this wacky Realtor character. … I have seen him play the roles you've seen him play on TV, and the one thing I know personally is for him to be full of s---. I know you can't print that, but I can't get over it.""

That night, I dreamed about Trump, and it felt so real.

I chased him through the Trump Taj Mahal. He wore white flip-flops, and had religious crosses tattooed on his feet. I took photos of him on an iPhone. The more pictures, the better, he said. He smiled for them and kept moving, frantically, a smudged blur against a backdrop of casino clinking and flash. I felt compelled to follow.

Tampa Bay Times,Rick Scott's misleading talking point about 'record' funding for HIV/AIDS,"Asked to explain a discrepancy in the state's number of new HIV cases, Florida Gov. Rick Scott only crowed about how much is being spent on prevention programs.

Florida had the dubious distinction of leading the nation in new HIV cases a few months ago, even as the country's overall trend was declining. Then the state Department of Health's division of disease control revised the numbers, which is a routine practice.

But the Tampa Bay Times found that the adjusted total showed only a slight increase in the number of new cases reported since Scott took office in 2011, putting Florida behind California and Texas. The revisions erased one in four cases in 2014, an unprecedented drop that led experts to question the extent of the changes.

When the Times asked Scott's office why the figures were revised so drastically, spokesman John Tupps said only that Scott is ""proud that Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention.""

For this fact-check, we are putting Scott to the Truth-O-Meter, and not his spokesman, because this has become a talking point of his administration. Scott made a similar claim in a news release after he signed the 2016-17 budget, saying that ""last year, Florida invested a record $34 million in HIV/AIDS prevention.""

Leaving alone the health department's self-editing for a moment, could it be that the state has spent a record amount combatting HIV/AIDS?

Well, the state health department did get more funding for prevention programs in 2015 than ever before. But almost all of that money came from the federal government, not Florida.

Scott's office directed us to the health department, which cited the same amount of $34 million.

The word choice is interesting because ""investing"" makes it sound like the state of Florida is spending tens of millions of its own dollars to address a public health crisis. That $34 million, however, is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not state coffers.

The money is part of an awards process that gives cash to state health departments and some cities that apply for help with curbing HIV/AIDS cases. The CDC awards are for programs like HIV testing, services for HIV-positive patients and their partners, condom distribution and more.

It's not unusual for Florida to receive money from the federal government for this purpose. The CDC provides most of this funding because the agency is in charge of monitoring and fighting infectious diseases, according to Emily McCloskey, senior manager for policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors. The CDC is the primary source of money to deal with HIV and AIDS, but also other STDs and conditions such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, diabetes, arthritis and obesity.

Technically, the pot of money at issue is split between prevention programs and testing. But as you can see, the amount Scott is touting has indeed gone up:

Year: Amount awarded by CDC

2011: $19.4 million

2012: $28.3 million

2013: $30.6 million

2014: $33 million

2015: $34 million

2016: $34.8 million

Sources: CDC, Florida Department of Health, National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors

Florida does add some of its own money to assist with these services. Health department spokeswoman Mara Gambineri told us that an additional $1.4 million in state funding for 2015 was meant ""for a prevention program that includes a public awareness campaign, to operate the HIV hotline and for four targeted outreach coordinators.""

When Scott signed the 2016-17 budget just passed by the Legislature, he noted the state contribution for HIV/AIDS services was upped to $1.65 million — out of a total state budget of $82 billion.

Of course, a higher total from the CDC isn't necessarily because the state showed more commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention. As one of the most populous states, it received more CDC funding than any other state except New York and California in 2015. Florida also has a pronounced problem with HIV infections, as the controversy with the state health department's revisions shows.

McCloskey said the CDC overhauled how it awarded grants for the 2012 fiscal year. That accounted not only for the big jump between 2011 and 2012, but it also affected subsequent years.

The cash Scott is talking about is awarded based on need, taking into account infection rates and patient population, among other factors. The state does have to apply, but the CDC calculates how much Florida gets.

In short, the state has been getting (and spending) more money from the federal government because Florida has needed the help. There's a grain of truth in the sound bite, but Scott ignores context and obscures facts that would lead to a very different impression about an important public health issue. We rate his statement Mostly False.

Tampa Bay Times,Romano: Suspect HIV numbers another case of Rick Scott's Flori-topia?,"The numbers, as they say, do not lie. It's the people inventing those numbers for their own benefit that should make you suspicious as hell.

For instance, the Florida Department of Health came up with a brand-new tally of recent HIV cases in the state, as reported by the Times' Kathleen McGrory.

The original number was 6,147 new cases in 2014, which had a lot of people questioning why Florida was intent on cutting health funding and staff. Not long afterward, the department decided there were actually only 4,613 new cases, an almost 25 percent reduction.

Normally, this would be fantastic news.

But, as it turns out, news is rarely normal in Gov. Rick Scott's version of Flori-topia.

You see, some might say the governor has a habit of manipulating the news to create a make-believe Florida more to his liking. Which is a roundabout way of saying his fingerprints have been found on quite a few fibs.

You might remember the case of Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey. Eight years after being appointed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, Bailey abruptly left office without warning or explanation.

The governor said Bailey resigned. Bailey later said he was fired, and the governor was a liar. This was an important distinction because the governor did not have the authority to fire the commissioner without the permission of at least one Cabinet member, all of whom were led to believe by Scott that Bailey had left voluntarily.

That's just one case. There is also the problem of the Florida prison system, with its suspiciously high number of inmate deaths and cries of understaffing.

The former head of the Department of Corrections told the Miami Herald that Scott's office issued false press releases, asked him to scapegoat innocent employees and orchestrated news conferences as a smokescreen to the real dangers involved.

Or how about when Scott's investigation of Planned Parenthood clinics failed to turn up any evidence of illegal fetal tissue sales? Scott's office rewrote health care agency press releases to remove a one-sentence exoneration of Planned Parenthood.

There's a pattern here to remake Florida in the likeness of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Everyone is happy, everything is upbeat and every word is pure. Except Mr. Rogers didn't fire uncooperative agency heads, and his neighborhood didn't scam voters.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying the Department of Health numbers were fabricated. It's entirely possible they were monumentally miscalculated in the first place. Or maybe the bean counters inexplicably got more aggressive about weeding out duplicates.

The problem is officials kept dodging McGrory's questions about the recount, and workers in the trenches suggest the explanations out of Tallahassee don't add up.

When you factor in this administration's history, it doesn't leave much faith in their fidelity to the truth.

And, in this case, it's not just political shenanigans at stake. This is a potential crisis of significant proportions. If HIV cases in Florida are spiking, it's a problem that needs attention. And it's news that residents need to be aware of.

We've all accepted that spinning the news has become a political reality.

What's maddening, and unacceptable, is they take it a step farther and try to spin an alternate reality in Florida.",28/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Fishy numbers on HIV in Florida,"The Florida Health Department's recent downward revision of new HIV infections in the state is suspicious. Health officials lowered the number of new cases in 2014 by one-fourth, an action that prompts questions about the state's record-keeping practices and the validity of the data, particularly in light of the Rick Scott administration's history of withholding public information. An independent investigation would settle the issue and give the public confidence in the accuracy of the state's count.

The Tampa Bay Times’ Kathleen McGrory reported Sunday that last month the Health Department quietly lowered the number of new HIV cases recorded in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613. The original number had represented a shocking spike for Florida and made it the national leader for new HIV infections. State officials said last week that revisions to HIV counts are routine and attributed the new numbers to duplicate cases, including newly infected people who were counted in Florida but lived in other states. The Health Department also made revisions to its HIV counts dating back to 2005, an adjustment that shaved off 7,300 infections. Those errors should have been caught long before now.

The sharp revisions came as the state Senate was conducting confirmation hearings for Dr. John Armstrong, Florida's former surgeon general. Senators questioned Armstrong's performance in the role and, among other issues such as budget and staffing cuts at the department, scrutinized the state's record on HIV prevention. The Health Department revised its HIV figures before the Senate relieved Armstrong of his duties. But the timing is unfortunate and raises the appearance that the Scott administration could have coordinated the move.

HIV and AIDS remain serious public health concerns. It is imperative that states have reliable data to allow experts to correctly assess and diagnose the scope of the diseases so that prevention and treatment steps can be shared with people in need. Florida has an obligation to make sure its public health records are accurate and kept free from political intrusion.

Florida now trails California and Texas in the number of new HIV cases. But the state should take no joy in its new ranking. According to the revised count, the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in the state still rose in 2014 and appears to have jumped again in provisional 2015 figures.

Combating HIV will take a coordinated, sustained public health effort aimed at youth, many of whom are unaware of its dangers, and older adults who may no longer fear the infection due to advances in medical treatments. But first, Florida needs to get its HIV count straight with confirmation by an independent third party. Once it does, the state should get serious about preventing new HIV infections. By any measure, Florida has a dismal track record for a disease that is largely preventable and should be on the wane.",28/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Criticized for HIV spike, Florida takes hundreds of cases off the books","State lawmakers blasted the state surgeon general in January for cutting staff and spending at a time when new HIV cases were spiking in Florida.

A month later, the Florida Department of Health quietly revised its figures.

The department's division of disease control lowered the number of new HIV cases logged in 2014 from 6,147 to 4,613 — erasing one in four new infections from the rolls that year, state records show.

The previous tally from 2014 represented a significant uptick as diagnoses nationwide were declining. It was enough to make Florida the national leader in new HIV cases, an embarrassing distinction for the state, Gov. Rick Scott and the health department, and more importantly, a serious public health concern.

The revised figures still represented an increase in new infections through 2014, but a small one. They put Florida behind published counts for California and Texas.

Mara Gambineri, a health department spokeswoman, said the changes had nothing to do with the controversy. Instead, she said, they were routine adjustments intended to remove cases that had been included more than once.

""Maybe they spelled their name differently … or were previously diagnosed in another state,"" Gambineri said.

But experts say an adjustment that large raises questions, even accounting for duplicate cases.

""There shouldn't be that many differences,"" said Jen Kates, who oversees the Global Health & HIV Policy Program at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

The state tweaks the number of new HIV diagnoses regularly, and doesn't consider the data final until the July after they are reported. But the most recent revision was the largest of any dating back to 2009, according to a Tampa Bay Times analysis of available reports.

The changes weren't limited to the new cases from 2014. State health officials revised the counts dating back to 2005, reducing the overall number of cases diagnosed over the past decade by more than 7,300. No previous adjustment between one year's report and the next removed more than 1,400 cases, the Times analysis found.

The figures now show a slight decline in new cases from 2011, when Scott took office, to 2014. The previous report showed the number of new infections rising.

Scott's office declined to comment on the revisions. Spokesman John Tupps said the governor is ""proud that Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention.""

Experts say the process of tallying diagnoses can be tricky. Adjustments are almost always necessary, said Mary Ann Chiasson, a public health professor at Columbia University who helped oversee HIV/AIDS surveillance in New York City from 1986 to 1999. But they tend to be small, she said.

Accuracy matters. The figures help public health experts determine how effectively they are fighting the epidemic, and how much funding state, counties and cities should receive.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which uses the data collected by each state to compile national statistics, declined to comment on the adjustments in Florida.

Gambineri said her department found more duplicates than usual this year because of changes in how data was collected across the country. In addition, she noted that earlier this year Florida made a change to the way it reports new HIV cases. Instead of counting cases by the year they were reported, the state now tallies cases by the year they were diagnosed, she said.

She also said the number of new diagnoses for 2014 may have been artificially inflated because residents of other states come to Florida for HIV testing.

""We have more than 1,500 public sites where people can get tested,"" she said, adding that non-residents who test positive in Florida should be counted in the state where they live.

She declined to provide the Times with a breakdown on how cases had been either reclassified or removed from the most recent data set.

The reduction surprised some service providers.

""On the ground, it doesn't really feel like a slow-down,"" said Audrey Gardner, the medical case management program director for the Northeast Florida AIDS Network.

Sylvia Hubbard, who runs a Tallahassee-based nonprofit called Minority Alliance Advocating Community Awareness and Action, or MAACA, said she had seen a sharp increase in new HIV diagnoses.

The controversy over Florida's climbing HIV diagnoses had been building for several months. It boiled over in January, when several members of the Florida Senate highlighted the original 2014 figure in relation to state Surgeon General John Armstrong's confirmation. It became one of the key reasons the Senate declined to keep the Scott appointee in the job in March.

""It was a huge concern,"" said state Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Miami Gardens Democrat who opposed Armstrong's confirmation. ""The number (of new HIV cases) was going through the roof and the health department was making (personnel) cuts.""

The state published its new set of numbers for 2014 in late February, before Armstrong lost his job. It also issued ""provisional"" figures for 2015 that show the number of cases continuing to rise.

Asked why the health department didn't use the revised 2014 numbers to defend Armstrong, Gambineri said her office had tried to get the word out by distributing a new HIV/AIDS fact sheet and submitting editorials to newspapers across Florida. A sample editorial she provided to the Times, however, did not mention the revised numbers.

Braynon said he believes the health department was ""trying look better after they were shamed about these numbers.""

""We've seen this before,"" Braynon said. ""They are conveniently using statistics to make a political point.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Gov. Scott signs needle exchange, rape kit bills","Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday signed into law new requirements that rape kits be tested faster, as well as a needle exchange program to combat HIV in South Florida.

The new rape kit law is intended to prevent future backlogs in the wake of Florida Department of Law Enforcement reports that 13,000 kits lie untested in the state.

It requires state crime labs to test kits within 120 days of receiving them.

""This legislation will provide thousands of women with a renewed sense of safety and closure as they heal from the horrific crime of rape,"" Scott said in a written statement.

To start addressing the existing backlog, the state budget signed by the governor last week inlcudes $10.7 million for the crime labs. Still, that could take years.

""As a career prosecutor, I have seen first-hand the heartache caused by sexual assault,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement, ""and this legislation is a significant step toward bringing more predators to justice and helping victims heal.""

Scott also signed a law allowing the University of Miami to give out free, clean needles and syringes in exchange for used ones. Its goal is to reach drug users, who are particularly succeptible to contracting HIV and AIDS.

""The issue we have of addiction and AIDS is not only a Miami-Dade issue, it's a Florida issue,'' Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, said when the Legislature voted to create the program. ""This is just the beginning.""

Taxpayer money can't be used for the program, which will include a mobile unit to bring the exchange to people without transportation.

Other states have turned to needle exchanges to combat infection crises, and Scott's bill signing comes as Florida leads the nation for new HIV infections. South Florida is the epicenter of the disease's growth, but people like Braynon hope to see it expand beyond the Miami-Dade County limits.

It's taken four years to pass the pilot program, but a provision requiring the exchange to provide information about addiction and substance abuse treatment brought conservatives, as well as the Florida Department of Health on board.

Here is the complete list of bills Scott signed into law Wednesday:

* Medical Assistant Certification: This bill repeals a voluntary certification for medical assistants. (SB 238)

* An Infectious Disease Elimination Pilot Program: This bill establishes a pilot program at the University of Miami to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other blood borne diseases. (SB 242)

* Vision Care Plans: This bill relates to health insurance requirements for ophthalmologists and optometrists. (SB 340)

* Physical Therapy: This bill relates to the licensure of physical therapists. (SB 450)

* Adoption: This bill allows judges to make adoption decisions based on the best interest of the child and makes other changes to adoption procedures. (SB 590)

* Rape Kits: This bill requires rape kits to be tested within a specified time frame. (SB 636)

* Foster Families: This bill designates the second week of February as ""Foster Family Appreciation Week."" (SB 860)

* Residential Facilities: This bill clarifies distance requirements for community residential homes. (SB 1174)

* A Review Under the Open Government Sunset Review: This bill reenacts an existing public records exemption relating to the Florida Health Choices Program. (SB 7020)",23/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: New abortion restrictions should not stand,"The Florida Legislature has been brazen in its repeated attempts to restrict access to abortion. Thankfully, some of the most blatant restrictions proposed this year never made it to the full House or Senate. But a bill that would siphon money away from preventive care efforts for women who are exercising their constitutional right was approved and sent to Gov. Rick Scott. If the governor follows through with his signal that he will sign the bill into law, it should be challenged in court.

Sponsored by Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, the legislation would require doctors who perform abortions at clinics to have admitting privileges at hospitals within a ""reasonable proximity"" to the clinic unless the facility has a transfer agreement with the hospital. The bill also would ban sending state money to clinics that perform abortions even though the money is for other uses. Each year, about $200,000 in Medicaid funds is spent on preventive care programs, including tests for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and cancer screenings.

Supporters who argue that the bill will improve women's health care offerings are not fooling anyone. State law already bans using public money to pay for abortions. This legislation is a swipe at Planned Parenthood, which provides preventive care in addition to abortions. The organization drew the ire of abortion-rights opponents last summer after its officials were secretly videotaped having distasteful conversations about the collection of fetal tissue used in scientific research. The Legislature continues to wage war against the organization even though a grand jury found Planned Parenthood had not broken the law and instead indicted the undercover activists who videotaped the conversations. Planned Parenthood clinics should not be targeted for closure by budget cuts. That punishes women who depend on the organization for quality, dependable care.

Likewise, the bill's failure to define ""reasonable proximity"" in specifying where doctors must have hospital admitting privileges creates a nebulous standard that leaves too much room for discretion. But more than that, the policy is unnecessary and could force abortion providers to close and leave women who are seeking abortions on their own.

Florida's latest attempt to restrict access to abortion comes after the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments earlier this month in a Texas case in which attorneys argued that similar laws were unconstitutional. The court has not ruled in that case, but it issued an injunction in a Louisiana case to stop a state law that required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at hospitals.

Last year, Scott signed a bill that created a 24-hour waiting period before women could have an abortion. That law is embroiled in legal challenges, as it restricts access to abortions and wrongly asserts that women have not thought deeply about their decisions before showing up for the procedure.

Scott should not make the same mistake twice. Unless he uses his veto pen to stop this abortion legislation, the governor sets the state up for more lawsuits.",17/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"After losing confirmation fight, Dr. John Armstrong has new health department job","TALLAHASSEE — Last week, Dr. John Armstrong lost his job as the state surgeon general after the Senate refused to confirm his appointment, but he already has a new job in the department's leadership.

Armstrong, 53, has been named deputy secretary for administration at DOH, spokeswoman Mara Gambineri confirmed. In the job, he will oversee regulations on doctors and nurses, disability determinations and administrative functions such as accounting and human resources.

But he hasn't started yet.

""Dr. Armstrong remains employed with the Department of Health,"" Gambineri said in an email. ""However, he is currently on medical leave.""

After Armstrong was diagnosed last fall with colon cancer, he took a short leave from his job for treatment but later returned. He is on a new leave of undetermined length as he continues to receive treatment, Gambineri said.

In the meantime, Michele Tallent is the interim deputy secretary. She has been temporarily filling the job since January, when the last deputy secretary, Marty Stubblefield, took a new job as director of financial institutions at the Office of Financial Regulation.

Armstrong's new annual salary will be $119,000, down from $141,000 as surgeon general.

Under standard practice for any employee on sick leave, Armstrong continues to receive a paycheck and benefits, Gambineri said.

Gov. Rick Scott first appointed Armstrong, a former Army surgeon and medical officer at the University of South Florida, in 2012. He served in the position until last Friday evening, when the annual legislative session ended without a confirmation vote in the Senate.

In his place, Scott appointed Dr. Celeste Philip, a family medicine and public health expert, as interim surgeon general. She also served in the role when Armstrong underwent cancer treatment last year.

Armstrong faced criticism from some senators for the department's handling of medical marijuana policy, the removal of 9,000 kids from health coverage under Children's Medical Services and for cutbacks in county health departments even as Florida leads the nation in new HIV cases.

Still, the governor stood by him.

""Even while battling cancer in recent months, Dr. Armstrong displayed unwavering determination to protect Florida families, and I truly appreciate his hard work,"" Scott said in a written statement Friday.

Tampa Bay Times,"Bousquet: Before vetoes, Gov. Rick Scott says he will listen","Four days.

That's how long Gov. Rick Scott had the state budget last year before he vetoed a record $461.4 million in spending by the Legislature.

Lawmakers were livid with Scott, but not just for wiping out their spending priorities. They, along with Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, were shocked at Scott's refusal to give them a perfunctory chance to make the case for their projects.

State government seldom moves that fast.

Scott didn't get last year's budget until June 19, less than two weeks before a new fiscal year was to begin, so in fairness he didn't have much time. But if he had listened, people would have felt that they had a fair hearing.

That's why Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, had this to say about Scott and the new budget when the 2016 session ended Friday: ""My hope would be that the governor just takes his time and allows local communities to advocate their projects. … Give everybody the opportunity to defend what's in the budget.""

In St. Petersburg on Monday, Scott promised that one thing will be different this year: He'll listen.

""I've been talking to House and Senate members all during session, and we've been talking to them the last few days,"" Scott said. ""We've been reviewing the budget. … We've been talking to the legislators. They are all calling.""

Scott said he's taking their calls this time.

""I'm answering, and my team is answering, so we're listening to everybody,"" Scott said.

Scott's challenge this year is whether he'll be consistent in his veto decisions.

The new budget contains nearly as many local projects as last year's — including some of the very same projects Scott eliminated in 2015. How can he justify approving projects this year that he vetoed last year?

Last year, Scott vetoed new college buildings because they ""were not identified as a priority by the college system.""

""He talks about jobs and then he turns around and vetoes them,"" Republican Sen. Greg Evers said after Scott axed a Pensacola industrial park project.

Scott last year vetoed a $350,000 grant to the North Broward Hospital District for awareness of AIDS and HIV, saying that the system ""generates millions in profits … for this purpose.""

(One reason why Scott's top health adviser, Dr. John Armstrong, was ousted from office by the Senate last Friday was because of concerns that the state is doing too little to combat an increase in HIV infections in South Florida.)

Scott last year vetoed money for mentally disabled citizens groups, United Cerebral Palsy and local homeless initiatives in Citrus and Miami-Dade, and his veto message said they were ""not a statewide priority for improving cost, quality and access to health care.""

Scott considers himself a fiscal conservative who is protective of tax dollars, and he's said to have his eye on a run for the U.S. Senate when his term expires in 2018.

He also has to find a way to get along with his fellow Republicans in the Legislature for two more years, and the $83.2 billion budget on its way to his desk is the largest in Florida history.

""I'm going to look and make sure we don't waste anybody's money,"" Scott told reporters at the Capitol last Friday.

The moment the House gives him the budget, he'll have 15 calendar days to act.

Tampa Bay Times,Gov. Rick Scott names new acting surgeon general,"Gov. Rick Scott has appointed the second-in-command at the state Department of Health as acting surgeon general after the Senate did not confirm Dr. John Armstrong for the position during the legislative session.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Florida Surgeon General John Armstrong to lose his job

Effective immediately, Dr. Celeste Philip will take over as the secretary of health and surgeon general. Armstrong lost his job when the legislative session ended at 6:46 p.m. Friday after he was not confirmed by the Florida Senate for two years in a row.

In 2013, Philip, who has expertise in family medicine and public health, was named deputy secretary at DOH. She served as interim surgeon general last fall when Armstrong underwent treatment for colon cancer. She has been with the department since 2008

In addition to deputy secretary, Philip is the deputy state health officer for the Children's Medical Services program. Changes to that program are among the reasons senators opposed Armstrong's confirmation.

Last year, DOH removed 9,000 sick children from coverage under the program, and it also eliminated CMS's standards for pediatric heart surgery. A bill pushing for standards to be re-instituted was short-lived in the Legislature this year.

Armstrong's confirmation was further derailed after reports in the Times/Herald about reductions to personnel and patient visits during his tenure even while rates of STDs like HIV rose dramatically.

Earlier this week, Senate President Andy Gardiner said he would allow the confirmation to end in the chamber's Ethics and Elections Committee, where Armstrong did not have enough support to win approval and proceed to a floor vote.

Last year, he was not confirmed during the showdown over Medicaid expansion.

Still, Scott has stood by the embattled surgeon general, who was among his longest-serving agency heads after being appointed in 2012.

""Even while battling cancer in recent months, Dr. Armstrong displayed unwavering determination to protect Florida families, and I truly appreciate his hard work,"" Scott said in a written statement Friday. He has been instrumental in ensuring Florida is the leading destination for cancer research and treatment, and has done a tremendous job preparing Floridians and visitors when our state has been confronted with health epidemics like Zika or Ebola.""

Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, who led the opposition against Armstrong's confirmation, said he believes Scott has every right to appoint who he wants to the job and that he did not support Armstrong because of his three-year record. This new surgeon general will not have that record.

""I've been second-in-command many times, and I do what first-in-command tells you to do,"" Braynon said. ""So I would give that person the opportunity to be a different person.""",12/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Editorial: A quiet, mixed year for the Florida Legislature","They repealed the ban on unmarried couples living together, closed public records to protect Ultimate Fighter broadcasts and earmarked millions for police radios nobody requested. They kept a new downtown medical school for the University of South Florida on track but refused to spend a nickel on a Tampa waterfront park. They pushed out the state's surgeon general, approved a new Holocaust memorial for the state Capitol grounds and voted to remove a statue of a Confederate general from the U.S. Capitol.

The Florida Legislature quietly adjourned its annual session Friday with just a few minor bumps, approving an $82.3 billion state budget and avoiding the political infighting that would have further angered voters in an election year. With all 120 House seats and 40 Senate seats up for grabs, this was a session of modest accomplishments and plenty of posturing to please special interest groups. Big ideas for solving big issues, from tax reform to access to affordable health care to mass transit, will have to wait. Again.

Grading on a curve, lawmakers approved a more responsible state budget than they have in recent years. There are just $129 million in tax cuts, and a modest 1 percent increase in per student spending is covered by state tax dollars rather than by local property tax increases triggered by higher property values. There is more money to help restore the Everglades, and there are smart investments to cut waiting lists for services for people with disabilities and to improve mental health services. This was a budget from the Republican-controlled Legislature Democrats could support.

Yet there are serious shortcomings. There still are no general pay raises for state workers. There is no money to hire more than 700 prison guards needed to restore order in the prison system. Lawmakers once again gave both traditional public schools and privately run charter schools $75 million in construction money, even though charter schools have a fraction of the students and facilities. Millions are squandered on foolish teacher bonuses tied to their college-admission test scores that have no relation to their performance. And there was the usual last-minute grab bag of nearly $100 million in local projects that magically appeared and are sure to catch the attention of Gov. Rick Scott as he decides which line items to veto.

When legislators tackled big issues, they often came up short of real reform. They approved a sweeping water bill that focuses on cleaning up the Everglades and the state's springs but tilts toward the demands of agriculture and suburban growth. They reformed the death penalty sentencing law to meet the requirements of a U.S. Supreme Court opinion but failed to require a unanimous jury recommendation for death, which will spark further legal challenges. They expanded the legal use of medical marijuana for terminally ill patients, but it remains narrower than a constitutional amendment on the November ballot.

In some cases, this Republican-controlled Legislature appeared downright progressive. It stood up to Scott and refused his demand for $250 million in corporate welfare for companies that pledge to create jobs that may not appear for years. It allowed lawfully residing immigrant children who have been living in the United States less than five years to be insured under the KidCare program. The National Rifle Association's demands to allow more than 1.5 million gun owners with concealed weapons permits to carry guns on college campuses and openly in other places passed the House but died in the Senate. So did the so-called ""sanctuary cities"" bill, which targeted local governments that correctly refuse to do the work of the federal government in detaining undocumented immigrants. That just might have something to do with the new Senate districts that should produce more competitive races in the fall.

Yet the Legislature remains more conservative than the state itself. It approved new requirements for abortion clinics under the guise of safety that would limit access for women exercising their constitutional rights. It foolishly cut about $200,000 in Medicaid money to abortion clinics that is spent on HIV testing, cancer screening, birth control and other health care. After last year's nasty standoff, there was not a peep about revisiting whether to accept federal Medicaid expansion money to help pay for health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured Floridians.

An enormous, misguided school choice bill passed in the legislative session's final hours will create havoc for local school districts. On the plus side, several bad ideas quietly died, including expanded gambling, a path to allow fracking and a bid to count computer coding as a foreign language. But they will be back next year, and legislators fleeing Tallahassee for the campaign trail will be asking to return as well. Voters should review their records closely, and remember that elections have consequences.",11/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Florida Surgeon General John Armstrong to lose his job,"TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Rick Scott's top health officer, Dr. John Armstrong, will lose his job Friday after the state Senate refused to confirm him in a rebuke to a governor-appointed agency head not seen in more than 20 years.

Senate President Andy Gardiner said Wednesday that he will not bring a confirmation vote to the Senate floor before the session ends this week.

""I've really struggled with it,"" Gardiner said. ""He did not have a vote in committee, and we've heard from members of the Democratic caucus that there's a concern.""

Armstrong has been criticized for delays in the rollout of Florida's medical marijuana law and changes to Children's Medical Services that led to 9,000 sick kids being removed from health coverage under the program.

But lawmakers' resistance to confirm him grew after reporting by the Times/Herald in January highlighted a dramatic rise in HIV rates since Armstrong took office four years ago. Florida leads the nation for new infections, especially in South Florida. In the same time that HIV has been on the rise, county health clinics run by Armstrong's Department of Health have cut positions and seen fewer patients.

Armstrong was first appointed surgeon general and secretary of the Department of Health in 2012. He's among the longest-serving agency heads appointed by Scott. Previously, Armstrong was a medical officer at the University of South Florida and a surgeon in the U.S. Army.

The rejection of Armstrong is yet another decisive political defeat for Scott, who repeatedly — and incorrectly — predicted Armstrong would win approval from the Republican-controlled Senate.

Gardiner said he left Scott a voice mail, but had not spoken to him directly by Wednesday evening.

The governor's office refused to say who Scott plans to appoint when Armstrong is forced out.

""We continue to believe Dr. Armstrong is the best person for the job,"" Scott's spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said in a statement.

The last time an agency head was not confirmed was in 1995, when the Senate, where Republicans had just gained control, refused to confirm Jim Towey, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles to be secretary of the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.

Gardiner, who supports Armstrong, was exploring a way to bring the surgeon general before the full 40-member Senate for an up-or-down vote, although his confirmation never cleared the chamber's Ethics and Elections Committee. Twice last month, that panel scheduled hearings but never had enough votes to support his nomination.

Because of that, Senate Democrats agreed Wednesday morning that they would oppose any attempt to force a vote on Armstrong. Without their support, Armstrong's supporters do not have the two-thirds of the chamber needed to bring up a vote without Gardiner's blessing.

""I just believe if he didn't pass through the committee, then he shouldn't come to the floor,"" said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.

Braynon, who will become the Democratic leader next session, has been a vocal opponent of confirming Armstrong. He met with Gardiner Wednesday morning to tell him that the Democrats were united in opposition, and the president told him he did not intend to bring up a vote.

However, several senators have reiterated support for Armstrong.

Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, had reservations about Armstrong, but the surgeon general won his support in the Health Policy Committee after Armstrong agreed to support requests by county health departments to fill vacant positions if needed.

""I would sympathize with the governor's frustration,"" Gaetz said. ""The governor does have the right to pick his team. We may not like a person — but we only have the right to turn them down if they are unqualified or they have committed some grievous act.""

Tampa Bay Times,Dr. John Armstrong will not be confirmed as surgeon general,"It looks as though Dr. John Armstrong will no longer be the surgeon general after Friday.

Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, confirmed that he and President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, spoke this morning and that Gardiner will not bring the embattled surgeon general to the floor for a confirmation vote by the full Senate. Without that vote, Armstrong will lose his job.

Armstrong, who was appointed by Gov. Rick Scott in 2012 to run the Department of Health, has had his confirmation stuck in the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee, where he did not have the votes needed to advance to the full Senate.

All this week, Gardiner has said that he is considering whether to bring up a vote, despite Armstrong not passing through the committee. Gardiner did not confirm a conversation with Braynon but said he will discuss the issue with reporters this afternoon.

Braynon has been among those leading the charge to remove Armstrong from office following reports of rising HIV rates, shrinking county health clinics and 9,000 sick kids being removed from the state's Children's Medical Services program. But regardless of what each senator thinks, he said, it's inappropriate to bring a floor vote without the approval of the Ethics and Elections Committee.

""I just believe if he didn't pass through the committee, then he shouldn't come to the floor,"" Braynon said.

As Senate president, Gardiner can force a vote on the issue, but doing so would be an unusual move.

So, too, would be the refusal by a Republican-controlled Senate to confirm the Republican governor's nominee to run a state agency.

Tampa Bay Times,Abortion restrictions headed to Gov. Rick Scott's desk,"TALLAHASSEE — Abortion clinics won't be able to receive state money for preventive care, and they'll need privileges at a nearby hospital under a new set of restrictions that passed the Legislature on Wednesday.

State law already bans using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. But about $200,000 in Medicaid funds is spent annually on testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, cancer screenings and preventive care at abortion clinics.

Anti-abortion advocates in the Legislature assert that is tantamount to supporting abortions. Instead, they want that money to be spent in other kinds of clinics, like crisis pregnancy centers and federally qualified health centers.

""The idea that those taxpayer dollars would go to an organization that performs abortions is simply intolerable,"" Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said.

The legislation passed the Senate 25-15 and the House 76-40 on Wednesday. Gov. Rick Scott has not indicated if he'll sign it.

Beyond the Medicaid issue, advocates also maintain that tougher rules are necessary to bring abortion clinics in line with other health care facilities, like ambulatory care centers.

""This bill says we're going to treat abortion clinics the same way that we treat other similarly situated clinics,"" said Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, the bill's sponsor.

Opponents say tough new rules could lead to some clinics closing down because of requirements that doctors must have admitting privileges or transfer agreements with a nearby hospital.

And the ban on state funding, they say, would hurt women who seek preventive care, specifically at six Planned Parenthood clinics.

""If the true aim were life, this measure would not only allow but boost the funding for these clinics that provide prenatal care to mothers and babies and expand affordable health care for Floridians,"" Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, said.

The measure will likely face court challenges.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Whole Woman's Health vs. Hellerstedt, a case alleging that a Texas law with tough regulations similar to those in this bill are unconstitutional. On Friday, the court instituted an injunction to stop a law requiring physicians to have admitting privileges in Louisiana.

In Florida, a mandatory 24-hour waiting period signed into law last summer is in the middle of its own court challenge. Opponents allege that law, as well as the bill passed Wednesday, violate strict privacy provisions in the state Constitution that have been interpreted to ban any undue burdens that restrict access to abortions.

The bill was passed in the wake of controversy over videos released online appearing to show Planned Parenthood doctors in other states talking about a fetal remains donation program.

It would make tougher restrictions against improperly disposing of fetal remains. And it would change the definition of trimesters in state laws to validate state regulators' arguments in a series of complaints filed last year against Planned Parenthood.

Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, an abortion rights supporter who voted with Democrats against the new regulations, said the Legislature should stop ""nibbling around the edges"" of the abortion debate. The issue reminds her of antismoking campaigns, she said.

""Just because you took everybody's ash trays away doesn't mean they quit smoking,"" Detert said. ""Just because we make it more difficult for people to get an abortion or more expensive doesn't mean that those people who want an abortion aren't going to try to get one. They've done it historically for hundreds of years.""

Other senators, including Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Miami, the first woman elected president of the Florida Senate, called the legislation an ""outrage."" She said the Legislature continues to move abortion bills each year because it ""obviously is not a women's group.""

Tampa Bay Times,Speakers at Moffitt forum say cancer 'moonshot' will require more money,"Cancer researchers are on the verge of making significant advances that could reduce the mortality rate for people with the disease, National Cancer Institute Acting Director Douglas Lowy said Monday during a visit to Tampa's Moffitt Cancer Center.

""What we've been able to do for HIV — to take a death sentence and turn it into a disease where people who have HIV can look forward to a normal life expectancy — I think with cancer, we'll have the same opportunity,"" Lowy told a group of doctors, scientists and patients gathered for a panel discussion on cancer research.

His trip to Moffitt comes amid a renewed national effort to eradicate the disease led by Vice President Joe Biden. Moffitt's top executives have already met with Biden's staff to discuss their involvement in his so-called ""cancer moonshot,"" and are hoping to play a key role in the initiative.

""We're excited about what lies ahead,"" CEO Alan List said.

In his remarks on Monday, Lowy said the cancer mortality rate had dropped 15 percent for men and 12 percent for women since 1992, and added the number of survivors is climbing.

""This is attributable to prevention, screening and treatment,"" he said.

But Lowy conceded ""too many people still get cancer,"" and despite the recent $2 billion boost to the National Institutes of Health, almost every area of cancer research remains underfunded.

As for what's ahead, Lowy spoke to advances in immunotherapy, an approach to treatment that uses the patient's own immune system to fight the cancer, as well as precision medicine, which takes the patient's genes into account.

He also said scientists were working on vaccines that could prevent cancer, like the vaccine he helped develop to protect against cervical cancer. That vaccine has reduced the prevalence of the cancer-causing human papillomavirus (HPV) in teenage girls by about two-thirds, according to a study published last month in the journal Pediatrics.

Other speakers at the event included U.S. Reps. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, and Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, who have been working together on a proposal called the 21st Century Cures Act. The legislation, which would increase funding for the National Institutes of Health by more than $8 billion, has already won approval in the House, but has met resistance in the Senate.

Bilirakis rebuffed criticism that the measure was too costly.

""These are tough economic times,"" he said. ""We have a $19 trillion national debt. The thing is, this is a priority.""

In addition to addressing the need for the increased funding, Castor stressed the importance of educating the public about preventative measures, such as the HPV vaccine.

""We spend a lot of money and we talk a lot about finding a cure for cancer,"" she said. ""But here's a vaccine that prevents some kinds of cancer"" and some parents are resisting it, she said.

The panel discussion also featured Jacqueline Smith, a 37-year-old Moffitt patient who has twice been diagnosed with melanoma. Smith said she owes her life to a clinical trial she completed at the cancer center in 2008.

She, too, made the case for more funding.

""It's critical that the government does not just (haphazardly give out) funding, but that funding continues to grow with inflation, and that our researchers here and across the country can know that they will have predictable and sustained research funding for all of their endeavors,"" she said. ""That's critical for survivors and their families.""

Tampa Bay Times,Column: Why I support the Florida Department of Health and its surgeon general,"I read with concern the Tampa Bay Times' editorial on Friday (""Florida needs new top doctor"") in which a number of issues with state Surgeon General John Armstrong and the Department of Health's programs were noted. As a previous secretary of the Florida Department of Health from 1999 through 2001, I respectfully disagree with the editors and would like to bring to the readers' attention several important reasons why I believe the Florida Senate would be wise to reconsider its position and reconfirm Dr. Armstrong.

The role of public health programs has traditionally been to protect the people of the state and to promote health with ever-broadening responsibilities and often fewer resources, both financial and personnel, than are needed. Recent years have been no exception. As the recent outbreak of the Zika virus has shown, public health must be prepared to respond to emergencies that affect the public.

I have been impressed by how the surgeon general and the department have taken a proactive approach to minimizing the danger to the public from this disease. This same protective approach has also been taken with recent outbreaks of Ebola virus, Chikungunya virus and dengue virus, to name a few public health risks. To mobilize public health and educate Florida's public correctly requires real leadership. Changing leadership in the midst of the Zika virus outbreak — which is likely to increase before it improves — may not be wise for the state.

I have also been impressed with Armstrong's and the department's emphasis on the obesity epidemic — a major public health problem leading to countless years of life lost and hundreds of millions of dollars in costs. In recent years the surgeon general has actively led efforts across the state to bring attention and resources to this growing problem. Continuing those efforts and building on them are worthy goals of public health and the department.

The editorial also mentions the sobering statistics about the continuing HIV/AIDS epidemic in Florida. The increasing HIV rates in certain sectors of the population are certainly concerning and require increased attention. In fact, some of the increase in finding of HIV cases is exactly because Florida leads the nation in the number of HIV tests performed with more than 375,000 tests completed in 2015. It should be noted that the numbers of AIDS cases has generally been decreasing over the last 10 to 15 years, meaning those with HIV are generally living longer lives, and Florida has been recently spending more money on HIV/AIDS than ever.

The editorial mentions several other public policy issues of importance, and there is no doubt that the department still has work to do with regard to restoring the public's confidence in its ability to maximally meet the public health needs of the state.

I have known Armstrong for many years and worked with him while he was a leader before his time as surgeon general. We worked together on issues of bioterrorism after the state was rocked by anthrax in 2001, and I also saw his leadership in setting up the innovative medical and leadership programs at the University of South Florida's Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation while we were both professors at USF.

I am confident he has the vision and abilities to meet the goals of the department to promote and protect the health of the people of Florida in the coming years.

Martina found her Wimbledon crown still fit

WIMBLEDON, England —There was no coup d'etat. No changing of the guard in women's tennis. Martina Navratilova was, more than ever, Wimbledon's queen. She gave Steffi Graf a 7-5, 6-3 spanking in Saturday's finals and then, prior to leaving Centre Court, heard the 18-year-old heiress apparent wondering aloud when her day will come. ""How many do you want?"" Graf mused as the world's 1-2 players packed their tennis tools following Queen Martina's bagging of an eighth Wimbledon singles championship and a sixth in a row. ""Well,"" said the 30-year-old Navratilova, with one of her big-toothed smiles, ""nine is my lucky number.""

It's Back to the Future.

Navratilova will not be handing over her scepter to Graf as long as the Czech-turned-Texan is as physically crisp and as mentally focused as she was Saturday and as long as Steffi cannot equalize Navratilova's twisting grass-court serve.

At last, Doug Williams has his day

SAN DIEGO — John Elway, the 43rd white quarterback to start a Super Bowl game, came out like Mike Tyson. Boom! One play. Eight seconds. ""Boss Bronco"" slugged Washington in its capital jaw, a 56-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Nattiel. Orange you impressed?

But from the frantic dust of Sunday's first half would ride a quarterback of a different color. A tough black man; and let's put the emphasis on tough, and on man, rather than on black.

In the beginning, Doug Williams' dream took some nightmarish twists. His D.C. amigos, despite good throws by Williams, were finding it more blessed to drop than to receive.

Denver appeared on the verge of manslaughter. The Elway magic, mixed with creative play calling by the Broncos, amassed a quick 10-0 lead. Then, as the 'Skins were returning a kickoff, Ricky Sanders fumbled.

There, things turned.

For The Longest Minute, sweaty supermen fought, scratched and bled in search of that loose football. Finally, Denver players jumped up, signaling they had recovered. But there was a higher court; officials pointed Washington's way.

A turn not to be forgotten.

Instead of the orange shirts scoring again, amassing a 17-0 lead, that combative and critical moment at the Washington 16-yard line was a wake-up call for the Redskins.

Williams completed a 40-yard throw to Art Monk. But then, in front of a world TV audience of 300-million, the continuing soap opera - Life with Doug - had a wincing, painful act.

Twenty-four hours before Super Bowl kickoff, Williams had undergone root-canal surgery. But, with 1:37 to go in the first quarter, there was a different kind of hurt.

Trying to pass, his right foot slipped on the loose grass of Jack Murphy Stadium. The left knee was hyperflexed. Williams got up, then fell down again.

He limped off the field.

Right there, the Williams' dream seemed blunted. Would he be stripped of the chance to become the Super Bowl's first winning black QB with the emphasis on winning?

You know the answer.

Williams was gone for just two plays. Any longer, and Redskins coach Joe Gibbs would have had to chain Doug to the bench. The dream, instead of dying, came to Herculean life.

Never has any quarterback - white, black, brown or yellow - had a Super Bowl quarter like Williams' second period against Denver. Four touchdowns, and 243 yards, in 15 minutes.

Rose merits Hall for hits, not errors

Three years from now, Pete Rose's face — even with its hobgoblin wrinkles — should be sculpted onto a plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Even if thorny rumors become substantiated fact, and Rose is ejected from the game that has been his life, No. 14 from Cincinnati still deserves a fair trial for Cooperstown. Rose, on ballfield bravado alone, should ride a first-ballot landslide into the Hall of Fame. Far as I know, Cooperstown's electorate has not been commissioned to evaluate moral fiber. If Rose is convicted of illegal sports gambling, and Hall jurors immediately blackball him, I suggest circulating petitions to reopen the cases of Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and others.

Cobb held the record for career hits until the puckish, persistent Pete came along. Prior to World War I, Tyrus R. Cobb was a skilled, swift and downright nasty outfielder with the Detroit Tigers. His middle name, instead of being Raymond, could well have been Redneck.

""A dreadful person,"" the late Bill Terry, a Hall of Fame first baseman, once told me. ""Cobb made me ashamed,"" Terry said, ""to be a fellow Southerner. He wouldn't get into taxis driven by black men. I never knew anybody who truly and deeply liked Ty.""

But Cobb is immortalized in Cooperstown.

Oct. 18, 1989, Mizell was covering the World Series when a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay area

A frightening reminder of the power of nature

SAN FRANCISCO — This was the World Serious. An earthquake hit, and baseball was jarred from the mind. It scared me. Really scared me. Anyone who wasn't must be brain-dead.

Thirty minutes before Game 3 of the World Series was to start, Candlestick Park began to shake like a bad dream. Light towers wavered.

Stress fractures occurred in the superstructure.

Strangely, fans by the thousands began to cheer and laugh. Were they pretending some weird kind of bravado, as if this were just another quiver for Californians who consider themselves earthquake ""old pros.""

Minutes later, the levity subsided. Over battery-powered radios came word that the Bay Bridge was crumbling, and fires were scorching Berkeley, Oakland and downtown San Francisco.

Lights went out at Candlestick. Screams replaced the laughter, except among a few drunks who, I must presume, would've celebrated the sinking of the Titanic with a beer party.

Twice before, while covering sports events in California, I had experienced earthquakes. The first in 1979, while listening to Johnny Carson's monologue at a Tonight Show taping during Super Bowl week.

Then just last summer, during the National Basketball Association finals.

But nothing like this.

I was in a media work room, having popcorn while awaiting the first pitch. Wondering if the San Francisco Giants could somehow win Game 3, cutting into the Oakland A's two-upsmanship.

The room began to tremble. TV sets moved. It got dark. Being from Florida, I'm somewhat hurricane-ready. But nothing prepared me for this. I hit the floor, and nuzzled up to the nearest wall.

It lasted 15 seconds. It seemed like 45 minutes. A woman screamed.

She was alone in a dark, shaking bathroom. If you think that is funny, you weren't there.

…

This was 1989, not 1906, but that didn't slow my heartbeat or calm the nerves. Fifty minutes after the quake, as I sat on a folding chair trying to write this column before the daylight was gone, police came and said, ""Get out now!"" No negotiation. I packed up, but didn't go far.

Just outside the ballpark, ABC-TV trucks were parked. An area now lit by lights connected to the network's portable generators. I parked my computer atop an ABC trunk and began tapping away.

Then, another noise. I ducked before thinking. Felt a little silly when it was an airliner buzzing overhead, having just taken off from nearby San Francisco International Airport.

People began driving home, avoiding the Bay Bridge where problems were so apparent.

This story was written on a small, portable computer. It hooks into a telephone and transmits to the St. Petersburg Times' main computer.

When I was ready to transmit, there was no phone. ABC-TV helped me.

We found one in a trailer. But there was no electricity. I sent the story while a television executive held a penlight flashlight on my machine.

An experience.

Seventeen years ago, while on a seemingly harmless sports-journalism assignment, I suddenly found myself writing about people being gunned down by terrorists at the Munich Olympics.

That was the worst. But, an October Tuesday in San Francisco became a distant No. 2 fear in this strange thing I call a career.

I'm fine. Most of the 2-million are unharmed. But when we are occasionally reminded of what force nature can amass, mere athletic events are as insignificant as an ant scaling an elephant's back.

I was scared.

To not admit that would be ridiculous. ...

Ashe news is rotten and unfair

We were floored by Magic Johnson's announcement, even if his infection was self-inflicted. My stomach ached over the fall of the world's greatest basketball player, a young man with such an accommodating nature and wonderful smile, and a championship role model.

What Magic did to get the HIV virus was not heroic. My heart still went out. There is much to admire in the considerable courage with which Earvin Johnson has faced his destiny, and he deserves loud applause for his subsequent appeals on the prevention of AIDS and the stalking of a cure.

But the news of Arthur Ashe is more unfair. His case is due not to sexual activity or sharing drug paraphernalia _ the two leading ways the AIDS virus is transmitted. Ashe is a victim of a medical procedure.

Ashe was an extraordinary tennis player. Not as good at his game as Magic Johnson was at his, but nonetheless an athlete of indelible global impact. Ashe was the first black man to win a Grand Slam tournament, the unforgettable Wimbledon of 1975 when the skinny Virginian put away Jimmy Connors.

I got to know Arthur in 1982, my first summer of going to England to write about Wimbledon. Ashe was no longer playing, but still he impressed. Arthur was wearing a media badge, doing television commentary for HBO and writing a tennis column for the Washington Post.

No ordinary jock.

""For 10 years, I was the Post editor assigned to handle Ashe's copy,"" said Leonard Shapiro, who Wednesday was here in Augusta preparing to cover the Masters. ""Arthur is so good as a writer that I seldom had to put a pencil to his words.""

Most athletic figures who allegedly write books, or magazine or newspaper articles, never spend a minute at a keyboard. Frequently, a jock gabs into a tape recorder, and then a ghost writer transforms _ and often enriches _ the athlete's thoughts before turning them into print.

Ashe needs no such help.

He's always been a campaigner, in tennis and beyond. Twenty years ago, Ashe spoke out against apartheid, and in 1968 lobbied for the United States to pressure South Africa. His demeanor is characteristically quiet, and his oratory a voice of reason. Except for once, a generation ago, when Arthur suggested, ""They should drop a bomb on Johannesburg.""

Four years ago, in Wimbledon's press room, Ashe said he felt lousy. An uncharacteristic statement. When Arthur errs, it's usually in the direction of optimism. ""This could be my last Wimbledon,"" he said. We assumed it was his long-troubled heart. Although Ashe has returned to London each summer since, we now know that 1988 was the year HIV first appeared.

I feel rotten.

Spurrier saves ace for 'Bama

TALLAHASSEE — At halftime, Steve Spurrier saw his Florida Gators as football-dead. It was already a 38-17 killing. FSU was guilty, and giddy. Doak Campbell Stadium was chanting, and tomahawk-chopping. Spurrier decided to pull the plug, by pulling his quarterback.

Marvin Jones immediately saw he wouldn't have Shane Matthews to kick around any longer. ""Right there, I thought to myself,"" said Florida State's lethal linebacker, """"They've given up.'""

Surrender was not unanimous.

Matthews, all-time SEC passing king and twice MVP of his conference, would admit to disagreement with his benching. But being a Mississippi coach's son, and a good Gator soldier, the senior quarterback didn't complain.

""Coach Spurrier knows best,"" he said.

Florida's wheeler-dealer, in playing his Saturday cards, looked ahead to the next hand. Ahead to next week, and a more coveted Spurrier-Matthews opportunity, against Alabama (11-0) in the Southeastern Conference Championship Game.

Spurrier's decision was practical, and I semi-understand. Florida wasn't going to catch the Seminoles even if Dan Marino quarterbacked the Gators in the second half.

But what Spurrier did goes against the never-say-die, sis-boom-bah, old-school-try grain. He'll take some heat. But I'll not chastise the Gator coach for doing what could well wind up being in the best interest of his 1992 season.

""FSU was clearly too good for us,"" Spurrier said, Saturday's 45-24 final aglow on the Doak Campbell Stadium scoreboard. ""Shane was banged up a bit, and I decided it was a good time to let Terry Dean get some QB experience. We did get a (7-7) standoff in the second half.""

Hot air was rising.

Bucs' sad story gets even worse

If you thought the Bucs, who always seem to be succeeding themselves as the NFL's most inept franchise, couldn't possibly get worse ...well, your mind was too sporting to conjure up Sunday's pitiful Tampa Bay script against the Green Bay Packers.

A 37-14 loss was misleading.

It was far more lopsided. Far more Tampa Bay hopeless. What really counted, and truly pained Tampa Stadium patrons deep into another season of shortfall, was mental/physical Bucs bungling that made it easy for Green Bay to breeze ahead 30-0.

By then, two-thirds of the crowd was booing, the rest celebrating. Depended on point of view. Ten thousand Packers fans _ mostly Wisconsin-to-Florida transplants _ viewed the Bucs as enjoyable comedy. But for 38,000 locals, it was just one more NFL tragedy on Dale Mabry. By halftime, Green Bay led 24-0 and 40 percent of the house was rushing for exits.

They'd seen enough.

Craig Erickson had thrown two Bucs interceptions, Tampa Bay rookie receiver Lamar Thomas had muffed two simple first-down passes, Bucs backup quarterback Steve DeBerg also had been too fruitless and Green Bay receiving whiz Sterling Sharpe was too often suckering the home team's defensive backs for touchdowns.

DeBerg, the Bucs' 39-year-old pitcher, came in from coach Sam Wyche's bullpen to relieve Erickson. That was futile. DeBerg had about as much success with the Packers as Mitch Williams, the flammable Philadelphia fireman, had against Toronto in the World Series. Steve was a 4-for-11 thrower for 30 yards.

So what's the good news?

Tampa Bay's two biggest first-half offensive plays were crafty old pro DeBerg using a tricky snap count to draw defenders offside. For a mini-moment, it seemed the Bucs were about to make a big second-quarter play. Tight end Ron Hall got open over the middle. DeBerg threw, was preparing to grin, but then he frowned as Green Bay linebacker Johnny Holland flashed into the picture and intercepted.

You get the idea.

Selmon fits in perfectly with greats

CANTON, Ohio — Just beyond the Professional Football Hall of Fame's ticket window, where Thursday's worshipers were paying $7 a head to browse among the game's history and legends, I did a pudgy middle-aged juke to the right of the 7-foot bronze statue that honors Jim Thorpe.

There he was. Our guy. First sight of Tampa Bay's hero in the Hall. Biggest winner from the NFL's losingest franchise. Lee Roy Selmon's smiling but humble photograph Thursday graced a lobby wall where he was being honored along with Kellen Winslow, Steve Largent, Jim Finks and Henry Jordan as the Hall of Fame's Class of 1995.

""Lee Roy, the one and only Buc,"" a tourist in baggy shorts and unlaced sneakers whispered with reverence to his college-age daughter. ""Tampa Bay's always been a lousy team, but, my dear, that Selmon was some player.""

Silently, I agreed, having seen Selmon's athletic grandeur and personal grace through nine Bucs seasons. Their regular- and post-season record in the Lee Roy Years was 45-91-1. But, as predominantly and collectively unsuccessful as those Bucs were, Lee Roy tends to trumpet the rare sweet times _ such as 1979, when Tampa Bay made the NFC Championship Game, and 1981, when Selmon's guys won the NFC Central Division a second time.

In any company, he was extraordinary.

Saturday here in Canton, where the National Football League was chartered 75 years ago, Selmon and classmates Finks, Largent, Jordan and Winslow are to be moved upstairs from that Hall of Fame lobby to be bronzed and granted new status and new immortality. Heading for a more permanent Canton wall where their busts are to rest forever among those of Halas, Nagurski, Graham, Rozelle, Brown, Lombardi, Grange and 168 others.

April 1, 1998, after the Tampa Bay Devil Rays first regular season game at Tropicana Field

At long last, baseball makes its entrance

Fruition.

They lost, badly. But they played. Good. Twenty years. How many times, during an oft-turbulent Tampa Bay journey, did we think our eyes might never see March 31, 1998? Baseball full house. A creation christened as the Devil Rays. A team to call our own.

Tuesday was immediately soaked with greatness. Ted Williams, Stan Musial, Monte Irvin and Al Lopez. Old men now, but fabulous historic practitioners of the game. Hall of Famers, here to flick a soft barrage of ceremonial first pitches.

Fred McGriff, Wade Boggs, Dave Martinez and Bubba Trammell brought leather to catch the throws of giants. Wealthy moderns who would ask autographs from Ted, Stan, Monte and Al. From those icons, any of the Devil Rays could get so much more.

If this team, Tampa Bay's own, ever plays with talent approaching that of The Thumper, if it can evolve into competitors with The Man's zeal, there are joyous times ahead at The Trop.

Just to see 3/31/98 The Devil Rays are 0-1. Detroit boomed ahead 11-0, but the Tigers would be mildly staggered by the rallying Rays before putting away an 11-6 opener. May I make a guarantee? Tampa Bay's baseball team will not go 0-26. Your Rays will not be the reincarnation of your baby NFL Bucs of 1976-77.

Win tonight ... they're .500.

Baseball works that way.

I'm still applauding St. Petersburg's uncharacteristically gutsy civic act of building the dome. Still glad my town decided to bet on the come. Still happy we didn't listen to Peter Ueberroth, the naysayer, then commissioner of baseball.

It was a zesty 86 degrees as patrons jammed through gates for a 5:05 first pitch. Not yet April. Wait until it's July, August and September. Say thanks we're smarter than Miami. More understanding of Florida's spring and summer weather quirks than the Marlins. Let them sweat in Pro Players Sauna. Let them soak. Let them suffer.

Dome is the Florida deal.

Not traditional, but sensible.

Tropicana Field cost more than it should have. Surely, it took longer to furnish with a franchise than it might have. But, finally to see legitimate, in-our-house American League baseball on 3/31/98, being among a sellout gathering of 45,369, there was invigorating closure. Even if the Detroit Tigers batters were abusing Tampa Bay pitchers.

The Trop was smacked with some deserved licks from critics in the weeks leading to 3/31/98. There were ugly miscues during college basketball's NCAA South Regional. But that, like Tampa Bay's terribly long chase of Major League Baseball, is finished now. Most of what I saw Tuesday night was beyond good.

Good array of P.A. music, not as disgustingly loud as in NBA arenas. Nice message boards. Solid scoreboards, including results on all other major league games. Huge and handsome Mitsubishi video screen. Also, within dome reason, the look of a baseball park.

More important than anything, at last we were playing. Not searching. Not scrapping. Has anybody forgotten the highs, when Tampa Bay thought the White Sox were about to become our ballclub, to be followed by piercing lows as the possibility evaporated?

Emotions agonizingly similar when the Mariners almost relocated to St. Petersburg, then the Giants. Also the Rangers. Did I mention the Twins? Surely there were others.

But, at last, we have the Rays.

His last regular column that was printed May 18, 2001.

A wide-ranging wish list for the Tampa Bay area

This is my final column.

Although for at least three years, beginning June 3, I am to write Sunday commentaries in Times sports. An opportunity highly appreciated, a transition that will ease possibilities of the bends as an old sports writer decompresses after 40 full-bore years in a most honorable, challenging, rewarding profession.

Packing to go, headed for a Virginia valley just across Wintergreen mountain from the Shenandoah, excited about a new life and new weather and new geography, may I leave a little list with you ... things I'd love to see when coming back to visit Florida.

• Rays out of turmoil, in contention, playing to packed and happy houses at Tropicana Field.

• Bucs in the Super Bowl, with a renowned Tony Dungy, an accomplished Brad Johnson, a fulfilled Keyshawn Johnson, the same old tough John Lynch, plus a Warren Sapp who has opted to deliver in the community with the zeal and personality always evident in his play.

• Ybor City a more fun, fuller, safer attraction than ever.

• Professional, authoritative, low-trash, high-character, non-juvenile Tampa Bay sports talk. I might have a better chance of putting up a buck and hitting the Lotto.

• Wilson Alvarez: 21-6 (2.37).

• A wealth of open, bright, wide-ranging community minds that allows optimum growth for an area that has wasted far too much time being divided, provincial and negative about consolidated possibilities.

• A sold-out, roaring Ice Palace where the Lightning has become absolute challenger to the Blues, Devils, Pens, Avs and all other Stanley Cup stalkers.

• Scalpers at the Trop.

• USF football and basketball well into admirable, challenging steps in search of major NCAA conquests, having become so locally magnetic that even the students are massively interested in overpopulating arenas.

• A return of wondrous NBA fury in Orlando, surpassing even the Shaq 'n Penny period, blending the skills of McGrady, Hill, Miller and associates into an Orlando pride not connected to theme parks.

• BayWalk booming.

• National championship college football playoffs a reality, with semifinals played at Raymond James and the Citrus Bowl, one matching the 'Noles and 'Canes, with the Gators and Bulls in the other. Hey, as long as I'm asking, why stretch for anything but the optimum?

• Vince Naimoli having some real fun, expending his athletic energies on Notre Dame football.

• A busy, engaging downtown St. Petersburg business strip so extensive and successful, it lavishly marries the dome on 16th Street with The Pier and BayWalk.

• A completed six-lane, comparatively enjoyable Interstate 4 connection of Tampa and Orlando.

• A local TV station, or two or three, doing something revolutionarily retro -- identifying and presenting solid news and timely features, offering commentators with strong credibility, with a No. 1 goal of keeping viewers abreast of subjects that interest the most people, rather than worrying so much about competing for Cutie of the Year.

• Fourth Street in St. Petersburg with an Outback, Sam's Club, Barnes & Noble and one less bank.

• Bucs practice facility, for which Ray-J bonds provided $12-million, finally getting built. I keep wondering, as Glazers keep refining plans, if there might be a fourth son on the way, necessitating another boss office.

• Hal McRae winning.

• Women's basketball at USF without the travails, pains, ugliness, racial overtones and institutional embarrassments; amply replaced by athletes trying their hardest and overwhelmingly enjoying the ride.

• Bustling, wall-to-wall, big-time success for the always promising downtown Tampa complex that encompasses the bay area's most imposing business area plus Harbour Island, the Ice Palace, cruise port, aquarium and glistening new hotels.

• John McKay healthy again.

• Seeing my old friends happy, my old newspaper colleagues flourishing, my only kid happy and well off, my old town feeling better about itself than ever, with my old area having become fully and legitimately big league.

• Considerable numbers of terrific old neighbors who haven't totally forgotten the Mizell fellow, who for roughly 10,000 days tried to do his best at relaying sports news, analyzing and having a bit of fun along the way.

June 6, 2011, from a column about the death of Tampa Tribune sports editor Tom McEwen

Fond farewell, my friendly foe

For 27 years, we were competitors. Tom McEwen was the sports voice, indeed the town crier, for the Tampa Tribune. I wrote a sports column for the St. Petersburg Times. My newspaper was always larger, but my friend Tom tended to ""diminish"" when glancing west across Tampa Bay. To his eyes, nothing was bigger or brighter than what he called ""My Tampa.""

We butted heads on a multitude of issues, like ""Who should be USF's first football coach?"" and ""Where should a stadium be built for a Tampa Bay major-league baseball team?"" Beginning in 1976, we traveled the NFL shoulder to shoulder, delivering ink that was stained with pain and love and occasional sarcasm. Chronicling setbacks and searching for cures as the Buccaneers of coach John McKaywobbled through an 0-26 beginning.

When word came of McEwen's death early Sunday, I winced as though it was a beloved family member that I'd be seeing no more. Joking with no more. Trading chides with no more.

Competing with no more. As ravenous as Tom and I were to get major stories for our newspapers, and get them first, we were also each other's best counsel.",03/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,'Soul-searching' Gardiner may let full Senate set Armstrong's fate,"Senate President Andy Gardiner is changing his tune on Dr. John Armstrong, the state surgeon general whose confirmation is stuck in a Senate panel assigned to vet his performance for the job.

""The reality is he's one vote short, and everybody can count,"" Gardiner told reporters Wednesday, referring to Armstrong's failure to win a majority in the 10-member Ethics and Elections Committee.

Leading Senate Republicans have stood by Armstrong even as some of their members joined ranks with Democrats to block the confirmation of the surgeon general, an appointee of Gov. Rick Scott, who has to be approved by next Friday.

Gardiner can choose to skip over Ethics and Elections, bringing Armstrong to a vote by the entire 40-member body, but it would be an unusual move.

And it would be a dramatic shift from a Senate president who earlier this session said he would not bend the rules for any of Scott's appointees. ""They will have to go through Ethics and Elections,"" he said then.

""I try to be consistent,"" Gardiner said Wednesday. ""I've stood here before you guys and said I would not pull somebody out of Ethics and Elections, and I've got some real soul-searching to do to decide, should the entire Senate have a say on Dr. Armstrong? I may be coming back to you guys and saying, 'I changed my mind.' I just don't know yet.""

Gardiner says he does not know what the vote in the full Senate would be, but it appears Armstrong could be confirmed. There are 26 Republicans in the Florida Senate, and it would take 20 votes to confirm the surgeon general. Only one Republican has voted against him and two have voiced concerns in the committee process but ultimatley supported Armstrong.

The confirmation process has been a tough road for Armstrong, even as other gubernatorial appointees were swiftly confirmed. He has been criticized for Department of Health policies that cut 9,000 kids from the Children's Medical Services program, eliminated quality standards for children's heart surgery, slowed the rollout of medical marijuana and led to cutbacks in county health clinics.

His department has also been blamed for not doing more to combat HIV, which is growing faster in this state than any other in the country and particularly in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which lead the nation for infection rates.",03/03/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Florida needs new surgeon general,"There is no reason the Florida Senate should confirm Dr. John Armstrong as the state's surgeon general. As disappointing as the rejection would be for this former Army surgeon and the person who appointed him, Gov. Rick Scott, Armstrong has not demonstrated the independence or urgency needed in this position. Florida's Department of Health needs a new, permanent leader who has the confidence of the legislative branch and the public — and the governor needs to get the message that the state's chief health advocate works for all Floridians.

Senators again postponed a confirmation vote this week, in what may have been Armstrong's last chance to keep his job. With no more meetings scheduled of the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee before the session's scheduled end March 11, it would take a change of heart by one of Armstrong's Senate opponents or an extraordinary move by the chamber's leadership to get the confirmation on track. Neither should happen.

Armstrong appeared to be an inspiring choice in 2012. As a former top medical officer at the University of South Florida, the Princeton-educated trauma surgeon had experience in both academic and clinical settings. His time in the public sector should have prepared him well to be an effective advocate in addressing the evolving public health threats of the times.

But Armstrong has not been a strong voice when Floridians needed it. Last year, the Senate Health Policy Committee chose not to confirm him after Armstrong refused to give his opinion on the Senate's plan to accept federal Medicaid expansion money — just one day after Scott reversed himself and said he no longer supported accepting the money because he did not trust the federal government. Armstrong also wrote an inflammatory letter to federal officials in 2014 raising suspicions that children fleeing the humanitarian crisis in Latin America were posing health risks to Floridians — a nakedly political signal in keeping with the Scott administration's anti-immigrant bent.

Under Armstrong's watch, HIV rates soared in Florida to the highest point since 2002. At the same time, state leaders steadily cut the Health Department's budget, and nonprofit safety net hospitals were continually under attack by the Scott administration. Armstrong has also been under fire for his department's removal of about 9,000 children from a program serving the state's sickest kids, and for moving to repeal rules governing operating standards for pediatric heart facilities.

Armstrong has strongly defended the need for measles vaccinations, helping to debunk the politically charged fears over invalid claims of a link between the vaccines and autism. Scott's office — in hoping to salvage the nomination — has also worked hard the past few months to paint Armstrong as proactive.

But these are public relations efforts. A state with problems as rampant and diverse as obesity, asthma, HIV, polluted drinking water and other issues provides ample opportunity for a surgeon general to make a mark. For all his skill sets, Armstrong has not been a forceful public advocate. That may be the governor's fault, but it's the Senate's responsibility now to address.

Tampa Bay Times,Legislature passes HIV prevention project to allow for needle exchange for addicts,"Determined to reduce the spiraling number of new HIV infections in South Florida, the Florida House sent a bill to the governor Wednesday that will create a pilot program in Miami-Dade County to allow drug addicts to exchange their dirty needles for free, clean needles and syringes.

For four years. Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, sponsored the bill but he could never get it through both the House and Senate. But this year — with blood-borne diseases among intravenous drug users rising in Florida — he and House sponsor, Rep. Katie Edwards, D-Plantation, were able to win bi-partisan support for the idea.

The state leads the nation for new cases of HIV/AIDS with the number of infections rising each year, even as it drops nationwide. The infections have risen as heroin use has exploded while the size of county health departments have been shrinking under Gov. Rick Scott and the state’s top health officer, Dr. John Armstrong, who have made it a policy to cut programming and personnel at the Department of Health.

The HIV epidemic is most severe in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which have the highest rates of new infections per 100,000 residents of any area in the country, according to state and federal data. A study done at Jackson Memorial found that the cost of treating patients with bacterial infections as a result of dirty needles is about $11.4 million a year.

The program will be run through the University of Miami, which will be allowed to circumvent the state's drug paraphernalia laws to use a mobile unit that attempts to reach addicts to encourage them to replace their dirty needles for clean ones. The university is responsible for securing funding through grants and donations so there is no cost to state taxpayers.

The program will also distribute information that directs people to drug treatment and counseling programs and makes educational materials available. The House voted 95-20 for SB 242, which had cleared the Senate 37-2.

Braynon said ""it took a while for us to get people to understand what this program did."" Opponents argued that the program could make it easier for addicts to get access to drugs but proponents said but the main goal of the program is to prevent the transmission of HIV, AIDS, viral hepatitis, or other blood-borne diseases by offering addicts clean needles, not to treat addiction.

Rep. Michael Bileca, R-Miami, was the only lawmaker to speak against the bill Wednesday. He said he had read many studies about effective needle exchange programs and objected to the provision that allows the needle exchange to occur through a mobile unit, and not at a fixed site where addicts could be encouraged to get counseling and treatment.

But Rep. Julio Gonzalez, a conservative Republican from Naples who is an orthopedic surgeon, countered that anyone who understands addicts realizes ""their world is a very, very horrible place"" and they are often unable to ""leave that world to go someplace else to go get a needle to protect themselves.""

He said he treated HIV patients at Jackson Memorial who ""have a glazed look because of the effects of medications"" and saw people who were so afflicted with their ""GI tracts were so riddled with infection"" they couldn't digest food. Their veins were so damaged by their intravenous drug use, medical personnel could not find a vein, forcing them to ask patients to insert their own IVs, he said.

""This is a very palpable, very real, very threatening disorder that threatens not only the lives of people that are affect but their families, their communities, our budget,"" he said.

Edwards noted that the bill does include a requirement that the program refer addicts to drug abuse treatment, counseling and prevention programs and gives the university the flexibility ""to employ mobile units to locations where they know they will reach the highest population of addicts.""

Dr. Hansel Tookes, a resident physician of internal medicine at Jackson Memorial Hospital, who treats HIV patients, first brought the idea of needle exchange to Braynon.

""This all came about because we were seeing more and more people entering the hospital with [bacteria-related infections] and they studied the cost of treating those patients at Jackson in a year and found it was $11.4 million in cost to the public health care system,'' he said. ""If we can decrease any HIV cases in Miami, we've done the community a service.""

He cited the experience of Scott County, Indiana, which saw an explosion of 140 HIV diagnoses tied to drug use in just a few months, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency and launch a needle exchange program.

""There are well over 10 thousands of injection-drug users and that number is just going up,'' he said. ""So before the perfect storm happens where we have a situation like Indiana, I'm really happy we're able to bring back this proven, evidence-based public health effort to prevent an epidemic of unknown proportions.""

Several legislators from both parties indicated they would like to expand the pilot program in the future to go beyond Miami-Dade.

""The issue we have of addiction and AIDS is not only a Miami-Dade issue, it's a Florida issue,'' Braynon said. ""This is just the beginning.""",02/03/2016

Tampa Bay Times,Lawsuit claims Tampa General Hospital divulged woman's HIV status without her consent,"A Florida woman is suing Tampa General Hospital, saying hospital employees violated her privacy by unlawfully disclosing her HIV status to her family.

The woman, who was not identified in the lawsuit, was admitted to the hospital as a maternal patient in December 2014. During her stay, a nurse mentioned she was HIV positive in front of her adult daughter, her attorneys said.

""Prior to this wrongful disclosure, (the) daughter was unaware of her mother's HIV-positive status,"" the attorneys wrote in the complaint, which was filed earlier this month in Hillsborough Circuit Court.

It happened again one month later, when the woman's newborn daughter was dying in the hospital.

A spokesman for Tampa General Hospital declined to comment on the lawsuit. But the woman's attorneys say the hospital broke a state law that protects the privacy of people who take HIV tests.

Under Florida law, ""no person to whom the results of a test have been disclosed may disclose the test results to another person.""

During the woman's initial admission to Tampa General, she made it clear ""she did not want her medical status (HIV positive) disclosed to anyone outside of her health care providers,"" according to the suit.

""This request was not honored,"" her attorneys wrote.

When her personal information was disclosed for a second time, the woman's newborn daughter was dying of non-HIV-related surgical complications.

As the woman held the baby ""for the first and last time,"" hospital employees held a speakerphone call with organ transplant personnel to discuss the possible donation of the infant's organs, according to the suit, which seeks an undisclosed amount.

""During the course of the conversation, Tampa General Hospital, nurses and the organ transplant persons discussed extensively that the infant child could not be an organ donor as her mother was HIV positive,"" her attorneys wrote.

It was loud enough for her family members in the hallway and other hospital employees to hear, they said.

The woman suffered ""grave damages"" when her private medical information was disclosed, including ""emotional distress,"" her attorneys said.

The unlawful disclosure of HIV test results could also pose a public health threat, they added.

""The Legislature has specifically found and pronounced that the public health will be served by facilitating informed, voluntary and confidential use of tests designed to detect human immunodeficiency virus infection,"" they wrote.

Tampa Bay Times,CDC: 1 in 2 black gay men in U.S. will be diagnosed with HIV,"NEW YORK — About half of gay and bisexual black men will be diagnosed with the virus that causes AIDS in their lifetime, according to new government estimates.

Overall, for the average American, the odds of an HIV infection is 1 in 99 and has been declining.

But the risk varies widely for different groups. For example, the projection is 1 in 2 for gay black men but fewer than 1 in 2,500 for heterosexual white men.

""The differences are stark,"" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC released the estimates at a Boston medical conference on Tuesday.

HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is spread mainly through sex and sharing needles for injecting drugs. In the United States, infections have long been most common in men who have sex with men. Since AIDS was first identified more than 30 years ago, medicines have changed it from a death sentence to a chronic threat.

The report provides an unusually vivid picture of what's been happening with HIV infections. The estimates were calculated from HIV diagnosis and death figures from 2009 through 2013.

New HIV infections have been falling in the United States, to about 40,000 annually. A disproportionately large share — about 10,000 cases — has been in gay and bisexual black men. That number has been holding steady while infections in other groups have fallen.

The lifetime risk of HIV has also has been declining. Several years ago, the CDC put that estimate at less than 1 in 78 for all Americans. It fell about 20 percent, to 1 in 99, and dropped for both men and women. That suggests prevention efforts are paying off, Mermin said.

The earlier estimate was based on 33 states; the new report covers all 50 states and the District of Columbia. That allowed the agency — for the first time — to calculate lifetime risk for specific groups, like gay black men, and for states.",24/02/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Senate passes Miami-Dade needle exchange program,"The Florida Senate on Wednesday voted to create a needle exchange program in Miami-Dade County, which supporters say will curb the spread of HIV.

The proposal (SB 242) allows the University of Miami to establish a needle exchange, which would otherwise be illegal under the state's drug paraphernalia laws. No taxpayer mooney could be used for the program.

Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, has been pushing the program for four years, and it is supported by medical groups, which say allowing drug users to exchange dirty needles for clean ones will help combat HIV in South Florida. Miami-Dade County leads the nation for new cases of the disease per 100,000 residents, and Florida has more new infections than any other state.

In the Senate Wednesday, the program passed swiftly on a 37-2 vote.

The House version of the bill (HB 81) is ready to be taken up by that chamber, which has never passed the program before. But new language that requires the program to direct people to drug treatment options and make educational materials available brought in new supporters. Among them were conservative Republican lawmakers who once viewed a needle exchange as a tacit approval of drug use and the state's surgeon general, Dr. John Armstrong.",24/02/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Senate panel postpones confirmation vote on Surgeon General John Armstrong,"TALLAHASSEE — With his confirmation on shaky ground, Senate leaders Tuesday pulled a vote on whether Dr. John Armstrong, Florida's surgeon general, should keep his job.

Armstrong needs the support of six members of the Senate's 10-member Ethics and Elections Committee to remain the state's top doctor and secretary of the Department of Health. Four Democrats and Republican Sen. Anitere Flores of Miami planned to vote against him.

""The surgeon general should be someone that has a strong commitment to public health,"" Flores said. ""And there have been a series of issues that perhaps question what that commitment to public health is.""

Before he was appointed by Gov. Rick Scott in 2012, Armstrong was a hospital executive at the University of South Florida. He was one of several Scott appointees not confirmed last year after relations between the governor and Senate broke down over Medicaid expansion. If he isn't confirmed by the chamber this year, he will lose his $141,000-a-year job.

Armstrong has faced tough criticism over the past year for health department policies that removed sick kids from the Children's Medical Services program and repealed pediatric heart surgery standards, as well as his agency's handling of licenses for medical marijuana growers.

What most worries Flores are the county health clinics, where staffs have been cut back and patient visits declined. Armstrong said many patients now receive care from other health centers, but Flores said he hasn't sent her data she requested to confirm that.

This trend has accompanied increases in the number of new HIV/AIDS cases in Florida, particularly in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.

""If the questions that I have are answered in a satisfactory way, I would be happy to move in favor of his approval,"" Flores said.

With Armstrong's job clearly in danger, Scott dispatched his legislative affairs director, Kim McDougal, to talk to Democrats on the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee. But all four of them are expected to oppose Armstrong.

That's a sure sign of worry by a Republican governor in dealing with a Senate committee made up of six Republicans and four Democrats.

Part of Armstrong's problem is that he has apparently not built much of a reservoir of goodwill with legislators, several of whom have been unwilling to give him the benefit of the doubt on issues like the cutbacks in county health departments.

The panel's chairman, Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, said the committee will meet once more next week, but he said Armstrong faces a ""steep uphill climb"" to win enough votes to keep his job.

""Some of the members of the committee still have some questions outstanding and they want to circle around with the surgeon general,"" Richter said. He identified two senators in particular, Flores and Democrat Chris Smith of Fort Lauderdale.

Armstrong is happy to meet with senators who have questions and looks forward to his hearing, DOH spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said.

Richter said the postponement is not a politically motivated attack on Scott. ""This is not about the governor. This is about the surgeon general,"" Richter said.

In the same committee meeting, two of Scott's other agency appointees — Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Cissy Proctor and Lottery Secretary Tom Delacenserie — breezed through confirmation.

Asked to predict whether Armstrong will keep his job, Richter said: ""I hope so.""

Tampa Bay Times,Senate panel postpones confirmation of Dr. John Armstrong as surgeon general,"A confirmation hearing for Dr. John Armstrong, the state's surgeon general, was delayed Tuesday after there weren't enough votes on the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee to let him keep his job.

With four Democrats and Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, poised to vote against Armstrong Ethics and Elections Chairman Garrett Richter, R-Naples, pulled the state's top doctor and secretary of the Department of Health off the day's agenda.

Flores was the only Republican to vote against Armstrong in his first hearing in the Health Policy Committee last week. Since then, she said she hasn't received adequate answers to questions about reductions in county health departments. On Armstrong's watch, the county health clinics have seen a reduction in staffing as well as the number of patient visits. Armstrong said those patients are now going to other charitable health centers, but Flores said he hasn't sent her data she requested to confirm that.

""Overall, what we want to see is the surgeon general should be someone that has a strong commitment to public health,"" Flores said. ""And there have been a series of issues that perhaps question what that commitment to public health is.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Vaginal ring, drug cut rates of HIV in Africa","A major advance

Vaginal ring, drug cut rates of HIV in Africa

A flexible and inexpensive ring that is inserted into the vagina, where it slowly releases an antiviral drug, helped protect African women against contracting HIV from their sexual partners, researchers said Monday in reports on two major studies that included more than 4,500 women.

The protection was not complete: Overall infection rates were reduced by only 27 percent and 31 percent, though women who were over 21 fared better. But researchers said that the device was still a major advance and that the results were the most promising to date in HIV prevention for African women. They said they would press ahead to get the ring approved and widely distributed as quickly as possible.

""The hope was to find something that could be usable enough by women that it would provide HIV protection, and that's what we got,"" said Dr. Jared Baeten, from the University of Washington, who led one of the studies, called Aspire. ""It gives me tremendous optimism.""

Globally, about 37 million people are infected with HIV, more than half of them women. The majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Tampa Bay Times,Dr. John Armstrong faces another close vote on confirmation,"Gov. Rick Scott’s surgeon general will again be on the hot seat Tuesday afternoon in what could be a close vote for Dr. John Armstrong to keep his job.

Armstrong, who is also secretary of the Department of Health, will have his second confirmation hearing in the Senate’s Ethics and Elections Committee.

For the past year, the surgeon general has been under fire for the removal of kids from the Children's Medical Services program, the repeal of standards for pediatric heart surgery, the slow rollout of medical marijuana and rising HIV infections amid cutbacks to county health departments, highlighted by Times/Herald reporting last month.

He cleared his first committee hearing — Health Policy — last week on a 5-4 vote, with Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, and the committee’s four Democrats voting against him. Sens. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, and Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, had voiced concerns but ultimately decided in favor of Armstrong.

In Ethics and Elections, he’ll need the support of six senators. The 10-member committee includes six Republicans and four Democrats.

It’s likely Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, will vote against Armstrong Tuesday as he did in Health Policy. What’s not clear is how many other Democrats will vote alongside him.

Flores last week said that she ""didn’t quite get the answers I needed"" to vote for Armstrong. If she sticks to her ""no"" vote and all four Democrats join her, Armstrong’s confirmation would be virtually dead, meaning would likely lose his $141,000-a-year job.

Technically, Senate rules do not require committee approval of the governor’s appointees. The chamber’s leadership could schedule a final vote on Armstrong by the full Senate without the Ethics and Elections Committee’s support.

Not only would that be unusual, but President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said he doesn't support doing that for any of Scott's appointees.

Tampa Bay Times,California safety board says no to mandatory condoms in porn,"LOS ANGELES — California officials in charge of workplace safety voted down a proposal Thursday that would have put condoms on porn actors, heeding the call of scores of industry officials who said doing so would force them to make films nobody would watch.

The state Division of Occupational Safety and Health's Standards Board voted the measure down when only three members supported it, Cal/Osha spokeswoman Julia Bernstein said. Four yes votes from the seven-member board were required for passage. The vote was 3-2 in favor, with one member absent and one board position currently open.

The board will now begin considering a new worker-safety measure for the porn industry, Bernstein said.

Board members appeared influenced by the dozens of porn industry representatives who filed to the dais during a public hearing in Oakland, Calif., to argue forcefully but politely that adopting the condom measure would either destroy their multibillion-industry or force it underground. Doing the latter, they said, could make it more dangerous to performers by eliminating safeguards such as the industry's requirement that actors be tested every 14 days for sexually transmitted diseases.

""I know you guys work really hard and have our best interests at stake, but we need you to work with us to find a solution,"" said porn actress SiouxsieQ, who also reports on the industry for various publications. ""When you criminalize sex work in any way, you make it more dangerous.""

Mike Stabile, a spokesman for the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, said after the vote that pornographers hope they can work closely in the future in crafting safety requirements that the industry can accept. He didn't say what those might be.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation has lobbied Cal/OSHA for years to adopt workplace safety standards specifically for the porn industry that are similar to what it has for other businesses.

Although disappointed by Thursday's vote, foundation spokesman Ged Kenslea said his organization was impressed that porn representatives said they recognize a need for some sort of regulation. He added his group would be interested in working with them to achieve that goal.

Under the 21-page proposal Cal/OSHA rejected, so-called engineering controls ""such as condoms"" must be used by actors engaging in sex to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV and other diseases. Movie producers would also be required to pay for medical visits, treatments and other health-care costs for their performers.

The problem, several speakers said, is that a large segment of their audience loses interest in a film when they see actors with condoms.

Others said that if the rules were put into effect, Cal/OSHA inspectors could also eventually begin ordering actors to use safety goggles and dental dams, adding no one would want to see a film with that equipment.

Although the new provisions rejected made no mention of goggles or dental dams, they would have required sex workers, like those in the medical industry, ensure that their eyes are protected from being infected by blood-borne pathogens.

Industry officials worried that without goggles that could have meant the end to any explicit oral sex scenes.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation has argued for years that the condom requirement was long overdue and that while it might not prevent transmission of all sexually transmitted diseases it would be far more effective than the industry's 14-day STD testing requirement.

One of those in favor of it, former actor Derrick Burts, has said he became infected with HIV while making porn films despite the testing protocol.

Condoms are already required for films made in Los Angeles County, thanks to an AIDS Healthcare Foundation-sponsored ordinance that voters adopted in 2012.

Meantime, the group has placed a similar measure on the statewide ballot for November.

""This will only energize us in preparing for that November ballot,"" Kenslea said of Thursday's outcome.",19/02/2016

For the past year, he has been under fire for the removal of kids from the Children's Medical Services program, the repeal of standards for pediatric heart surgery, the slow rollout of medical marijuana and rising HIV infections amid cutbacks to county health departments, highlighted by Times/Herald reporting last month.

Lawmakers brought up all of those issues in Tuesday's hearing.

For his part, Armstrong defended his record, saying that the department has changed its focus in recent years, moving away from direct care to patients and toward preventing infectious disease outbreaks such as the Zika virus and energizing communities to fight local health problems.

Some senators weren't convinced, including Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, who said he hasn't seen the Health Department do much to fight the ""epidemic"" of HIV. Florida leads the country for new HIV infections, and no area in the United States has a higher infection rate per 100,000 residents than South Florida.

""He still falls short on that,"" Braynon said.

Armstrong needed support from five of the health panel's nine members. Five Republicans — including Sens. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, and Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, who have been critical of Armstrong — voted in favor of the surgeon general's confirmation.

One Republican, Sen. Anitere Flores of Miami, joined with the panel's three Democrats to oppose Armstrong.

""I didn't quite get the answers I needed today to vote in favor,"" Flores said.

She has asked to see data showing that patients who had access to primary care in the county health departments are now being served by other charitable clinics in local communities, which Armstrong said has been part of a change in the department's goals.

Part of that change has been a decrease in the number of positions authorized by the Legislature in the department's budget. The 67 county health departments have declined to 10,519 positions, compared with 12,759 in 2011. In defending those cutbacks — amounting to 17.5 percent — officials in Department of Health and the governor's office often point to them being vacant positions.

This year, the governor is asking for more than 700 additional cuts across the department, many of them in county health departments.

But Armstrong said Tuesday that he anticipates the widespread cuts will not prevent some county health departments from filling vacant positions.

In addition, Flores said she has questions about ""what role Dr. Armstrong might play in advising and advocating"" for Gov. Scott's veto of $9.5 million for free clinics in last year's budget.

Armstrong said he and Scott did not discuss those vetoes.

Still, Braynon said it's the Senate's job to hold high-level gubernatorial appointees accountable.

""Unfortunately, if you're the person telling the governor what he should do in health care … and that's what the governor decides to do, I kind of hold you responsible for it,"" Braynon said.

Not every senator has been critical, however.

Sen. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring, said Armstrong has done a ""good job."" So did Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, who chairs the Ethics and Elections Committee, which is Armstrong's next hurdle.

""I don't have any concerns,"" he said.

Richter said he plans to give Armstrong a hearing. But it could be tough for him to secure support from six of the ethics committee's 10 members.

Four of the senators on the panel are Democrats, and Flores sits on the committee as well. Those five votes against Armstrong could handicap his confirmation.

Flores said she isn't yet ready to support Armstrong, but she might come around.

""It's not an easy or fun decision to be voting for or against someone's livelihood,"" she said. ""I guess that I'm not there yet. Let's see what kind of information I get in the next week.""

Tampa Bay Times,Surgeon General Armstrong narrowly clears first confirmation hearing,"Dr. John Armstrong faced tough questions and ultimately cleared his first confirmation hurdle on a 5-4 vote in the Senate Health Policy Committee this afternoon.

Armstrong, first appointed by Gov. Rick Scott in 2012 to run the Department of Health, has been under fire for the removal of kids from the Children’s Medical Services program, rising HIV infections particularly in South Florida, the repeal of standards for pediatric heart surgery and cutbacks to county health departments.

""I think that he has a lot to answer for,"" said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, before the Health Policy Committee meeting. ""I think everybody has questions, and it’s not just the Democrats. There’s a lot being heard from the Dade County people.""

Tampa Bay Times,Florida House and Senate approve budgets at odds with each other and Gov. Rick Scott,"TALLAHASSEE — The Senate and House on Thursday passed differing versions of a state budget but with the common theme of opposition to Gov. Rick Scott's biggest priorities.

The Senate declared Scott's goal of $1 billion in tax cuts dead on arrival and ""fiscally irresponsible"" in the words of its top budget writer, Sen. Tom Lee, R-Brandon. Across the hall in the Capitol, the House showed no interest in Scott's other priority of a three-year, $250 million incentive fund to close deals with businesses that want to move to Florida.

""We don't have additional funding for new incentives in this budget,"" said Rep. Clay Ingram, R-Pensacola.

Both chambers adopted budgets that reflect Republican goals of more money for schools, a smaller state workforce, and no new taxes or tuition increases.

Democrats said the spending plans fail to improve chronic problems such as underpaid state workers, staff shortages in prisons and long waiting lists for state services for the sick and elderly.

""Any life that we lose is one too many,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Arthenia Joyner of Tampa, citing a report by Politico Florida that 6,538 people died while on waiting lists for services in programs to keep the elderly in community or home care and out of nursing homes.

The report was based on state data from the 2014-2015 fiscal year.

House Democrats criticized Republicans for including a ban on future funding for Planned Parenthood. ""A slur,"" said Rep. Dwight Dudley, D-St. Petersburg, of a ban that's not in the Senate budget and likely won't be.

Rep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, faulted Republicans for ignoring the need for more people to get health insurance coverage. She criticized the elimination of hundreds of vacant positions in the Department of Health when South Florida leads the nation in new HIV infections, as the Times/Herald has reported.

""It shouldn't be a surprise that Florida is surging to the top of preventable diseases,'' Cruz said.

The House passed its budget on a vote of 85-29, and the Senate vote was 40-0.

Despite their policy differences, lawmakers who must face voters this fall are mindful of the need to behave and reach agreement faster and more amicably than last year, when bitter infighting led to an abrupt walkout by the House and forced a three-week special session on the budget.

Tax cuts, business incentives and dozens of other budget issues will be used as bargaining chips in the weeks ahead.

""That's the art of a compromise, to find out where we can match up,"" said House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island.

But with four weeks to go in the current nine-week session, the legislative resistance to tax cuts and incentive money will nudge Scott to engage more directly with his fellow Republicans, who make the key budget decisions.

Scott said legislators should pass his priorities because he has already supported theirs.

""The speaker had his priority, the water bill. It passed and I signed it,"" Scott told reporters in Tampa this week. ""The Senate president's priority was the (Andy) Gardiner scholarships for individuals with unique abilities. They passed it and I signed it. I'm very comfortable that they know my priorities.""

But another budget problem for Scott became glaringly obvious Thursday in an emerging battle with the Senate over how to pay for a big increase in per-pupil spending in public schools.

Scott and legislators agree on increasing K-12 spending, especially with a projected increase of more than 35,000 students next fall.

But the Senate is pushing a plan to reduce Scott's reliance on higher property tax payments for homeowners and businesses by replacing it with an infusion of $326 million in state tax revenue, which is $183 million more in state taxes than the proposed Senate budget.

Doing that, however, would leave even less money available for tax cuts. The House and Scott oppose the idea, with Scott's office calling senators ""flat wrong"" to describe as a tax increase higher property tax bills tied to rising property values.

Scott's demand for $1 billion in tax cuts is more than a political goal. It's an unfulfilled promise from his 2014 re-election campaign, when he pledged $1 billion in tax cuts over two years.

Crisafulli said the House and Senate must agree on a specific amount of tax cuts that are permanent or recurring.

The House has embraced most of Scott's tax cut ideas, except for the elimination of the corporate income tax on retailers and manufacturers, and has added many ideas of its own in a wide-ranging package that affects renewable energy, hunters and fishermen, college students and cider made from pears.

The House's biggest single tax cut is reducing by two percentage points over two years the 6 percent sales tax on commercial rents.

That tax cut would take $410 million out of the state treasury in the first year, with most of that a permanent cut. Lee, the Senate's budget chief, said such recurring tax cuts are ""not sustainable"" because they will create budget gaps in future years that will bind future Legislatures.

The Senate has not yet crafted a tax cut package.

""Who's the more responsible individual?"" Lee asked senators. ""Is it the person who cuts the most taxes? Or is it the person who lives within their means?""

Tampa Bay Times,Gay groups seek to buy NYC church known for hateful messages,"NEW YORK — The end may be nigh for a Harlem church known for hateful public messages condemning gays and President Barack Obama to eternal damnation, and two groups that serve gay New Yorkers are hoping to get an ironic last word on the matter.

They want to buy the Atlah World Missionary Church at a foreclosure auction. One wants to turn it into housing for gay homeless youth.

The congregation's pastor has vowed not to let that happen.

""We're not going to be pushed like this,"" said Dr. James David Manning, who literally thumped a leather-bound Bible during an interview at his church this week. ""I'm tired of people ramming their ideas down one's throat.""

A fixture in Harlem for more than 30 years, the Atlah World Missionary Church has never been shy about expressing its own blunt ideas.

The large red billboard in front of the church is emblazoned with rotating messages like one that said to gays ""cursed be thou with cancer, HIV, syphilis, stroke, madness, the itch, then Hell."" Others have gone after Obama, calling him ""a Taliban Muslim illegally elected president.""

Manning, who is black, also rails against ""sodomites"" on the Manning Report, his three-hour daily radio broadcast, and in YouTube videos laced with gay slurs.

So, when the news broke that the church owed $1 million to creditors and was facing a foreclosure auction Feb. 24, some quarters received it with glee.

One nonprofit group, the Ali Forney Center, has raised $175,000 on its website as part of an effort to buy the church and convert the building into transitional housing for homeless gay youths — the very population, its leaders say, that is most harmed by the Atlah church's message.

""We ask our kids why they weren't safe in their homes. … The No. 1 reason is because of the hostile religious beliefs of their parents,"" said the center's executive director, Carl Siciliano.

He added that the church location, just a few blocks from the Ali Forney Center's Harlem drop-in center, would be ideal ""even if it didn't have the Rev. Manning angle to it.""

A second effort to buy the four-story brick and terra cotta church building has been organized by the Rivers of Living Water Ministries, which serves mainly African-American LGBT worshipers. The church's GoFundMe drive had raised more than $23,000 as of Friday morning.

Rivers of Living Water shares space with other congregations in an Upper West Side church and needs its own home, said pastor Vanessa Brown, adding that Manning's anti-gay message ""causes trauma.""

""It's a trigger for people that have been thrown out by churches because of their sexuality and their gender identity,"" she said.

Manning is vowing to fight what he sees as a politically motivated effort to oust him from the neighborhood he has served for more than 30 years.

In an interview, he said the $1 million he has been told the church owes is nothing but a water bill. ""A million-dollar water bill? Imagine that!"" he said.

Court documents also show federal tax liens totaling more than $355,000 and other debts. The church had until April 2015 to pay back $1.02 million to creditors, according to court documents.

Manning insisted that the sale will not go forward.

""I don't plan to pay up, but if I had to, I could,"" he said. ""I wouldn't give this building up.""

An attorney representing the church, Daniel S. LoPresti of the firm Shaw & Binder, said the firm is taking ""all necessary legal steps to protect the church from the foreclosure sale of its property.""

If the sale does take place as scheduled, there's far from any guarantee that either the Ali Forney Center or the Rivers of Living Water Ministries would have enough for a winning bid. Harlem real estate, like the rest of New York, has been hot in recent years.

The property could be snapped up by a developer, which might also be seen as an ironic end. Much of Manning's rhetoric is aimed at white gentrification of historically black Harlem.

At least one Harlem neighbor said she'd love to see the church go.

""We'd like this corner to be no longer a corner of hatred, but a corner of compassion,"" said Stacy Parker Le Melle, who lives across the street and is helping to raise funds for the Ali Forney Center's bid.

Le Melle said the church's signs are hurtful to the community, especially the ones that advocate violence.

""It's not just words,"" she said. ""There are people who are affected by this language. The hate speech creates a climate of terrible possibility.""",06/02/2016
Tampa Bay Times,"Pharma CEO Martin Shkreli takes 5th amendment, still infuriates lawmakers (w/video)","WASHINGTON — Infuriating members of Congress, a smirking Martin Shkreli took the Fifth at a Capitol Hill hearing Thursday when asked about his jacking up of drug prices, then promptly went on Twitter and insulted his questioners as ""imbeciles.""

The brash, 32-year-old entrepreneur who has been vilified as the new face of pharmaceutical-industry greed was summoned by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is investigating soaring prices for critical medicines.

Four times, he intoned: ""On the advice of counsel, I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and respectfully decline to answer your question.""

Lawmakers erupted. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, told Shkreli to wipe the smirk off his face.

""I call this money blood money ... coming out of the pockets of hardworking Americans,"" he said, as Shkreli sat through the lecture.

""I know you are smiling, but I am very serious, sir,"" Cummings said. ""I truly believe you can become a force of tremendous good. All I ask is that you reflect on it. No, I don't ask, I beg that you reflect on it. ""

The former hedge fund manager with a frat-boy swagger has been reviled in recent months for buying Daraprim, the only approved drug for a rare and sometimes deadly parasitic infection, and unapologetically raising its price more than fiftyfold.

Shkreli is out on $5 million bail after being arrested in New York in December on securities-fraud charges unrelated to the price increase.

Shkreli, wearing a sport jacket and open-collar shirt, was dismissed less than an hour into the hearing, but not before Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, shouted down a request by Shkreli's attorney to speak. Lawmakers instead took turns denouncing his conduct and attitude.

Minutes after he left — and even before the hearing had ended — Shkreli thumbed his nose at the committee.

""Hard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government,"" the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals tweeted.

Shkreli's attorney Benjamin Brafman later said in his defense: ""He meant no disrespect, but in truth, statements made by some of the members of the committee were wrong, unfair and difficult to listen to without responding.""

Shkreli calls himself ""the world's most eligible bachelor"" and ""the most successful Albanian to ever walk the face of this Earth."" He strums his guitar on YouTube and paid a reported $2 million for the only known copy of an album by the Wu-Tang Clan.

After Shkreli's departure, Turing's chief commercial officer and the interim CEO of Canada's largest drugmaker, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, received a bipartisan lashing from the lawmakers.

Chaffetz, an admitted ""conservative guy"" who accepts that companies need to make profits, said he was disgusted. And Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., told them: ""This is a scandal, an absolute abuse of power, an abuse of the pharmaceutical industry.""

Internal documents released by the committee show that Valeant and Turing have made a practice of buying and then dramatically raising prices for low-cost drugs given to patients with life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, AIDS and cancer.

The two companies' executives insisted they are committed to ensuring that cost isn't a deterrent for patients who need the drugs.

With Shkreli mum, it was up to Turing's Nancy Retzlaff to defend the Daraprim price rise. She said about 3,000 people are treated with Daraprim, and only 25 percent are covered by commercial insurance. She added that the overall impact of the drug on the budget of commercial health plans ""is very, very small.""

The documents show how executives at both companies planned to maximize profits while fending off negative publicity.

As early as last May, Turing planned to turn Daraprim into a $200-million-a-year drug by dramatically increasing its price, according to documents obtained by the committee. Turing bought the 60-year-old drug in August for $55 million.

Shkreli said in an email to one contact: ""We raised the price from $1,700 per bottle to $75,000. Should be a very handsome investment for all of us.""

But the company also warned in an internal memo of a possible backlash from advocates for HIV patients.

As for Valeant, documents indicate the company believed it could repeatedly raise the prices of Nitropress and Isuprel without repercussions because the drugs are administered by hospitals, which are less price-sensitive than consumers.",04/02/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Britain approves gene-editing experiments for human embryos,"In a landmark decision that some ethicists warned is a step down the path toward ""designer babies,"" Britain gave scientists approval Monday to conduct gene-editing experiments on human embryos.

The researchers won't be creating babies — the modified embryos will be destroyed after seven days. Instead, they said, the goal is to better understand human development so as to improve fertility treatments and prevent miscarriages.

The decision by Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority marks the first time a country's national regulator has approved the technique. Permission isn't explicitly required in many other countries, including the United States and China. The United States does not allow the use of federal funds for embryo modification, but there is no outright ban on gene editing.

Gene editing involves deleting, repairing or replacing bits of DNA inside living cells in a biological cut-and-paste technique that scientists say could one day lead to treatments for HIV or inherited disorders such as muscular dystrophy and sickle cell disease.

A team led by Kathy Niakan, an embryo and stem cell specialist at London's new Francis Crick Institute, received the okay to use gene editing to analyze the first week of an embryo's growth.

The research will ""enhance our understanding of IVF (in vitro fertilization) success rates by looking at the very earliest stage of human development,"" said Paul Nurse, director of the institute.

None of the embryos will be transferred into women. They will be allowed to develop from a single cell to around 250 cells, after which they will be destroyed.

Some critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could be a slippery slope that eventually leads to so-called designer babies, where parents not only aim to avoid inherited diseases but also seek taller, stronger, smarter or better-looking children.

At an international meeting in Washington last year, scientists agreed that attempts to alter early embryos as part of laboratory research should be allowed but that the technique was nowhere near ready for use in pregnant women.",02/02/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Sunday's letters: Don't reward border crashers,"Immigration discretion | Jan. 21, New York Times editorial

Don't reward the border crashers

This editorial states that the clearest solution to the 11 million-plus illegal aliens living in the United States is to ""focus on removing those who pose an actual threat to public safety while deferring action on most of the rest."" The problem is in trying to identify those who pose a public safety threat in this age of international terrorists plotting to kill Americans inside and outside the country.

While the United States has always been a beacon and haven for those seeking economic betterment, the best way for those people to enter the country is to apply for work visas and, after due time for U.S. screening, apply for American citizenship. Crashing the borders and later being rewarded with citizenship appears to be tolerated in no other country except the United States.

To reward the crashers with citizenship makes a mockery of our system of laws and fairness to natural-born American citizens. How would Americans seeking to illegally live in Mexico, Central America or the Middle East be treated? I support legal and productive, taxpaying immigration to strengthen and diversify the nation. However, providing citizenship and its benefits to those who ignore our laws has risks.

It's better to reform the immigration laws while prosecuting and deporting those who break the law by crashing the borders. This reform should be through congressional action in accordance with the Constitution, and not through presumptive executive and court actions.

High cost of health cuts | Jan. 26, editorial

Keeping up fight on AIDS

When I was training as a surgeon, HIV and AIDS had just come on the scene, and I remember the fear — not only in the public, but throughout the medical and particularly the surgical community. Fear replaced reason and was a barrier to care for patients with HIV/AIDS. It was important to me to understand HIV/AIDS so that I could provide safe surgical care, and when a patient with HIV/AIDS needed an operation I went to the operating room. I've seen HIV/AIDS at its worst, and we've come a long way. Still, there is more work to be done.

We have turned a corner over the last 20 years, but with progress can come complacency. Some have forgotten how HIV/AIDS ravaged at-risk populations in the '80s and '90s — but I have not. As Florida's surgeon general and secretary of the Department of Health, I assure you we are committed to eliminating HIV/AIDS.

Through targeted outreach, the department brings together community partners to reach high-risk populations for education and testing. Our mobile health units go into neighborhoods to talk about prevention and provide testing and counseling. We also sponsored the ""Faces of HIV"" traveling art exhibit that has brought this issue to life. We can help educate a new generation about HIV/AIDS.

When we began our celebration of 125 Years of Florida Public Health, I started by visiting the AIDS Memorial in Key West. This was an important place to start a year of reflection on how far we've come with public health, but it also was a time to renew our commitment to move forward, not back.

Public health is local. No two communities are exactly alike, which is why we do not focus on ""one-size-fits-all"" solutions but rather ones centered on communities. Working together, we can fight this horrible disease.

State not sold on Sanders | Jan. 27

The appeal of Sanders

For months the Times has done an excellent job convincing us of two things: The Iowa and New Hampshire primaries are critical, and Hillary Clinton is the front-runner.

Now, just when it seems that Clinton might lose both contests, the Times offers a new viewpoint in this article. It points out that even if Sen. Bernie Sanders wins Iowa and New Hampshire, he just might lose contests such as the South Carolina primary.

The article then lists some respected Florida Democrats who seem afraid that Sanders might not make a strong candidate. Against Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz? Please.

With all due respect, they may not know Sanders very well, and I wonder just how many primaries he would need to win before the establishment realizes he knows how to win votes. Sanders has been underestimated throughout his political career in rural, agricultural Vermont, a state that in many ways is a lot more conservative than outsiders realize.

I was a voter in Vermont for almost 30 years and watched as many Republicans openly criticized Sanders and then quietly voted for him. Why? Because he is a hardworking pragmatist and, labels aside, much of what he advocates is middle-of-the-road common sense.

If Sanders wins the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, I hope the Times will not feel it necessary to tell us that these wins are unimportant.

Tampa Bay Times,Member of prominent McMullen family joins Largo City Commission race,"LARGO — The City Commission race this week lost one candidate and is gaining another, adding to a battle for Seat 3 that has already included a felony extortion arrest.

Neil McMullen, a descendant of one of the county's founding families, said this week that he plans to run with a platform that focuses on community redevelopment that not only creates a thriving economy for Largo but also promotes the general welfare of the public.

""Redevelopment is not just an economic term,"" McMullen, 65, said. ""It's asking, 'What do bricks and mortar and new businesses really mean and really bring to the community?'""

Aaron Darr, known for his advocacy work with Florida's HIV and AIDS groups, decided to withdraw from the race and throw his support behind McMullen in order to avoid a split vote between what he feels are two progressive candidates with similar ideas for the city, he said.

""My intention of doing this is really for unity to make sure a progressive wins this race and make sure that Curtis Holmes does not get re-elected,"" said Darr, 24, adding that he believes the incumbent is an obstructionist who has only his personal interests in mind.

Holmes, 66, said Tuesday that he intends to run for re-election, although he hasn't filed yet. He called Darr's comments rhetoric, saying the former candidate has no evidence to back up his claims.

""I think I have been one of the most effective commissioners the city's had in a long time,"" he said.

Darr, who was diagnosed with HIV at 17, said his decision was not influenced by an extortion incident in which police say an anonymous email claiming to have damaging information about Darr was traced back to the computer of another candidate, 31-year-old Robert Avery.

McMullen, a resident of Largo for about three years and of North Pinellas for three decades before that, said he wants to give back to the city that has been home to his family for generations.

""It just felt like the right time to have McMullen associated with Largo again,"" he said.

The family's roots in the area date to 1841 when the family of seven brothers came from South Georgia, he said. His grandfather, Donald C. McMullen, was a state senator who drafted the legislation to create Pinellas County. Another relative, Joel McMullen, was the first mayor of Largo in 1905.

Neil McMullen grew up in Tampa and graduated from Florida State University with a degree in sociology and a minor in communications, then Emory University for his master of divinity.

He worked for 26 years as a United Methodist minister for several local congregations and held leadership positions in the Florida Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. He earned his master of business administration from the University of South Florida during that time.

Following his clergy career, McMullen handled fundraising for the Suncoast Alzheimer's & Gerontology Center at USF, now part of the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer's Institute. He currently runs a consulting business serving nonprofit and faith-based organizations.

McMullen said if elected, he would use his professional experience and involvement in the city's development and redevelopment advisory boards to bolster the economy and the standard of living for Largo residents.

He pointed to the city's Medical Arts District off West Bay Drive as a prime opportunity to carry out that vision by adding destinations for cancer research and clinical trials to the area. It would put Largo on the map as a research center, which could lead to federal dollars, he said, and bring more well-educated people to settle in the city.

""I'm looking for ways to dovetail bits and pieces to make what's already happening a little bit better,"" he said, adding that he also wants to prioritize developing the city's east side and creating a welcoming environment for artists.

Tampa Bay Times,"With HIV cases climbing, Florida Democrats push for responsible sex education in public schools","With Florida leading the nation in new HIV infections, Democratic lawmakers say now more than ever the Legislature should do away with what's commonly referred to as ""abstinence-only"" sex education in the state's 4,300 public schools.

Sen. Dwight Bullard, D-Cutler Bay, and Rep. Reggie Fullwood, D-Jacksonville, are the leading sponsors of what they've dubbed the ""Florida Healthy Adolescence Act"" (SB 1056/HB 859).

The bill makes comprehensive sex education an option for districts -- which ""doesn't force anything on school districts, on schools, on parents,"" Fullwood said. Those districts that do choose to offer it would have to provide medically accurate, factual and age-appropriate information to students.

Information covered by the umbrella of ""human sexuality"" education would include: family planning, pregnancy and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV and AIDS.

Bullard, a teacher for the past 16 years, said ""students are going to do what students do,"" and adults need to give them the tools to make smart decisions, rather than promoting what he described as an outdated and naive policy.

""Let's just be honest with ourselves,"" he said. ""We can no longer assume by saying the word 'abstinence' that people will automatically abstain. It doesn't happen in real life; it doesn't happen with adults. Why would we even assume it happens with teenagers?""

""A teen that understands the ramifications and the totality of what they're doing is going to be a better prepared adult,"" he said.

Both Bullard's and Fullwood's bills have been referred to the Senate and House education policy committees. But neither are expected to get a hearing in the Republican-led Legislature this session.

During their press conference Wednesday at the Capitol, Bullard and Fullwood referenced increasing HIV cases in Florida -- data which was detailed in a Herald/Times analysis this week.

HIV infections have risen each year since 2012 as they've declined across the country. Miami-Dade and Broward counties were Nos. 1 and 2 in the United States in new HIV infections in 2014 per 100,000 residents, according to state and federal data. The increase in cases came while Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Dr. John Armstrong, the state's top health officer, have imposed four years of personnel cuts in the Department of Health that have shrunk the size of county health departments.

""We can no longer afford, as a state, to stand behind and wait, hoping aspirationally that things are going to change by simply using outdated methods of educating our teens about their sexual behavior,"" Bullard said.

Fullwood said the legislation could also be called the ""Reality Check Act.""

""We're living in a world that doesn't exist as far as sex ed in our schools,"" he said. ""Ideally, abstinence is the best policy, but it's not real. ... We have a population of kids who are practicing sex and we're just not being realistic enough to educate them.""

Florida law requires public schools to ""teach abstinence from sexual activity outside of marriage as the expected standard for all school-age students while teaching the benefits of monogamous heterosexual marriage.""

Bullard and Fullwood's legislation would repeal that, allowing schools the freedom to teach comprehensive sex education. Under the bills, parents could review a school's curriculum upon request and a student could be excused from a human sexuality lesson with a parent's written permission.

The legislation includes an anti-bullying provision, by requiring information that ""encourages young people to practice healthy life skills,"" such as overcoming peer pressure and making good decisions ""to avoid high-risk activities.""

Cliff Myrtil, a Boynton Beach Community High School senior in Palm Beach County, said students ""have the right to accurate information,"" so they can make good decisions.

""Florida just can't afford not to educate our young people about how to protect their health,"" he said.",28/01/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Should Florida revisit sex education in public schools? Dems say it's time,"With Florida leading the nation in new HIV infections, Democratic lawmakers say now more than ever the Legislature should do away with what's commonly referred to as ""abstinence-only"" sex education in the state's 4,300 public schools.

Sen. Dwight Bullard, D-Cutler Bay, and Rep. Reggie Fullwood, D-Jacksonville, are the leading sponsors of what they've dubbed the ""Florida Healthy Adolescence Act"" (SB 1056/HB 859).

The bill makes comprehensive sex education an option for districts -- which ""doesn't force anything on school districts, on schools, on parents,"" Fullwood said. Those districts that do choose to offer it would have to provide medically accurate, factual and age-appropriate information to students.

Information covered by the umbrella of ""human sexuality"" education would include: family planning, pregnancy and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV and AIDS.

Bullard, a teacher for the past 16 years, said ""students are going to do what students do,"" and adults need to give them the tools to make smart decisions, rather than promoting what he described as an outdated and naive policy.

""Let's just be honest with ourselves,"" he said during a press conference Wednesday at the Florida Capitol.

Tampa Bay Times,Medical marijuana initiative will appear on ballot this November,"Floridians will decide this November whether to allow medical marijuana in the state.

On Wednesday, a constitutional amendment to legalize the drug gained enough signed petitions to qualify for the ballot next November. If passed, the amendment would allow doctors to describe marijuana for people with ""debilitating conditions"" such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.

""This November, Florida will pass this law and hundreds of thousands of sick and suffering people will see relief,"" Orlando lawyer John Morgan said in a written statement. ""What Tallahassee politicians refused to do, the people will do together in this election.""

Morgan is the chairman of United for Care, the group behind the amendment and has bankrolled it to this point, contributing nearly all of its $3.3 million in donations.

Legalizing medical marijuana has been a contentious issue for years in Florida politics as 23 states and Washington, D.C. have approved the drug for medical use and voters in four have legalized it for recreation.

A similar amendment gained the support of 58 percent of voters in 2014, falling just shy of the required 60-percent threshold to amend the state constitution.

But Morgan said he’s convinced this year will be different.

""Our language is stronger than in 2014 and it shows,"" he said. ""The people of Florida are compassionate. We will win this election for the really sick people in our state.""

As of Wednesday night, county supervisors of elections had submitted 692,981 signed petitions on behalf of the medical marijuana initiative, more than enough to qualify for the ballot. The Florida Supreme Court approved the proposed language for the amendment last year without any opposition from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who tried to stop the 2014 attempt.

In Tallahassee, state lawmakers are considering legislation that would expand existing, limited medical cannabis laws. A 2014 law allows certain patients to use strains of cannabis low in the euphoric chemical THC. Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, want that expanded to allow people with terminal illnesses to use full-fledged medical marijuana.

Only one other constitutional amendment has gotten enough petition support: an initiative backed by utility companies that reiterates existing state regulations. That ballot question has not yet been cleared by the Supreme Court.

Tampa Bay Times,"Largo Commission race loses one candidate, gains another","An already eventful City Commission race got a new twist Tuesday when Aaron Darr, a prominent advocate for Florida's HIV and AIDS community, withdrew his candidacy to throw his support behind Neil McMullen, a descendant of one of the city's oldest families.

Darr, 24, said he made his decision to avoid a split vote between what he feels are two progressive candidates with similar ideas for the city, including creation of programs that focus on early childhood education, development of a more prominent downtown, and an emphasis on arts and culture in the community.

""My intention of doing this is really for unity to make sure a progressive wins this race and make sure that Curtis Holmes does not get re-elected,"" he said, adding that he believes the incumbent is an obstructionist who has only his personal interests in mind.

McMullen has not yet filed with the city to run, said City Clerk Diane Bruner, but when reached by phone Tuesday morning, he confirmed he plans to enter the race.

Holmes also hasn't filed to run but said in December he intends to pursue re-election.

Darr, who was diagnosed with HIV at 17, said his decision to withdraw was not influenced by an extortion scandal between him and another candidate.

According to police, Robert Avery sent an anonymous email to Darr in August via his campaign website saying that he had ""nice things the city of Largo will be seeing soon"" and for Darr to remember to ""never post anything digitally you wouldn't want your mom or partner to see.""

Avery, 31, was arrested in late November on felony extortion charges and told a reporter at the time that his computer was hacked.

Darr said he plans to shift his focus to helping McMullen get elected in the Nov. 8 election and continuing to raise awareness for issues facing those in the HIV and AIDS community, especially in light of a recent Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau story that Florida leads the nation in new HIV infections.

As far as his political career goes, Darr said he may explore other opportunities down the line.

Tampa Bay Times,"Sen. Gaetz plans to ask surgeon general about job cuts, rising HIV infections","Surgeon General John Armstrong this week faces his first Senate confirmation vote, and Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, is preparing to ask some tough questions.

Gaetz gave Gov. Rick Scott’s top health official a heads-up in a letter sent Friday on seven questions that could come up Tuesday morning when the Health Policy committee decides if Armstrong should keep his $141,000-a-year job. At the heart of them are position cuts in the Department of Health and in county health departments, which Armstrong oversees, even as diseases like HIV grow in Florida.

Since 2012, when Armstrong was appointed, the number of positions in DOH has decreased from 17,107 to 14,358. Scott is asking for an additional 718 cuts next year.

Over that same period of time, HIV infections have risen dramatically in Florida, even as they fell nationwide. Miami-Dade and Broward counties now lead the nation in new HIV cases per 100,000 residents. In the letter, Gaetz asks Armstrong to clarify that data, as well.

And he wants more information about the subject Armstrong most often talks about: obesity, which some advocates say he has focused on to the detriment of disease prevention.

""You have clearly and persuasively articulated your goal of reducing childhood and adult obesity … Is there data available that shows the positive impact of your efforts,"" Gaetz wrote.

Many of the jobs that could be cut are what Gaetz calls ""phantom positions,"" which means they’re jobs that aren’t currently filled but are left on the books in the state budget. And many of the cuts during Scott and Armstrong’s tenure have hit county health departments that serve poor communities and those without insurance.

""Even with the governor’s extraordinary success in promoting a million private sector jobs, there are still large numbers of persons looking for work or training for jobs and, at present, are without health coverage,"" Gaetz wrote. ""What is the appropriate source of primary care for these individuals who otherwise have to rely upon either the county health departments or free/charitable clinics?""

Gaetz is one of six Republicans and three Democrats on the Senate Health Policy committee, which failed to confirm Armstrong last year.

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: The high cost of cutting health budgets,"Running government on the cheap has a high price, and state lawmakers should finally start paying attention to the devastation it causes. Years of Florida budget cuts to essential government agencies, including the Departments of Health, Children and Families, and Corrections, have started to bear the bitter fruit of skyrocketing new HIV infections, a dysfunctional mental health system and violent, understaffed prisons and mental hospitals that have far too many unexplained patient and inmate deaths. Siphoning resources from government via haphazard tax cuts rips the social fabric of the state, which harms everyone. Because it is about people, the erosion of the social infrastructure is even more insidious than the potholed roads and crumbling bridges of the physical infrastructure. The Legislature should put a stop to it.

Florida's Surgeon General and Secretary of Health Dr. John Armstrong should face some tough questions from members of the Senate today during his confirmation hearing. While Armstrong has been the state's top medical officer, HIV rates have soared in Florida, reaching 6,240 new cases through November 2015, the highest number of new cases since 2002. At the same time that HIV infection rates are rising, state leaders have been steadily trimming the Department of Health's budget. Florida's 67 county health departments have lost 2,240 positions since Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, according to the Tampa Bay Times, which detailed the effect of runaway budget cuts on Monday. The Health Department has shed more than 3,000 jobs since 2011. And Scott isn't finished. His 2016-17 budget calls for cutting 718 Health Department jobs, including 507 in county health departments. The proposal is expected to save $13 million, a pittance when weighed against the value of human life.

AIDS has killed 39 million people worldwide and more than 650,000 in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, more than 1.2 million people are living with HIV. While infection rates around the country have been falling, Florida's rates continue to rise, contributing to the 50,000 new infections in the country each year. The Legislature has the power to help the state reverse course.

Public health experts are fighting to convince a new generation of youth — unfamiliar with the way AIDS ravaged the country in the 1980s and 1990s — that the disease is deadly and incurable. They also must reach an older generation who witnessed HIV diagnoses as a death sentence but now engage in risky behavior because they see the success of antiretroviral drugs and no longer fear the disease. Starving the government agencies that could combat ignorance exacerbates the problem.

State health officials should devote more resources to public education efforts to prevent new infections. Lawmakers should ignore the governor's request for $1 billion in budget cuts and fully fund the government, particularly the social services agencies that cater to the state's most vulnerable populations, including the sick, low-income and minorities. Helping them helps everyone. The lives of Floridans should count more than the interests of big businesses seeking a tax break.",25/01/2016
Tampa Bay Times,Florida leads U.S. in new HIV cases after years of cuts in public health,"TALLAHASSEE — Florida leads the nation in new HIV infections, but it's not being treated as a crisis by Gov. Rick Scott or the state's top health officer, Dr. John Armstrong.

As the virus has spread, Scott and Armstrong have imposed four years of personnel cuts in the Department of Health that have shrunk the size of county health departments.

State lawmakers are now asking whether the spending decisions have produced a sicker population in a state where HIV infections have risen each year since 2012 as they've declined across the country.

Miami-Dade and Broward counties were Nos. 1 and 2 in the United States in new HIV infections in 2014 per 100,000 residents, according to state and federal data.

Armstrong said Florida is spending a record $34 million on HIV and AIDS prevention this year, thanks to a federal grant. He did not dispute the rise in infections.

""Staff reductions did not impact the surveillance, education, prevention, counseling, testing, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS patients,"" he said in a statement.

But some advocates say Armstrong is part of the problem because he rarely talks about HIV or AIDS and instead places greater emphasis on fighting childhood obesity.

""Without leadership at the head of the agency speaking about this, it creates a hurdle,"" said David Poole, director of legislative affairs for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers treatment and prevention throughout Florida.

Poole worked in the Department of Health's HIV program for 12 years. He said staff reductions have hampered prevention, and that has led to a rise in cases.

""Silence equals death,"" said Ron Ford, 53, of Clearwater, a former HIV caseworker who has the virus. ""This does not have to happen. But people have to start talking about it for it not to happen.""

Armstrong is under new scrutiny about rising HIV rates and budget cuts as he faces a Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday in an effort to keep his job.

A former Army trauma surgeon, he was a top medical officer at the USF Health Center, earning $405,000 a year, when Scott appointed him surgeon general and health secretary in 2012.

In his first year, the state saw 4,512 new cases of HIV infections. The number has increased every year since then.

New cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. Miami-Dade and Broward together account for 38 percent of that total.

Although Florida is among the nation's fastest-growing states, Scott has pushed every year to trim the state workforce, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the Department of Health.

The 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions, compared with 12,759 when Scott took office in 2011.

""It's indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,"" said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens. ""We have a rise in AIDS, and we have a reduction in public health spending. We're now cutting just to be cutting.""

Braynon is a member of the Senate Health Policy Committee that will scrutinize Armstrong's record starting Tuesday.

The panel has six Republicans and three Democrats. All three Democrats have been critical of Armstrong, and one Republican is voicing doubts.

Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, is troubled that under Armstrong, the agency's mission has shifted away from direct patient care to messaging about health.

""We've seen a reduction in services provided by county health departments,"" Gaetz said. ""Health conditions exacerbate, and folks wind up in emergency rooms. That's a cycle that doesn't end well for patients or taxpayers.""

Gaetz said he respects Armstrong's work as a doctor and veteran but wants the agency's mission to return to treating more people at county clinics. He said he was undecided on whether to confirm Armstrong.

If Armstrong loses Gaetz's vote and can't win support from all five other Republicans on the panel, he'll be in jeopardy of losing his $141,000-a-year job.

Armstrong has clashed with senators twice in the past year. He dodged questions about whether the Senate's failed effort to expand Medicaid would have led to better health outcomes. His agency's changes to the Children's Medical Services program last year ended coverage for about 9,000 children.

Sen. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring, supports Armstrong but said past budget cuts may have cut too deeply.

""I'm not sure that we haven't over-reduced,"" she said. ""It's time for us to go back and look at the funding we give to them, especially in rural counties.""

Others say money is not the problem.

""We have found that Tallahassee is supportive and is doing whatever they can, within their ability, to address the uptick in HIV,"" said Priya Rajkumar, vice president of Metro Wellness and Community Centers in Tampa Bay.

Rajkumar said the state has launched programs to address HIV and AIDS in minority communities, including efforts to reach two separate high-risk groups: black women, and men who have sex with men.

Dr. Claude Dharamraj, retired director of the Pinellas County Health Department, said much of the state's money for HIV comes from the federal government.

Most is for people infected with the virus or those who have AIDS.

William Harper, executive director of the AIDS Service Association of Pinellas, said more state money would mean more education and prevention. He doubted budget cuts are tied to higher infection rates and suggested another possible reason.

""I think it's because there's more testing going on around the state,"" Harper said. ""We're finding people who have been HIV positive for a while and didn't know it.""

Armstrong declined requests to be interviewed.

The agency has a budget this year of $2.9 billion, mostly from fees and federal grants, with 14,358 budgeted positions, down from 17,367 five years ago.

Scott wants the Legislature to make more staff cuts next year. In his budget recommendations, Scott called for eliminating 718 more Department of Health jobs, of which 507 are in county health departments. Those cuts would save $13 million.

""Nearly two-thirds of the proposed staff reductions are vacant and therefore will not impact daily DOH operations or result in any interruption in services,"" Scott's office said.

State agencies often keep long-dormant ""phantom jobs"" on the books so that they can get credit from the Legislature when they eliminate those jobs to comply with demands to cut spending.

""Now that I see some of the consequences, I need to know what positions were cut that weren't phantom positions,"" Gaetz said.

Armstrong's own data shows that since fiscal year 2010, the year before Scott took office, the amount of state money spent on county health departments has fallen 26 percent, from $173 million that year to $128 million in the budget year that ended last June.

Miami-Dade lost a quarter of its county health revenue from the state during that period. Broward saw a reduction of 27 percent, Pinellas 27 percent and Hillsborough 31 percent. Hillsborough County health director Doug Holt did not respond to a request for comment.

During the same period, Scott also has vetoed millions of dollars for local health care programs.

When Scott signed the current budget last June, he vetoed $9.5 million for the Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, a network of 100 clinics that provide primary care to people lacking insurance.

Scott said liability laws blocked use of the money for salaries, and as a result, the program was ""not a statewide priority for improved cost, quality and access to health care.""

The clinics' director called Scott's statement misleading because the money could have been spent on equipment, support staff and medicines.

In the current budget, Scott also vetoed $3 million for residency slots for rural primary care doctors, $500,000 for local health centers in the Suncoast region north of Tampa Bay and $350,000 for an HIV/AIDS outpatient program at Broward's public hospitals.

Tampa Bay Times,Drug overdoses propel rise in mortality rates of whites in U.S.,"Drug overdoses are driving up the death rate of young, white adults in the United States to levels not seen since the end of the AIDS epidemic more than two decades ago — a turn of fortune that stands in sharp contrast to falling death rates for young blacks, a New York Times analysis of death certificates has found.

The rising death rates for those young white adults, ages 25 to 34, make them the first generation since the Vietnam War years of the mid 1960s to have higher death rates in early adulthood than the generation before it.

The New York Times analyzed nearly 60 million death certificates collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1990 to 2014. It found death rates for non-Hispanic whites either rising or flattening for all the adult age groups under 65 — a trend that was particularly pronounced in women — even as medical advances sharply reduce deaths from traditional killers like heart disease. Death rates for blacks and most Hispanic groups continued to fall.

The analysis shows that the rise in white mortality extends well beyond the 45- to 54-year-old age group documented by a pair of Princeton economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, in a research paper that startled policymakers and politicians two months ago.

While the death rate among young whites rose for every age group over the five years before 2014, it rose faster by any measure for the less educated, by 23 percent for those without a high school education, compared with only 4 percent for those with a college degree or more.

The drug overdose numbers were stark. In 2014, the overdose death rate for whites ages 25 to 34 was five times its level in 1999, and the rate for 35- to 44-year-old whites tripled during that period. The numbers cover both illegal and prescription drugs.

""That is startling,"" said Dr. Wilson Compton, the deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ""Those are tremendous increases.""

Rising rates of overdose deaths and suicide appeared to have erased the benefits from advances in medical treatment for most age groups of whites. Death rates for drug overdoses and suicides ""are running counter to those of chronic diseases,"" said Ian Rockett, an epidemiologist at West Virginia University.

In fact, graphs of the drug overdose deaths look like those of deaths from a new infectious disease, said Jonathan Skinner, a Dartmouth economist.

""It is like an infection model, diffusing out and catching more and more people,"" he said.

Yet overdose deaths for young adult blacks have edged up only slightly. Overall, the death rate for blacks has been steadily falling, largely driven by a decline in deaths from AIDS. The result is that a once yawning gap between death rates for blacks and whites has shrunk by two-thirds.

There is a reason that blacks appear to have been spared the worst of the narcotic epidemic, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a drug abuse expert. Studies have found that doctors are much more reluctant to prescribe painkillers to minority patients, worrying that they might sell them or become addicted.

""The answer is that racial stereotypes are protecting these patients from the addiction epidemic,"" said Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University and chief medical officer for Phoenix House Foundation, a national drug and alcohol treatment company.

Not many young people die of any cause. In 2014, there were about 29,000 deaths out of a population of about 25 million whites in the 25-to-34 age group. That number had steadily increased since 2004, rising by about 5,500 — about 24 percent — while the population of the group as a whole rose only 5 percent. In 2004, there were 2,888 deaths from overdoses in that group; in 2014, the number totaled 7,558.

Mark Hayward, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, said mortality rates are one of the most sensitive measures of quality of life.

For young, non-Hispanic whites, the death rate from accidental poisoning, which is mostly drug overdoses, rose from 6 to 30 per 100,000 from 1999 to 2014, and the suicide rate rose to 19.5 per 100,000 from 15, the New York Times analysis found.

For non-Hispanic whites ages 35 to 44, the accidental poisoning rate rose to 29.9 from 9.6 in that period. And for non-Hispanic whites 45 to 54, the poisoning rate rose to 29.9 per 100,000 from 6.7, and the suicide rate rose to 26 per 100,000 from 16, the newspaper's analysis found

But deaths from the traditional killers for which treatment has greatly improved over the past decade — heart disease, HIV and cancer — went down.

Tampa Bay Times,Column: Protect patients' access to effective drugs,"Imagine for a moment that you're living with a serious chronic illness or a rare medical condition.

Finding an optimal treatment has been a challenge for you and your doctor. You've tried a few medications, and you both have finally found a treatment that works especially well for you — the drug is well tolerated, you're getting relief from your condition, and your doctor is pleased with the clinical results. Plus, the drug is covered by your health insurance plan, and you can afford the co-payments.

Now imagine that — for no medical reason — your insurance plan suddenly removes a drug from its list of covered medications, or even moves that drug to a higher tier, increasing your co-pay and making it unaffordable for you.

Perhaps you don't have to imagine this scenario, because you are one of the many Floridians for whom this is a reality. Your health insurer or health plan's pharmacy benefit manager has effectively forced you to switch from the treatment that was keeping you healthy.

And if you're living with a complex, infectious, chronic or rare condition, this treatment switch could put your health at risk, potentially causing adverse side effects and even decreasing the effectiveness of your original medication. In fact, one recent study of Crohn's disease patients found that switching from one therapy to another was associated with loss of effectiveness of the medication within one year.

While health plans initiate these treatment switches to cut cost, the reality is that they can actually increase systemwide costs, especially when patients with complex diseases are switched. Not only can these unnecessary treatment switches lead to serious health consequences and reduced quality of life, they also translate to expensive emergency room visits, hospitalizations, additional physician visits and lab tests.

Fortunately, the Florida Legislature has the chance to protect vulnerable Floridians living with complex, infectious, chronic or rare medical conditions.

Legislation known as the Patient Stability Act (HB 915 / SB 1142), now pending before the Legislature, would keep commercial health plans and pharmacy benefit managers from pulling the rug out from Floridians who need their life-saving medications the most. The legislation would allow patients who are suffering from complex, infectious, chronic and rare medical conditions and are stable on their current medication the ability to remain on that medication as long as they maintain coverage through the same health plan.

Additionally, it would prevent health plans and pharmacy benefit managers in the state from increasing these patients' out-of-pocket costs mid-plan year or moving the medication to a more restrictive and inaccessible drug tier during the health plan year.

Insured Floridians, especially those living with debilitating health conditions like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, cancer, epilepsy or lupus shouldn't have to live in fear that the insurance coverage they signed up for won't be the coverage they receive. State legislators should enact the Patient Stability Act.

Tampa Bay Times,FDA eases restrictions on blood donations from gay men,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has officially ended its policy that blocked gay and bisexual men from donating blood.

The new policy, announced Monday, allows these men to donate blood on the condition that they are HIV-free and have not had sex with another man for at least one year.

The one-year deferral treats men who have sex with men the same as people in other groups that face an increased risk of having the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. For instance, people who received a blood transfusion must wait one year before donating blood. The same goes for those, such as medical workers, who accidentally came into contact with someone else's blood through an open wound or a needle stick.

The switch in policy could increase the U.S. blood supply by 2 percent to 4 percent by making 2 million additional men eligible to donate, according to previous research by UCLA's Williams Institute.

Men and women who have ever tested positive for HIV continue to face an indefinite ban on becoming blood donors, as do people with a history of nonprescription injection drug use and people who have ever exchanged sex for money or drugs, according to the new FDA policy.

""The FDA's responsibility is to maintain a high level of blood product safety for people whose lives depend on it,"" said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the FDA's acting commissioner, in a statement. ""We have taken great care to ensure this policy revision is backed by sound science.""

The federal agency did not make the change lightly. It spent several years evaluating epidemiological data from around the world and using statistical models to determine whether the lifetime ban on blood donations from men who have sex with men could be safely eased.

Late last year, an independent panel of experts concluded that a one-year deferral would not bring added risk to the blood supply. A few weeks later, the FDA said it planned to change its policy to allow gay and bisexual men to donate blood for the first time since the early days of the AIDS epidemic three decades ago.

Gay rights activists said the new policy is a ""step in the right direction,"" but falls short.

""It continues to stigmatize gay and bisexual men,"" said David Stacy of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest U.S. gay rights group. ""It simply cannot be justified in light of current scientific research and updated blood screening technology.""

The new rules bring the United States in line with Britain, Sweden, Japan and Australia, all of which have dropped lifetime bans on men who have sex with men in favor of one-year deferrals.

After Australia made the switch from an indefinite ban to a one-year deferral in 2000, researchers tested more than 8 million samples of donated blood and found no change in the safety of the country's blood supply, according to the FDA. No studies have evaluated whether a shorter deferral period would also be safe, the agency noted.

The FDA noted that its efforts to protect the nation's blood supply have drastically reduced the risk of spreading HIV through blood transfusions. That risk is now 1 in 1.47 million, down from 1 in 2,500 in the mid 1980s, before HIV testing became available.

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Saving money by hurting sick kids,"The state of Florida should not balance its budget on the backs of sick children. But that is exactly what state health officials have done since May, when they kicked about 9,000 children out of a health care program by using a deceptive screening tool. Department of Health officials should reinstate eligible children immediately. It is unconscionable that the state would abandon some of its most vulnerable residents to cut costs.

Children's Medical Services is a state-funded collection of programs for children with special needs from low-income families. Typically, children became eligible for the services through Medicaid or Kidcare, a low-cost health insurance program. According to a recent report in the Miami Herald, CMS was essentially a victim of its own success. The program's Medicaid claims grew by nearly $100 million from 2010 to 2014, from $713.3 to $811.1 million. To control costs, lawmakers in 2011 changed CMS from a fee-for-service plan, in which insurers paid doctors for treating sick children, into state-run managed care, where a predetermined pot of money was divided by insurers.

In May, Health Department officials determined that they could cut costs and comply with state law by eliminating children from CMS. The department introduced a screening tool that included a trick question about participating children's limitations. Many parents' hopeful answers for their children's future or their belief the question referred only to life-threatening injuries resulted in an answer of ""no."" The state responded by booting them from the program, a callous move that even some of the Johns Hopkins University doctors who created the questions say violates their original intent.

Tallahassee's Reema Shabaneh's two children were kicked out of CMS. The children, 6 and 9, are nearly blind and have severe retinal detachment. Other children ejected from the program include some with HIV/AIDS, severe facial deformities and patients with liver transplants who will need anti-rejection drugs for life. In all, about 9,000 children lost the state aid. Shabaneh's children were reinstated after she sued the state with the help of a law clinic at Florida State University. Good for them. But who will stand up for the others?

The Health Department denies it has intentionally used the screening tool or other means to save money by reducing access to health care for sick children from poor families, but the results are clear. An administrative law judge ruled the Health Department could not use the screening tool without adopting it through a rulemaking process, and the state has been working on a revised screen and expects to reopen the program next month. The department needs to figure out which children are truly eligible for CMS programs, but it shouldn't use trickery to do it.

It is bad enough that the state turned its back on sick kids who have no other reasonable options for specialized care. But what's worse is the state is resorting to such unconscionable measures at a time when Florida is enjoying a modest budget surplus. Gov. Rick Scott is asking lawmakers for $1 billion in tax cuts that primarily benefit businesses while the state scrimps on health care to poor and needy families.

Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, has a son with Down syndrome and is a longtime advocate for children with special needs. He has asked the state to explain its actions. While we wait for an answer, lawmakers should find a way to restore CMS's funding and revisit the 2011 law that changed its payment structure. Keeping Floridians healthy, especially its neediest children, is a responsibility the state should honor rather than shirk in the name of dollars and cents.",11/12/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Valrico's Village Players continues with Rent this weekend,"VALRICO — This month marks the final production of the season for the Village Players and the nonprofit, open-door ensemble has chosen the rock musical Rent to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the historic James McCabe Theater.

It's a bit of a departure from its usual dinner theater and murder mystery style shows.

Gail Pierce, vice president of the Village Players, an instructional theater that teaches acting, sound, lighting and stage management in Valrico, said it's worth producing.

""It's a little controversial, and people have a bit of a problem with it,"" she said, noting the theater has published its R rating and will check IDs at the gate. ""We do believe everything has its place.""

Rent is about struggling young New York artists living in a sexually charged HIV/AIDS world at Christmastime. Performances continue at 8 tonight, 3 p.m. Saturday and 8 p.m. Dec. 18-19 at the James McCabe Theatre, 506 N Fifth St.

Tickets for Rent are $15, or $13 for students, seniors and military. Reserved seating for groups of 10 or more are available for $12 each by calling (813) 480-3147.

Many actors are high school aged and novices because the troupe maintains an edict of having roles for new actors in every show.

The McCabe, originally constructed to house the Valrico Civic Club in 1915, stands as the only remaining commercial structure in Valrico dating to the turn of the century. Pierce said the organization has replaced the roof of the building three times, with money raised from donations, during her nearly 40 years overseeing operations.

Next year, Pierce said she is excited to announce a lineup that includes Sherlock Holmes, which premieres Jan. 22, and an adult version of The Little Mermaid in the spring. Pierce also said she has obtained the rights to Andrew Lloyd Webber's School of Rock musical, which he released prior to the show opening Sunday on Broadway.

Tampa Bay Times,"State purges 9,000 children from medical system in cost-saving overhaul","Six-year-old Aref Shabaneh is almost entirely blind, able to read only in Braille, walks with a cane, and is so sensitive to light his parents turn them off when he's home. For two years, he was enrolled in a taxpayer-funded health care program that provided specialists to help protect what little is left of his eyesight.

In June, Florida health administrators declared in a memo that the little boy was ""NOT clinically eligible.""

His severely detached retina had not been miraculously cured by doctors. Instead, state records show, Aref had been tossed from the program by state health employees looking to cut costs. They made the move after his mother failed to see the trap door hidden in a questionnaire from the Florida Department of Health — a ""screening tool"" that one judge declared invalid in September, but the Department of Health is fighting to reinstate.

Emails and other records obtained by the Herald show the screening process imposed earlier this year was part of a deliberate attempt to reduce spending on kids like Aref — by making the number of youngsters in a program called Children's Medical Services shrink to line up with the money the state wanted to spend.

""I was in deep shock,"" mother Reena Shabaneh said after a CMS nurse called to tell her both Aref and his older sister — who also suffers from retinal detachment and has severe vision problems — were removed from the program. ""I went crazy. I did everything I was told. I didn't know what was the problem.""

Aref is among about 9,000 Florida children who have been purged from Children's Medical Services since May as part of a wholesale reorganization of the program in conjunction with a new state law. The law, passed in 2011, changed CMS from a Medicare-like fee-for-service plan, where the child goes to a doctor and the insurer pays the bill, into state-run managed care, in which the state sets aside a pot of money — which is capped — and hires insurers to divvy it up.

The overhaul of CMS is a story about rationing of services for children who are poor and disabled, a long tradition in Florida. It is about the malleable nature of words like ""moratorium,"" and about numbers on a balance sheet. It is also about individuals represented by those numbers — kids like Aref.

""This is definitely rationing of care,"" said former CMS division chief Phyllis Sloyer, a process that has forced administrators to choose which Florida children are ""the sickest of the sick.""

""I know what the system is like to try to access,"" said Sloyer, who was a CMS administrator from 1979 through 2011, the latter 14 years as division chief. ""The families don't know how to advocate. That was not their role. Their role was to go to somebody and say 'I need help with my child.' CMS care coordinators were there to advocate for them, and to help them get what they needed. They knew the system, and knew how to work it.""

In an interview Friday morning, health department administrators emphasized their commitment to operating a high-quality health care system for children with special medical needs, saying recent overhauls of CMS were made in order to bring the program into compliance with state law.

More than 2,200 primary care doctors, and more than 16,000 specialists, participate in the CMS health care plans, state Surgeon General John Armstrong said, asserting that the program remains as strong as ever.

""We are dedicated to the care of children with serious and chronic medical conditions, and their families,"" said Armstrong, who heads the Department of Health. ""We want every child in Florida to achieve his or her full potential. And this program is so important for the medically fragile children in the state.""

The Miami Herald obtained thousands of pages of health department documents under the state's public records law, including nearly 800 emails and hundreds of memos and reports that detailed the state's plan to ""restructure"" CMS. They show that the elimination of children from CMS was the result of a plan to slash spending on sick kids at a time when Florida had a $635.4 million surplus. For the legislative session that begins next month, Gov. Rick Scott has proposed $1 billion in new tax cuts. The spending plan would eliminate an additional 718 health department positions.

For the parents of kids like Aref and his sister, who also is nearly blind, the restructuring has brought added pain to the struggle of raising a fragile child.

The parents of one Palm Beach County infant learned on the eve of a critical craniofacial surgery that their 6-month-old son had been ""screened out"" of CMS. The little boy is profoundly disabled, records show, having been born deaf, without eyes, and with a disfiguring cleft palate. The child's mother called CMS in preparation for the surgery, only to be told ""the screening is showing 'NO,' so they would not do anything.""

""URGENT"" read the subject line of a Feb. 2 internal email. ""There is nothing that we can do?""

There was something they could do.. Within a few days, the infant was re-enrolled. Thousands of other youngsters, though, did not fare as well.

Paying the cost for excellence

""In the late '80s and '90s, Florida was a beacon for great health care, regardless of someone's walk of life. It was really a true center of excellence for health care in the South,"" said Eric Stelnicki, a Hollywood craniofacial surgeon who treats children with cleft palate disorders. But excellence came at a cost.

CMS' success generated new demands for care. Florida lawmakers took notice and became disturbed by the program's growth.

Children who are medically eligible can join CMS two ways, either through the state's Medicaid program for children in poverty, or through KidCare, a state-run insurer for families that make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford insurance. The lion's share of kids entering CMS receive Medicaid, and, among them, enrollment leapfrogged from 58,843 in budget year 2010 to 70,513 by 2014.

Increased enrollment meant more spending. CMS Medicaid claims increased by nearly $100 million from 2010 to 2014, from $713.3 million to $811.1 million, according to the state Office of Program Policy Analysis & Government Accountability, the research arm of the Florida Legislature.

The state hit on a handful of remedies:

• Reduce the number of children eligible for services.

• Cut the payroll — 170 positions, including nurses doctors and caseworkers, were eliminated.

• Curtail funding for specialized clinics that treat children with facial deformities, such as cleft palates. At least two of the clinics were forced to shut down.

• Cease payment for expensive food items that can, among other benefits, prevent children with metabolic disorders from suffering permanent brain damage.

The way the state reduced the number of eligible children has caused a big stir, among academics as well as parents. Critics blamed the ""screening tool,"" which consists of five questions asked of the parents of children with disabling illnesses. One of those questions, No. 3, is a trap, they say — one that exploits the yearning of every parent of a sick or disabled child to believe that their son or daughter can live a normal life.

The question: ""Is your child limited or prevented in any way in his or her ability to do the things most children of the same age can do?""

Give the wrong answer — no — and your child is eliminated.

""These kids may be able to play baseball, and they may be able to go to school. But, of course, that doesn't mean they are 'normal,' "" Stelnicki said.

Florida long has rationed care and services to Floridians with chronic health needs and disabilities. The largest community-based program for children and adults with developmental disabilities — such as autism, cerebral palsy and mental retardation — has a waiting list with more than 21,000, all of whom already were deemed eligible. A separate program for frail elders and other disabled adults hoping to avoid costly nursing home care has another 32,000 Floridians on a wait list.

Last December, a federal court judge in Miami ruled that the state's Medicaid program left impoverished children with a second-rate health care system that is so poorly funded it violates federal law. In the meantime, though, as issues in the suit remain pending, the health department has drained even more money from the CMS safety net program.

It is the state's Medicaid program into which most of the children who are purged from CMS will be transitioned. And Sloyer, the CMS chief until 2012, says Medicaid doesn't do much of what CMS offers, such as providing care coordinators to help parents access therapy and medication, and organizing one-stop clinics for kids with sickle cell disease, HIV or cleft palates.

""I'm sorry, but the (Medicaid) health plans don't have that. That's not in their mix,"" Sloyer said. ""If somebody were to swear on a stack of Bibles that (Medicaid) could meet the needs of these children, I'd say 'fine.' But I don't believe it.""

The lion's share of CMS enrollees — or 78,000, as of June — became eligible through Medicaid, the state's primary insurer for the most impoverished Floridians. Another 15,000 children became eligible for CMS through KidCare. A Health Department memo from July said Kidcare enrollment in CMS was higher than the department had anticipated.

Enter the screening tool, which was developed by a team of doctors and scholars at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Christina Bethell, a public health professor, headed the team.

Bethell said question No. 3 was added to the assessment tool late in its development, and the intent was to include a small number of mostly developmentally disabled children who, while seemingly healthy, can be significantly limited in their ability to function and perform to the same level of their typically developing peers.

Children with cognitive impairments or cerebral palsy, for example, sometimes do not need medications or frequent visits to the doctor, but they nonetheless can require constant oversight and therapy.

Paul Newacheck, a retired emeritus professor of Health Policy and Pediatrics at the University of California in San Francisco, who also worked on the assessment tool's development, said the screener ""was designed principally for use in surveys, not for eligibility determination… to estimate the number of children with special health care needs in a population. The creators did not have eligibility determination in mind when it was created.""

According to a July 2015 health department memo, Florida saw the screening tool instead as a mechanism for reducing services. The memo said administrators anticipated that enrollment of KidCare children ""will be in alignment with the appropriated average monthly caseload as a result of the screening project,"" meaning the number of kids would align with the amount of allocated dollars.

Bethell, who is ""horrified"" by Florida's use of the screener, said many parents, steeped in hope despite the objective reality of their child's condition, will say ""no"" to question No. 3 as a way to deny that their child is different.

""It's a very hard question for people to say 'yes' to,"" Bethell said.

Celia Kirsch's 15-year-old son, Elijah, is a CMS patient with epilepsy, migraines, asthma, kidney malfunction and bladder problems, who has had several surgeries to repair a cleft palate. ""Nobody wants to openly say my child isn't like other children,"" she said.

Added Rex Northup, who heads the CMS office in Pensacola: ""Many of these families have a vision of their children: Yes, my child has special needs, but he's not severely handicapped."" The question, Northup said, ""was a little salt in those wounds. It's saying, 'I want you to acknowledge to me that your child is different.'

""They've been spending their lives trying to convince people that their children, in the ways that mattered, were no different,"" Northup added.

Rachelle Haro-Adkins is a social worker who adopted two small children from the state's foster care system, both of whom were born with cleft palates. Her daughter, Casey, has undergone more than eight surgeries to correct the deformity, and has seen speech therapists for most of her childhood to correct the condition's affects. She's had bones grafted from her hip to her mouth to sustain a dental implant, and still has the braces she's worn for eight years. She sometimes finds it hard to be understood.

But when a CMS screener asked Haro-Adkins if her daughter was ""limited or prevented,"" she answered ""no"" because the teen's surgeon said Casey will not require additional surgeries — though her face retains tell-tale signs of her condition. Haro-Adkins said she wishes her daughter still had access to a CMS cleft palate clinic that specialized in treating children like Casey. ""I could trust that, with the team of doctors and specialists, she would get whatever it is she needs,"" Haro-Adkins said.

""I was disappointed,"" she said of her daughter's removal from CMS. ""It's exhausting dealing with all the Medicaid issues.""

Records show agency administrators knew the questionnaire would prove daunting for many families, and not just because it asked them to acknowledge their children were different. In an April email, an agency head said she had revised a letter sent to parents whose children would be rescreened so that it could be understood by a fourth-grader. The letter, she added, should contain mostly ""one syllable words and as few sentences as possible.""

Bethell said she believes health administrators deliberately misused her creation for the purpose of shedding enrollment. Health Department records show that administrators had a specific goal in mind, although the records obtained by the Herald don't make clear what that goal was. A draft of a CMS ""Three-Year Strategic Plan"" dated June 24, 2015, includes this item as a Strategic Objective: ""By December 31, 2015, the (CMS) use of a new screening tool will limit enrollment to children with chronic and serious conditions who have special healthcare needs, resulting in an overall enrollment decrease of XX percent.""

The ""XX"" was not specified.

Said Bethell: ""I'm very worried about the children in Florida right now.""

The records obtained by the Herald show that, in February, the Health Department conducted two pilot projects testing enrollment tools. In the first pilot, a different proposed screener left the eligibility of around 25 percent of the children tested — 221 out of 877 kids — undetermined. Administrators would have had to conduct costly and time-consuming medical record reviews to ascertain eligibility.

In the second pilot, using the Johns Hopkins screener, one in every three previously eligible children was removed. A memo the Herald obtained dated April 17 said: ""With the new screening tool, CMS has projected that 38 percent of enrolled children will no longer meet clinical eligibility requirements.""

A work group that conducted the pilot recommended that the nurses who administered the test ask follow-up questions to those parents, which was expected to bring the group of children purged from enrollment down to about 24 percent.

In the aftermath of the purge, health administrators used a prepared script to explain the wave of removals, records show. An internal memo suggested screeners tell parents the assessment tool was redesigned partly ""to allow a survey method more focused on parent input.""

Stelnicki, a facial surgeon at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood who treats CMS children with cleft palates, said several of his patients — some of whom still have disabling deformities — were eliminated after their parents gave the wrong answer to the third question.

""I have a child with metal plates attached to a bone inside his mouth that need to be removed. He was kicked out due to question three,"" Stelnicki said. ""His orthodontist called me and asked, 'what do we do now?' The youngster, he said, will be at increased risk of infection if the plates aren't removed, and they likely will impede his speech development and dental health. ""Even if I do the work for free, I'll need an anesthesiologist to take the metal plates out of his mouth. No hospital will take this kid for free.""

If doctors don't continue to treat such children without charging, ""these kids will have to live their lives unable to chew properly, unable to speak properly and they will have deformed faces that will stigmatize them and prevent them from living a totally 'normal' life,"" Stelnicki said.

Use of the tool also eliminated children who had liver transplants and require expensive anti-rejection drugs to sustain their new organs, as well as children with HIV and AIDS, who will require anti-viral medications for the rest of their lives, Stelnicki said. He said he fears some of those youngsters will enter a vicious cycle: ""They won't be able to afford their medications, and they'll get sick again. Then, they'll qualify for CMS again.""

Jennifer Tschetter, the health department's chief operating officer, told the Herald Friday the state had no choice but to deploy the new screening tool after lawmakers required that children have both chronic and serious medical conditions to qualify for CMS, and the Johns Hopkins questionnaire was the best method for measuring seriousness. Tschetter said she has spoken with Bethell recently, and the scholar no longer objects to the way Florida is using the tool. In an email, Bethell stood by her comments to the Herald.

Tschetter said administrators have revised a training guide for the tool to minimize the chances that a deserving child is declared ineligible, and are now proposing that youngsters with certain conditions be given automatic access to the program.

Aref Shabaneh, and his older sister, Yasmeen, were among the thousands of Florida children whose disabilities suddenly were not serious enough to remain in CMS.

Doctors are not sure why, but both of Reema Shabaneh's children suffer from severe retinal detachment. Aref's vision is worse than his 9-year-old sister's. He can read only with a Braille device, and walks with the use of a cane. Aref's sixth surgery was last June. Doctors scraped calcium from his corneas, and the boy had to lay in bed for days afterward.

""It was so terrible,"" his mother said. ""Painful.""

Yasmeen does not play with other children at school, because even a minor jolt could result in her retinas becoming unhinged. ""Just sitting in class, Shabaneh said, ""her retina can detach.""

But when a CMS worker administered the state's new screener in June, Shabaneh said she understood the third question to apply only to children with life-threatening conditions, such as cancer or paralysis. Notes typed by an employee who spoke with Shabaneh later described her as confused, saying ""Mom has a hard time understanding.""

An agency nurse called with the news: both youngsters were removed from the program. ""I was in shock,"" Shabaneh said.

""I said to them 'My children are blind. What more do you want than that'?""

Shabaneh sued the state, with the help of a Florida State University law school clinic, and her two children were reinstated.

In August, about 20 CMS medical directors and assistant directors wrote a searing letter to the state, accusing the Health Department of ""dismantling"" the health care program. One of the directors claimed that administrators had placed a ""moratorium"" on all new enrollments, making frail and disabled children wait months until the state had first rescreened about 70,000 children who already were enrolled. Health administrators denied the claim, and have continued to do so since.

""There is no moratorium on new admissions to the CMS Plan,"" a Health Department spokeswoman told the Herald on Aug. 26. ""Presently, new enrollees are being added to the CMS Plan through the screening process daily.""

The agency's records, though, show that behind the scenes, as health administrators were denying the existence of a ""moratorium,"" they had ceased virtually all new screenings — a prerequisite to enrollment.

In a script administrators prepared in the spring for CMS staff, employees were told to answer this way when parents called asking about their child's status: ""Thank you for your call. Currently, screening activities are temporarily suspended while an upgrade of the Children's Medical Services Network Eligibility Screening Guide and related systems is completed. Screening activities will resume in May.""

The screenings did not resume in May. In a memo to staff on May 21, the new script read: ""Children's Medical Services is working on a system upgrade, and we are unsure at this time how long that may take. CMS is unable to conduct new screenings for their program at this time."" The screenings remained suspended when, in September, a judge halted them altogether, ordering the state to formally adopt the new screener, or an alternative tool, as an agency ""rule.""

The CMS medical director in Jacksonville, Jeffrey Goldhagen, said that, in his area alone, between 2,500 and 3,000 children ""have been denied access [as they] have to be assessed in order to see whether or not they can be in CMS in the future."" One of Goldhagen's patients, he said, is a boy who was paralyzed in a car wreck. The boy is in a hospice program, receiving only palliative care, Goldhagen said, because ""we couldn't get him in to a CMS brain injury program.""

A CMS assistant medical director from Brevard County, William Knappenberger, beseeched his boss, CMS director Cassandra Pasley, in an April 29 email to reconsider the enrollment hold ""as quickly as possible.""

""The fact that (newborn intensive care) graduates will not have access to CMS for a protracted period of time, and that this lack of access is being created by our own internal 'bookkeeping,' is inappropriate and medically hazardous,"" Knappenberger wrote. ""Their first month after discharge is the most likely time for ... mortality.""

Knappenberger added: ""Denying access to fragile infants is unreasonable.""

Rex Northup, the CMS medical director in Pensacola, said he, too, argued with health administrators not to curtail enrollment, particularly for newborns with severe cardiac, liver or other ailments. ""There are babies coming out of intensive care nurseries across the state who are at extreme risk. We're asking them to leave the nursery and wait in line. They could be in extreme trouble for a day or two without appropriate oversight and intervention — much less six weeks.""

""We've got children with artificial airways, tracheostomies, gastrostomies — children going home with ventilators. And my suggestion was, how about we give those children a pass so they can enroll immediately into the program?,"" Northup said.

""They said, 'Mmmmm, nah. We'll pass on it',"" Northup added. ""The most medically complex of kids are required go through this same screening,"" the doctor said, adding they were being required to wait months for care they needed right then.

On Friday, the health department's secretary, Armstrong, maintained ""there has never been a moratorium for screening eligibility into the [CMS] managed care plan.""

But when a reporter shared agency emails with the administrators, Tschetter said it was more appropriate to call the halt in new screenings a change in ""focus"" from new enrollments to determining whether existing patients were in the program properly. Administrators say children have been enrolled in the program throughout the rescreening period.

Tandora Williams has been raising her 7-year-old grandson since her son was slain in a drive-by shooting last January. The boy, Joey Delanor Delancy Jr., is diagnosed with a variety of impairments, including autism, bipolar disorder, ADHD and asthma. Williams is disabled, too, with screws in both her legs, arthritic-type problems in both hands, high-blood pressure and heart disease. Williams said she already has suffered two heart attacks.

Joey is a handful. He has trouble with speech and understanding language, and has difficulty pronouncing the first letter of most words. He won't sit still. He wants desperately to be like the other kids, and has crying jags when he realizes he isn't. Williams uses the bus to take Joey to therapy and neurology appointments in Weston and Fort Lauderdale. She uses an umbrella instead of a cane, she says, because she doesn't want to look like an old lady.

Joey's doctor prescribed a medication that will help him sleep at night, and it has a side benefit, as well. ""The doctor said, 'when you give it to him, you go to sleep.' That's when I can go to sleep,"" Williams said.

Last summer, Joey's doctor at Pediatric Associates in Hollywood recommended the boy be enrolled in CMS so caseworkers could relieve some of the pressure on Williams, his sole caregiver. The 56-year-old grandmother said it took her doctor four tries over several weeks to get Joey enrolled. Or, at least she thought he was enrolled.

When Williams takes the boy to appointments, they say he is still not in the program.

""Right now they say he is enrolled,"" Williams said. ""but when I go to get medicine, they say he is not enrolled.""

Overall health department spending has remained flat in recent years, though the agency's budget declined slightly over the past year from $2.99 billion to $2.83 billion, a spokeswoman said. CMS anticipated a spread of nearly $60 million between health care expenses and what lawmakers had budgeted.

Rather than set aside more money to close the gap, Gov. Rick Scott set about cutting.

During the state's last lawmaking session, Scott's proposed budget eliminated 1,100 state jobs — 700 of them from the Department of Health. Minutes from a Feb. 27 staff meeting say the ""Governor's budget is 'proposing' 109 positions be cut from CMS"" alone.

The Feb. 27 minutes added: ""CMS will need to look at restructuring.""

Sloyer, who ran the program for 14 years, says the constant cutting appears to be leading to an inevitable end: the elimination of CMS as a health care program altogether. ""The service delivery arm of CMS — the clinics, the care coordinators, the provider network — if you look at the number of children being removed from the program, you have to question whether you've got a viable program.""

Said Bethell from Johns Hopkins: ""It's a very shortsighted view. These are children who will not function well in school, or in life. They are the ones who are going to end up costing society a lot more later on.""",06/12/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Monday's letters: Great wealth's promise and peril,"Facebook CEO's pledge a stunner | Dec. 2

Great wealth's promise and peril

The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, announced that he is donating $45 billion to help mankind. I hope he succeeds.

However, I caution those who think that money fixes all problems. Here in Hillsborough County, we saw what happened with the Bill and Melinda Gates $100 million grant to the public school system. It took a while to recognize the damage, but now everybody — conservatives and progressives, as well as teachers, administrators and students — can see how the program hurt Hillsborough County teachers, students and taxpayers.

I hope and pray that, if Zuckerberg indeed gives away 99 percent of his Facebook stock, he figures out how to do it in a way that will not destroy the very things he is trying to fix.

Vigilance on HIV/AIDS | Dec. 1, editorial

U.S. must lead the fight

Thank you for your editorial and for Ernest Hooper's column on the rising rate of HIV in Florida and the danger of not recognizing HIV/AIDS as the frightening disease that it is. These latest statistics should spur us to support increased funding for AIDS prevention and treatment not only in our state, but in other countries as well. AIDS does not respect international borders.

New information from the World Health Organization shows that tuberculosis is also at the top of the list of communicable killer diseases. TB often occurs alongside AIDS, and the tragedy is that both are preventable. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is a public/private organization that raises and invests money in proven programs run at the local level in nations fighting these diseases. The United States must continue to be a leader in this fight, for our own sake and the sake of others.

Kriseman gets part of wish list | Dec. 4

Making the most of the bay

Thanks to the Times, over the years we have been informed of a local group, Ride the Tide Tampa Bay, which has worked to raise awareness of the potential for ferry service on our magnificent bay. This article shows their work has paid off. The City Council has approved a ferry pilot program and the restoration of a research ship. What a great way to remind our visitors that we are a coastal city.

We can hope that the city doesn't rush into this pilot program and allots enough time for numerous ferry companies to submit a bid. In particular, we need to find ferry companies that use or plan to use the greenest technology possible on their boats.

Volunteers help with the trail

There have been a number of interesting and informative articles on the Fred E. Marquis Pinellas Trail, but none mentioned the core of volunteer ""auxiliary"" rangers who ride various parts of the trail. At any given time more than 100 volunteers serve in some trail-related capacity.

Among the many services the rangers provide are sweeping off broken glass and removing branches and debris after rain, replacing bollards, helping bikers with information or bike repair and getting help when needed for bikers in distress. The park system in Pinellas, including this ""linear"" park, is a wonderful gift to residents and tourists alike.

Tampa Bay Times,"World AIDS Day offers HIV education, testing across Tampa Bay","When Shelley Taylor-Donahue started working with HIV and AIDS patients in the late 1980s, there was very little she could do to save lives.

""Everybody was dying,"" she said. ""We were going to funerals.""

She said that's not the case anymore.

Thanks to medical breakthroughs, it's easier to save lives.

Thanks to improved sex education, the public is better equipped to prevent the spread of the disease.

And thanks to increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBT community, it has become easier to talk openly about the social stigma that HIV and AIDS are exclusive to gay people.

So today, for World AIDS Day, Taylor-Donahue, the HIV and AIDS program coordinator with the Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County, will set up shop in the middle of Williams Park in downtown St. Petersburg to talk about HIV.

There will be food and live entertainment, goodie bags and free condoms at every booth.

Most importantly, there will be free testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

""It's always good to know your status,"" Taylor-Donahue said.

RESURGENCE: New HIV infections are on the rise in Florida

The health department, in collaboration with other HIV-awareness organizations through the Pinellas Planning Partnership, will offer rapid testing, which requires a quick finger stick and produces results within 20 minutes.

For those who don't want their blood drawn, a cotton swab test will be available, though the results are not immediate.

Usually, between 100 and 200 people come to the Williams Park World AIDS Day event. But Taylor-Donahue said she hopes the attention actor Charlie Sheen received since revealing his HIV-positive status might inspire more people to get tested.

""Florida has now surpassed New York in new HIV infections,"" she said, ""and this is something we don't want to be No. 1 at.""

The Sunshine State has the highest number of new HIV diagnoses in the nation, with Hillsborough and Pinellas counties posting some of the biggest increases in Florida.

From 2012 to 2014, Hillsborough County diagnoses of HIV increased 63 percent. In Pinellas County, they jumped 32 percent.

A complacency among young people — and, surprisingly, the elderly — could be to blame for the uptick.

For those ages 18 to 32, HIV awareness isn't as heightened because most people in that age group didn't live through the height of the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, said Hillsborough County Health Department spokesman Steve Huard.

In older demographics, the popularity of performance-enhancing drugs like Viagra have made retirement communities more sexually active, Huard said, and therefore more prone to sexually transmitted diseases.

Because they're not afraid of getting pregnant, senior citizens are also less likely to wear condoms.

""They're not thinking it's in their population,"" Taylor-Donahue said. ""HIV is a human disease. It doesn't discriminate.""

Taylor-Donahue and Huard said drug treatments have become so successful at preventing the progression of the disease that many HIV-positive people are now dying of old age — not as a result of the disease itself.

""We have so many resources for people,"" Taylor-Donahue said. ""We can help you.""

But first, people need to get tested.

""If you don't, it could be just like the '80s,"" Taylor-Donahue said.

""We want to get to zero new infections to zero people dying,"" she added. ""I would love to work myself out of a job.""

Tampa Bay Times,Largo Commission candidate charged with extortion denies involvement,"LARGO — The City Commission candidate charged with trying to extort an opponent denied his involvement Tuesday.

Robert Avery, who was arrested Monday on a felony extortion charge, said someone must have hacked his computer in order to send an anonymous email from it to Aaron Darr, who also is running for commission Seat 3. According to the arrest report, Avery admitted to sending the email, in which the sender claimed to have damaging information, but Avery said that isn't true.

""These allegations are a surprise to me,"" Avery, 31, said. ""The police affidavit is beyond incorrect.""

The message, sent through Darr's campaign website about 2:15 a.m. Aug. 29, said the author had ""nice things the citizens of Largo will be seeing soon"" and for Darr to remember to ""never post anything digitally you wouldn't want your mom or partner to see."" It is signed ""A Largo Citizen that watches for crooked people.""

The contact email address is listed as [email protected] Police obtained the IP address of the sender and traced it back to Avery, according to the arrest report.

In a statement, Darr, 24, said he is in ""total disbelief"" that Avery would say the affidavit was false.

""It's offensive, it's disappointing and, above all, it's not the appropriate behavior someone running for office who will oversee and work with the Largo Police Department should be exhibiting in his public and private behavior,"" he said.

Police spokesman Lt. Paul Amodeo declined to comment on Avery's claim.

Darr said he has a hunch about what ""nice things"" the sender was referencing. In 2014, an ex-boyfriend sent Darr an email with a link containing personal photos, an experience he shared with a SaintPetersBlog reporter this year. Darr believes the sender of the most recent email saw the story and pretended to have the photos that the ex-boyfriend sent.

""I'm just going to let everything speak for itself,"" Darr said Tuesday. ""This is out of my hands.""

Darr, who identifies as a progressive, has not been one to hold back details about his personal life. At 17, he was diagnosed with HIV and has worked to raise awareness of issues facing those with HIV and AIDS. He said he plans to continue that involvement if he is elected as a commissioner and to focus on building Largo's economy through support of small businesses.

The felony charge doesn't affect Avery's candidacy in the Nov. 8 election unless he is convicted, which would cause him to lose his voting rights, City Clerk Diane Bruner said.

Avery, who has run for the commission once before, in 2010, said Tuesday that he plans to continue his campaign on a platform of lowering taxes, establishing term limits and handing over the Police Department to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. He'll depend on the people who know his character to help mend his reputation, he said, and believes that he will be cleared from blame.

""Once the courts have exonerated me for my charges,"" he said, ""then it's time to go after the people who did this and bring them to justice.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Editorial: Continue the fight against HIV, AIDS","Actor Charlie Sheen's recent announcement that he is HIV-positive is a powerful reminder that HIV/AIDS remains a global epidemic for which there is no cure. In the decades since the epidemic reached its height, medical advances have allowed people with the disease to live longer, healthier lives. The social stigma of being infected also has faded, a welcome change that has, improbably, ushered in a new, dangerous era of indifference. Today is World AIDS Day, an event that once garnered broad attention but now passes with little acknowledgement in far too many corners. HIV still remains the world's leading infectious killer. If left unchecked or ignored by a new generation that did not bear witness to its devastation, the disease has the potential to again spiral out of control.

Worldwide, 35 million people have HIV/AIDS. Most live in sub-Saharan Africa or other low- and middle-income countries. But relegating HIV to the continent of Africa and other poor nations would be a serious miscalculation. In the United States, 1.2 million people live with HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, nearly one in eight is unaware that he or she is infected. That is unacceptable and irresponsible given the ease and availability of testing.

Florida led the nation in 2013 with 5,377 newly diagnosed HIV cases. The Sunshine State also ranked third among states with the highest numbers of children under 13 with HIV infections. And Florida's numbers are going in the wrong direction, rising 14 percent in 2014. Hillsborough led bay area counties with 443 HIV cases, according to state records. This hardly suggests a disease on the wane.

The federal government's national strategy to stamp out HIV/AIDS calls for greater access to testing, treatment and preventive drugs, including PrEP, a daily pill that reduces the likelihood of HIV transmission by 92 percent when taken consistently. Officials are targeting prevention efforts at several at-risk populations, including gay and bisexual men, blacks, Latinos, people who inject drugs and youth ages 13 to 24. Southern states, which account for more than one-half of HIV diagnoses, and transgender women also are receiving special attention. This is a solid plan that should help lower infection rates, encourage testing and enable the infected to seek treatment.

Each of us has a responsibility to know our HIV/AIDS status. We also have a duty to educate youth who may be unaware of the devastation wrought by HIV/AIDS before drugs made it possible for people to better manage the disease. Today and always, the message should be clear. Without medical care, HIV leads to AIDS, a deadly disease that has claimed the lives of 39 million people worldwide and more than 650,000 people in the United States since the epidemic began. Even with all of the medical advances, 14,000 people in the United States lose their lives to HIV/AIDS each year. It shouldn't take celebrities to remind us of the dangers of HIV/AIDS and the need to forestall its progress and find a cure. The threat is far from over, and we must all work together to prevent this killer from spreading.",30/11/2015

Tampa Bay Times,AIDS activist arrives in NYC after rowing across Atlantic,"NEW YORK — A New Yorker who rowed across the Atlantic Ocean for AIDS awareness has arrived home in Brooklyn, ending a 21-month journey.

Victor Mooney arrived at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on Friday and plans a ceremony at the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday, he said Saturday.

""I'm happy to be in Brooklyn,"" Mooney said. ""I still haven't absorbed it.""

The 49-year-old rows in memory of his brother who died of AIDS in 1983. He said his goal is to spur people to get tested for HIV.

After failing on three previous attempts to row solo across the Atlantic, Mooney set off from the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa on Feb. 19, 2014.

He arrived at the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten in June 2014 and began making his way up the East Coast.

He lost 80 pounds and encountered numerous setbacks during the journey. He was robbed of his passport and food on an island off Haiti in November 2014; his passport was later recovered.

In August, the Coast Guard rescued him off North Carolina after his boat hit a submerged cypress stump and began taking on water. The boat was repaired, and he continued on his way.

Tampa Bay Times,Column: Time for White House to step up on TB,"The World Health Organization just released new data showing tuberculosis kills more people than even HIV/AIDS, and it called multidrug-resistant TB a public health crisis.

The news brought to my mind vivid memories from my work as a physician in southern Africa.

I cannot forget seeing an 8-year-old boy as he crawled outside to play with his friends. Being on all fours was not part of the fun but his only means of mobility. An infection in his knees, caused by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, left him unable to walk or stand.

While TB usually affects the lungs, in many children it occurs in other parts of the body.

Resilient in the face of his illness, he looked to the sky with a shy grin as the other children shouted ""crab, crab, come and get us, crab."" But the playful laughter was then replaced by silence: The young boy was killed by MDR-TB, and his sister and mother are also ill with disease.

In my 20 years of experience in treating children with this disease with Partners in Health, the Sentinel Project and others, this case, in the African nation of Lesotho, was one of the most heartbreaking.

Due to a lack of appropriate TB diagnostic tests and medications, this child was sick for months before the cause of his fevers and swollen knees became clear.

Even when the diagnosis was made, he was referred from facility to facility before a provider skilled enough to treat him could be located. The transportation cost for just one visit was more than the family's entire monthly income.

He wept silently when receiving his painful daily injections. Watching his small frame heave and struggle to swallow the multiple, bitter pills was almost too much for his mother to bear, and at times they simply both gave up.

Could this only happen in a place like Lesotho? Actually, there are about 100 cases of MDR-TB diagnosed in the United States each year. These lead to an additional 1,000 exposures and more than 300 infections with MDR-TB over a two- to three-year period, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In the United States, a case of MDR-TB can cost $400,000 to treat. Patients must take toxic medication daily for two to three years, often causing permanent hearing loss and other side effects.

In 2009, a teacher in a Laguna Beach, Calif., elementary school went to work not knowing she had MDR-TB, inadvertently infecting 31 children. Last year in Florida, 36 TB cases were found to be resistant to at least one TB drug and 10 cases of MDR-TB were confirmed, according to the Florida Department of Health. In Massachusetts, we already have seen six cases of MDR-TB so far this year.

Globally, the number of cases among children is bound to grow. Once on the right treatment, a patient usually becomes noninfectious, but most people with the disease are not receiving treatment, thus making spread to children more likely.

There is some good news. The White House is developing a National Action Plan for Combating Drug Resistant TB, which would put us on course to eliminate the threat of MDR-TB through prevention and treatment with promising new medications now becoming available. Some 560,000 people with drug-resistant TB would receive treatment under the plan over a five-year period. Last summer, 10 U.S. senators wrote to the president commending him for taking this initiative.

Unfortunately, many TB experts worry the president may fail to propose the funding increase required to implement the plan, because in recent years he has proposed not increases but rather substantial cuts to global TB funding. I have signed an appeal to the president, along with 600 other physicians and scientists, including 21 based in Florida, urging him to launch his plan without delay and propose the needed funding.

President Barack Obama has a chance to add to his legacy on global health by confronting the tuberculosis threat. For the sake of the children I am treating for MDR-TB and families affected by this disease, we must not delay. We cannot afford an action plan that just gathers dust on the shelf.

Tampa Bay Times,American killed in Mali worked to improve global health,"WASHINGTON — As a Peace Corps volunteer, expert in global health and the mother of a 7-year-old boy, Anita Ashok Datar devoted her life to caring for and helping others, her family said.

Datar, of Takoma Park, Md., was one of at least 19 people killed in Friday's terror attack on a hotel in Mali, the State Department confirmed in a statement.

No other U.S. citizens were believed to have died in the attack, carried out by heavily armed Islamic extremists at a Radisson hotel in the Malian capital of Bamako.

""We are devastated that Anita is gone,"" her family said in a statement issued through the State Department. ""It's unbelievable to us that she has been killed in this senseless act of violence and terrorism.""

Datar, 41, was a senior manager at Palladium Group, an international development organization with offices in Washington, her family said. As a public health expert, she focused on family planning and HIV issues, work that took her to Africa often in the past 15 years. She also worked in Asia and South America, according to her LinkedIn profile.

""Everything she did in her life she did to help others — as a mother, public health expert, daughter, sister and friend,"" the family statement said. ""And while we are angry and saddened that she has been killed, we know that she would want to promote education and health care to prevent violence and poverty at home and abroad, not intolerance.""

The family said that of all her accomplishments, Datar was ""most proud of her son."" Her Facebook page is filled with pictures of the boy.

Datar was born in Massachusetts, grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Rutgers, her family said. She worked in Senegal with the Peace Corps for more than two years and earned master's degrees in public health and public administration from Columbia.

Among other foreigners killed in the attack were six Russian employees of a cargo company, three senior executives of a Chinese state-owned rail construction company, two Belgians and an Israeli man, officials said Saturday.

Tampa Bay Times,Sunday's letters: Traffic problems need creative fix,"Neighbors will have a say on TBX interstate project | Nov. 14

Traffic problems need creative fix

All Tampa Bay should oppose the proposed I-275 toll road. First, the proposed plan will destroy 100 homes, 30 businesses, public gardens and a community center in the Tampa Heights-Seminole Heights area. Additionally, it would contaminate these two neighborhoods with a cesspool of noise and air pollution. During peak times, the toll for using this road from Bearss Avenue to downtown Tampa is estimated to be $18 per trip one way and $36 per round trip. All this for the sole purpose of saving commute time for well-heeled individuals.

History's lesson is that Tampa Bay's roadway expansions do not reduce congestion. Case in point: Millions were spent on the I-275 expansion from ""malfunction junction"" to West Shore. Just months after the completion, that section is just as congested as ever. Additionally, homes on the north side of I-275 and west of Lois Avenue are inundated with noise and pollution. Much of the shrubbery in the block nearest the exit ramp expansion is covered with black, oily soot. Thus, Tampa Bay earned the dubious distinction of being ranked No. 11 in the nation for traffic congestion, according to TomTom International.

Since expansions do not work, a paradigm shift is needed. The logical solution requires a 10 percent or more reduction of the number of cars on the road and a replacement mode of travel that is more comfortable, cheaper and faster for the commuting public. An initial solution could be the bus on shoulder system, or BOSS, which allows buses to use highway emergency lanes. BOSS could be coupled with a subsidized marriage to Lyft/Uber, which could move people from Point A (for instance, homes in a 10-mile radius around I-275 and Bearss Avenue) to Point B (an express bus hub located near Bearss and I-275). The same scenario would be repeated on I-4, I-75 and major thoroughfares. In addition, travel time and congestion could be reduced by synchronizing traffic signals.

It is past time to stop the single-minded approach of more pavement as the only means of dealing with traffic congestion.

Obama's complacency on terror | Nov. 17, commentary

Critics lack an alternative

It must be wonderful to be Marc Thiessen, sitting in the catbird seat and casting aspersions about President Barack Obama's ""complacency"" about ISIS, a thought echoed in several recent letters.

Nowhere in the column — or the letters — is there one sensible suggestion about what Obama or the United States should do. As with the Affordable Care Act, the critics haven't a shred of an alternative plan. Are they really asking that we deploy American troops to fight in Syria? Are they really recommending another ""surge,"" spending another $1.7 trillion (and counting) to be paid by our children in money and blood?

The plain fact is that American bungling in Iraq after 9/11 unleashed a hornet's nest of problems throughout the region, perhaps beyond anyone's control at this point. Frankly, I am grateful that we have a president who has steadfastly stood against plodding into yet another quagmire in Yemen, Libya, Syria or myriad other places.

Lawmakers propose needle exchange Nov. 2

Fight the spread of HIV

This article discusses a bill to authorize and evaluate a needle exchange program in Florida. The bill, the Infectious Disease Elimination Act, is good legislation. However, it's frustrating that a more expansive and advanced bill is not being introduced.

Florida has the second- and third-most cases of HIV and AIDS in the nation, respectively. Of those with HIV in the state, 20 percent contracted the virus through intravenous drug use. Florida cannot afford to wait until 2020 for a program to stop the spread of this disease.

Needle exchange is not a new HIV reduction and elimination strategy. Some 30 states have implemented programs. Surprisingly, even fairly conservative states such as Indiana and Kentucky have quickly pushed legislation through to allow for needle exchanges. Fear of increased drug abuse because of the availability of clean needles is unfounded.

Potential benefits of the IDEA Act bill are: provision of clean needles; proper disposal of used needles; access to drug treatment and medical care; and reduction in HIV, including mother-to-child transmission.

Florida needs to act quickly to reduce the number of HIV cases with legislation such as the IDEA Act, but also by taking steps to broaden the scope of the bill. Please join me in asking our legislators to support legislation to test the effectiveness of a needle exchange program in our state.

Refugee plan challenged | Nov. 17

Against our principles

More than half of U.S. governors would reject people fleeing persecution and repression because of their national origin or religion. The forces of terrorism are succeeding. They are persuading us to change one of the fundamental characteristics that has made this country great.

If we continue down this path, we'll need to give the Statue of Liberty back to France.

Jonathan K. Jaberg, Largo

Remember our history

It is unbelievable that many governors are refusing to accept the Syrian people, who have gone through hell, into their states. I agree that the vetting process has got to be at the highest level.

But we cannot forget history. During World War II, America turned shiploads of Jewish people away. They were refused in other countries and many died in the death camps. That is a blemish on our history.

Perhaps if these states would come up with a plan to monitor these people until this very long process is complete, they could stop these knee-jerk reactions to the report of one Syrian monster entering France with a stolen passport.

Please don't forget history and the suffering of the Jewish people because we were not sensitive to their plight. That is not who America is.

Tampa Bay Times,Charlie Sheen says he is HIV-positive; has been blackmailed,"NEW YORK — Former Two and a Half Men star Charlie Sheen has HIV.

In an interview Tuesday on NBC's Today, the 50-year-old actor said he tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS about four years ago, but that, thanks to a rigorous drug regimen, he's healthy.

When asked by co-host Matt Lauer if he had transmitted the disease to others, he declared, ""Impossible. Impossible,"" and insisted he had informed every sexual partner of his condition beforehand.

Since his diagnosis, he has had unprotected sex with only two partners, he said, adding, with no further clarification, ""They were under the care of my doctor, and they were completely warned ahead of time.""

He said one reason for going public with his condition was to put a stop to shakedowns from prostitutes and others who threatened to out him. He said one prostitute took a photo of the HIV-related drugs in his medicine cabinet and threatened to sell that photo to the tabloids.

He said he had paid ""enough to bring it into the millions"" — perhaps as much as $10 million — to buy their silence and now was seeking to ""put a stop to this barrage of attacks and sub-truths.""

""Are you still paying these people?"" Lauer asked him.

""Not after today I'm not,"" said Sheen, who during his appearance appeared jumpy and spoke in stuttering bursts.

He did not address when, and by whom, he may have been infected.

For part of the interview, Sheen was joined by his physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga, who said strong anti-viral drugs have suppressed the virus. The HIV level in Sheen's blood is ""undetectable,"" Huizenga said, and flatly stated that he does not have AIDS.

Tampa Bay Times,"Charlie Sheen says he has HIV, paid as much as $10M to keep it secret","NEW YORK — Former Two and a Half Men star Charlie Sheen has the HIV virus.

In an interview Tuesday on NBC's Today, the 50-year-old Sheen said he tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS.

But when asked by Today co-host Matt Lauer if he had transmitted the disease to others, he declared, ""Impossible. Impossible.""

He said he was diagnosed about four years ago. He said one reason for going public with his condition was to put a stop to shakedowns from prostitutes and others who threatened to out him. He said he had paid ""enough to bring it into the millions"" — perhaps as much as $10 million — to buy their silence and now was seeking to ""put a stop to this barrage of attacks and subtruths.""

He said one prostitute took a photo of the HIV-related drugs in his medicine cabinet and threatened to sell it to the tabloids.

""Are you still paying these people?"" Lauer asked him.

""Not after today I'm not,"" Sheen said.

With his public pronouncement he said he hoped to reduce the stigma still felt by some diagnosed with HIV.

""I have a responsibility now to better myself and to help a lot of other people,"" he said. ""And hopefully with what we're doing today, others may come forward and say, 'Thanks, Charlie, for kicking the door open.'""

The disclosure was only the latest chapter in Sheen's headline-seizing behavior. In recent years, drug and alcohol use led to his being kicked off CBS' Two and a Half Men in 2011 after an explosive meltdown that included calling the show's producer ""a contaminated little maggot.""

His escapades also included the revelation that he spent more than $50,000 as a client of ""Hollywood Madam"" Heidi Fleiss' prostitution ring.

Two and a Half Men debuted in 2003 and starred Sheen as womanizing bachelor Charlie Harper. It made Sheen one of TV's highest-paid actors and at its peak was TV's most-watched sitcom. It ended its run earlier this year, after Ashton Kutcher stepped in for the fired Sheen.

In 2012, Sheen returned to TV in Anger Management, an FX sitcom adapted from the movie of the same name.

Sheen has been wed three times, the first time to model Donna Peele in the 1990s.

He and actress Denise Richards were married from 2002–2006 and have two daughters. Sheen and real estate investor Brooke Mueller wed in 2008 and divorced in 2011; they have two sons. Sheen said he had informed her of his diagnosis.",17/11/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Charlie Sheen to make revealing personal announcement’ as HIV rumors swirl,"The rumor began on the Internet last month. On Monday, just as a National Enquirer report claimed that Charlie Sheen is HIV positive, NBC released a statement saying the 50-year-old actor is set to make a ""revealing personal announcement"" in a sit-down with Matt Lauer.

Could it be that Sheen’s admitted drug use and penchant for prostitutes and porn stars have brought him to peak cautionary-tale status?

To be clear: It is not confirmed what the troubled Two and a Half Men alum will speak about in the Today show studio some time between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. Tuesday. (The interview will be posted on today.com after it airs.) But on Monday, the National Enquirer claimed that the Anger Management actor was the big Tinseltown name behind the story it published last month with the headline ""Hollywood Superstar’s Desperate Battle With AIDS!""

That item fueled a frenzy of speculation, with many readers suggesting that Sheen fit the profile. The tabloid on Monday added sordid details about the alleged scandal surrounding TV’s once highest-paid actor, promising that a lengthy tell-all would hit stands on Nov. 18 following an 18-month investigation into the very private matter.

TMZ spoke with anonymous Today insiders who said that Sheen will, in fact, announce that he is HIV positive and likely will address the National Enquirer report that claims he has ""spent millions"" to hide his diagnosis for years.

Howard Bragman, a top publicist and crisis manager to the stars, told People that Sheen’s team approached him six months ago seeking advice on how best to handle the situation.

""The interview could open up a lot of sympathy for him, but he has to be concerned about a fear of litigation from former sexual partners,"" Bragman said. ""You don’t take that lightly.""

According to Bragman, Sheen ""is getting treatment, and a lot of people in his life know about it.""

That includes ex-wife Denise Richards, who has known ""for a number of years,"" according to an Access Hollywood insider. Richards and the couple’s daughters, ages 10 and 11, are not infected, since Sheen contracted the disease after their 2006 divorce. The pair have not been intimate since their split, the source revealed.

""It’s been going on for quite a while,"" Bragman said. ""He’s not necessarily comfortable talking about it. It was very hard to get up the courage for him to talk about it.""

""I’ve known about this a long time; it’s not a surprise to me,"" Bragman added. ""I feel very sorry for his pain. And I hope it’s used as a teachable moment for the world. This is a disease that can affect anyone.""

Sheen’s longtime publicist, Jeff Ballard, told People that they are no longer working together, in part because of the diagnosis.

""We had a disagreement how to handle a situation and we parted ways,"" Ballard said. ""We have had a 35-year friendship and I love him. I wish him nothing but the best.""",16/11/2015
Tampa Bay Times,"Black results matter: New program aims to boost minority participation in clinical trials at USF, Moffitt","John Harrell was out of options.

Diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2009, he had tried everything available. The seven drugs and two types of radiation didn't stop his cancer, nor did the bone marrow transplant.

""I had to take a risk,"" he said. ""None of those treatments gave me remission. The disease would always win.""

So in 2013, Harrell, 48, became one of the few African-Americans to try an experimental drug being tested in a clinical trial at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.

Those in the business of clinical trials would like to see more volunteers like Harrell, and a new local effort is trying to make that happen.

The vast majority of clinical trial volunteers — 80 to 90 percent, according to some studies — are white, adult, non-Hispanic males. Not included in that number are trials that recruit only specific groups.

The lack of diversity was frustrating for pharmacologist Kevin Sneed, dean of USF's College of Pharmacy. He knew from years of working with drugs and clinical trials that subtle molecular, cellular and genetic differences between racial and ethnic groups can influence the way each responds to treatment.

""Maybe it's the way they metabolize a medication or sodium, for example,"" Sneed said. ""If you don't have enough genetic variability in your trial, you are forced to assume that the treatment will work the same in all groups of people, and we can't do that.""

Drugs react differently in women than in men, in children than in adults, and in 30-year-olds compared to someone who's 85, he explained. ""Until you study a treatment in enough members of a particular group, you can't predict what the outcome's going to be.""

So Sneed developed a program he hopes will encourage more minority patients to volunteer for trials.

Clinical trials are the gold standard for finding out whether medications, medical procedures and devices are safe and benefit patients. At any given time, hundreds of trials are under way at medical centers and laboratories across the country. And thousands of volunteer patients are enrolled, the vast majority of them adult white males.

According to a 2011 FDA report on clinical trial participation, only 5 percent of U.S. study volunteers are African-American and 1 percent are Hispanic. In federally funded cancer research, 8 percent of participants are African-American, 5.6 percent are Hispanic and 2.8 percent are Asian/Pacific Islander, according to a 2006 National Cancer Institute study.

The problem is those numbers do not reflect the health care landscape. African-Americans and Hispanics, for example, have higher rates of diabetes, HIV/AIDS and obesity than whites, yet most of the drugs that treat those conditions have been tested primarily in Caucasian men, according to the FDA's Office of Minority Health.

Why so little minority participation?

The infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment is often cited as a barrier. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, poor black men were enrolled in a federal clinical trial without fully understanding the research or giving fully informed consent, and without being given currently available treatment.

But recent research into the long-term fallout from that study found other reasons are to blame as well, including the complexity of consent forms, language barriers, lack of transportation to and from study sites, cultural beliefs about Western medicine and minorities simply not being asked to participate.

At Moffitt, one of Lee Green's main jobs is to find ways to increase ethnic and cultural diversity in clinical trials. He admits it can be difficult, and looks forward to Sneed's new program for help.

""The time is right for a new initiative,"" said Green, who is vice president of Diversity and Community Relations at the center.

""There might be some treatment that would be more toxic in one group compared to another, and you might not find out about that difference until the drug is out in the marketplace. We want to find that out in a trial.""

The cornerstone of Sneed's program will be a group of five community members who will make up what he calls the Community Research Review Committee. They will meet with researchers, learn about each clinical trial and take the request for volunteers to minority communities — primarily through a network of religious, social and civic groups. In essence, the group will be giving its stamp of approval to the study and encouraging minorities to join.

""We are asking that at least one CRRC member has some science background so that they understand the research and the medical conditions and can explain it in layman's terms to others,"" said Sneed, who developed the program over several years with the help of an NIH grant, a team of 10 graduate students and a fellow College of Pharmacy faculty member.

He said he expects it to be available for all researchers at USF and Moffitt by early 2016.

Harrell, the lymphoma patient, said he's glad he was offered a new, experimental drug that was in development and credits it with putting his cancer into remission. He says he looks forward to the launch of Sneed's program, and is anxious to see more minorities participate in clinical trials.

""If we don't lend ourselves to these studies, we're going to miss out,"" he said. ""If a cure comes out and we find it only works for certain populations, we can't scream racism. We tried to recruit you on the front end. I feel an obligation to be on the front end of this fight.""

Green says sharing stories like Harrell's and providing education to under-represented groups about clinical trials is key to getting them involved in medical research.

""People don't realize that clinical trials extend and save lives in some cases,"" he said. ""Dr. Sneed's work will supplement what we're already doing at Moffitt to diversify clinical trials. Working together we can have a much bigger impact.""",03/11/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Lawmakers propose needle exchange program to combat HIV/AIDS,"State lawmakers hoping to reduce the number of Floridians living with HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C are for the fourth time putting their weight behind a needle exchange program in Miami-Dade County.

The program — which would allow intravenous drug users to safely discard used needles and syringes in exchange for clean ones — would begin as a pilot program run by the University of Miami. It cleared its first Senate committee on a unanimous vote Monday.

This bill (SB 242), sponsored by Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, made it to the Senate floor last year but died in the House Judiciary Committee.

Opponents say programs like this make it easier for people to use illegal drugs. But Braynon says those detractors miss the point.

""I don’t think they understand how intravenous drug use works,"" he said. ""They don’t understand that it’s a debilitating and crippling addiction. The only way we can help them is to bring them into the system.""

Braynon’s proposal would be funded entirely by private donations. No state or local money could go to the program. And it would come back to the Legislature for reevaluation in 2020.

But Braynon’s hope is that the pilot program could blossom into a statewide effort.

Needle exchange programs like this one are a popular way for states to try and curb the spread of bloodborne diseases like HIV, which affects 26,445 people in Miami-Dade alone and 101,977 people across the state, according to the Florida Department of Health. Nearly a fifth of those cases are intravenous drug users.

In Hillsborough and Pinellas counties the numbers of those living with HIV/AIDS are lower -- 6,262 and 3,675, respectively -- although they are more frequently related to drug use than in Miami-Dade County or the state on average.

Even opponents of the programs are starting to turn to them. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a staunch opponent of needle exchanges, pushed a bill through that state’s legislature last spring after tiny Scott County saw 140 HIV diagnoses tied to drug use in just a few months, prompting Pence to declare a state of emergency.",02/11/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Some words of caution about a Halloween favorite: caramel apples,"What's better at this time of year than a large, shiny caramel-covered apple? They're almost as much a part of Halloween as jack-o'-lanterns and goblins.

But, if you're planning on dipping your own apples or buying ready-made, you might want to take a few precautions to prevent a potentially serious illness.

Researchers reporting in the online journal of the American Society of Microbiology found that Granny Smith apples dipped in caramel became a breeding ground for listeria if the apples were made with sticks and stored at room temperature for several days.

Caramel apples are commonly made by inserting a wooden popsicle stick into the stem end of the apple so you can easily hold it while dipping it into warm, melted caramel. Because they can be difficult to bite into when they are chilled, many people simply store the apples at room temperature and eat them over the course of several days.

Scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Food Research Institute found inserting a stick into the apple caused juice to leak onto the surface of the fruit. That moisture became trapped under the caramel, creating what one of the lead researchers, Kathleen Glass, called a ""microenvironment on the surface of the apple that facilitates growth of any Listeria monocytogenes cells that are already present on the apple surface.""

Listeria is a type of bacteria that can cause serious illness, even death. Symptoms include fever, headache, stiff neck and gastrointestinal distress, which may not appear for three or four weeks after eating infected foods.

The University of Wisconsin study was prompted by a listeriosis outbreak in 2014 in which 35 people from 12 states were infected and seven people died. All but three of the 31 victims who became ill reported eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples.

Dianna Thomas, a registered dietitian at St. Anthony's Hospital in St. Petersburg, said most people probably aren't aware of the potential for contracting a listeriosis infection from caramel apples.

Younger, healthy adults may become infected and never know it or have just a mild case of diarrhea. But some groups are at risk for serious illness.

""Anyone whose immune system is compromised, such as those with HIV or cancer, are at high risk. So are the elderly, young children and anyone with a chronic health condition. Moms who are breastfeeding should also be careful with fresh produce and unpasteurized dairy products,"" Thomas said.

According to UW researchers, caramel apples made without sticks took longer to grow listeria when stored at room temperature. Growth of the bacteria was further delayed, by up to four weeks, when the apples were made without sticks and stored in the refrigerator.

To prevent illness, the researchers recommend using tongs to hold the apples for dipping, eating them right after they are made or inserting the stick right before eating, and storing remaining apples in the refrigerator.

Thomas adds this: ""People die from (listeria) infections every year and all those deaths are preventable with proper food handling and storage and avoiding unpasteurized dairy products, especially where people in those high-risk populations are concerned.""

Tampa Bay Times,PolitiFact: Is the South the HIV/AIDS epicenter?,"In advance of the first Democratic debate, CNN decided to ask some of the rich and famous what question they'd like to put to the candidates.

Sir Elton John said his question would be about his personal passion, the fight against HIV/AIDS.

""In spite of great progress, HIV/AIDS is actually dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South. What would you do as president to help stop this epidemic, particularly among minority communities?"" John said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, about 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and about 12.8 percent of them don't know they're infected.

HIV/AIDS didn't wind up a discussion point in the first Democratic debate. But PolitiFact decided John had a point worth checking.

We began by contacting the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York City, and it sent us, among other things, a link to a story that appeared in the Washington Post in September 2014 under the headline ""Southern states are now epicenter of HIV/AIDS in the U.S.""

The article quoted Rainey Campbell, then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, as saying Southern states have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease and the most people dying from it.

The foundation also sent a link to a report by the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) from November 2012, examining HIV epidemiology in the South using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies.

The report focused on nine states in the South that were identified as ""particularly affected by HIV"" — Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

The targeted states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States — 23.8 per 100,000 — according to the CDC data. The South, the report said, makes up a third of the country's population but is home to more than half of the new HIV diagnoses.

Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest HIV incidence rates, and seven of the 10 with the highest AIDS incidence rates, were in the targeted states, according to the report.

We decided to check in with the CDC to see if we could learn more.

Ranking regions by the rate of new HIV diagnoses, the South is highest with 24,323 new cases, or a ratio of 20.5 per 100,00 population, based on the latest data available from 2013.

Next highest is the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont), with 8,908 new HIV diagnoses, or 15.9 per 100,000 population.

The West (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) is next with 8,013 new diagnoses, or 10.8 per 100,000 population.

And last is the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) with 6,109 new diagnoses, or nine per 100,000 population, according to the CDC.

So, clearly the South has a big problem.

But we still weren't sure whether any of this proved that HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the South. Couldn't it be that other regions are doing a better job with education and treatment? Nic Carlisle, new executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition, said it's likely ""a combination of both.""

The most recent CDC surveillance report shows the country was making moderate progress until 2011, when the number of new diagnoses started moving in the wrong direction again — with only the West showing a decrease in 2012-13, Carlisle said.

The increases were 3.4 percent in the Midwest, 3.2 percent in the Northeast and a substantially greater 7.5 percent for the South in 2012-13, he said.

""True, we've have made remarkable progress in addressing the HIV epidemic in the United States. Treatment advances have transformed what was once a fatal diagnosis into a chronic disease for many,"" Carlisle said.

""Unfortunately, while the rest of the country reaps the benefits of this progress, the South is in danger of being left behind.""

Even the Obama administration recognizes the need to stem the widening HIV-related health disparities that plague the South. In its update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), the administration set a goal of reducing disparities in the rate of new diagnoses by at least 15 percent among people living in the Southern states, Carlisle said.

John's overarching point is that the South has seen an increase in AIDS/HIV, greater than any other region in the nation. The data support that.

You can quibble about whether there is enough of a trend line to term this a dramatic jump in cases. That takes his statement down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter.

We rate John's statement Mostly True.

Tampa Bay Times,"For offenders who can't pay, it's a pint of blood or jail time","MARION, Ala. — Judge Marvin Wiggins' courtroom was packed on a September morning. The docket listed hundreds of offenders who owed fines or fees for a wide variety of crimes — hunting after dark, assault, drug possession and passing bad checks among them.

""Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,"" began Wiggins, a circuit judge here in rural Alabama since 1999. ""For your consideration, there's a blood drive outside,"" he continued, according to a recording of the hearing. ""If you don't have any money, go out there and give blood and bring in a receipt indicating you gave blood.""

For those who had no money or did not want to give blood, the judge concluded: ""The sheriff has enough handcuffs.""

Efforts by courts and local governments to generate revenue by imposing fines for minor offenses, particularly from poor and working-class people, have attracted widespread attention and condemnation in recent months. But legal and health experts said they could not think of another modern example of a court all but ordering offenders to give blood in lieu of payment, or face jail time. They all agreed it was improper.

""What happened is wrong in about 3,000 ways,"" said Arthur Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, part of New York University. ""You're basically sentencing someone to an invasive procedure that doesn't benefit them and isn't protecting the public health.""

Reached by phone, Wiggins said: ""I cannot speak with you.""

The dozens of offenders who showed up that day, old and young, filed out of the Perry County Courthouse and waited their turn at a mobile blood bank parked in the street. They were told to bring a receipt to the clerk showing they had given a pint of blood, and in return they would receive a $100 credit toward their fines — and be allowed to go free.

Carl Crocker, who was among those who owed money to the court, recounted seeing one older man pass out after his blood was taken. Another witness, Traci Green, said one young man became so angry about the choice he was given that he was taken out of the courtroom.

James M. Barnes Jr., a lawyer who was in the courtroom that morning, said, ""I thought it was really unusual.

""I don't know whether it's legal or not. I don't know if that violates half the Constitution,"" he said.

On Monday, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed an ethics complaint against Wiggins, saying he had committed ""a violation of bodily integrity."" The group also objected to the hearing beyond the matter of blood collection, calling the entire proceeding unconstitutional.

Payment-due hearings like this one are part of a new initiative by Alabama's struggling courts to raise money by aggressively pursuing outstanding fines, restitution, court costs and lawyer fees. Many of those whose payments are sought in these hearings have been found at one point to be indigent, yet their financial situations often are not considered when they are summoned for outstanding payments.

Several people who were present at the hearing Sept. 17 said they were unsure whether they were being ordered to pay the entire amount due or their usual monthly payment, which many had been paying on time, often for offenses dating back a decade or more.

Green, 43, who owes thousands of dollars, related to two marijuana-related convictions — one from 1998 — said he offered to pay as much as he could but was led to believe he had to give blood anyway.

""He told us we got to go there and give some blood or we go to jail,"" Green said. He said that he had willingly given blood before, but like others there on that day, did not want to be compelled to do so.

Ordering defendants to give blood used to be more commonplace, particularly during wartime, according to ""Flesh and Blood,"" a history of blood transfusion and organ transplantation by Susan Lederer, a professor of medical history at Yale University.

In the mid 20th century, judges in several places around the country, including Honolulu after the Pearl Harbor attack, ordered people convicted of traffic violations to give blood or offered blood donations as an alternative to a fine. More commonly, prisoners would receive cash incentives or reduced sentences for giving blood. (As late as 2008, a judge in Broward County offered traffic offenders the choice of a fine, community service or a blood donation.)

But fears about the spread of hepatitis led to a broad move away from compensation for blood in the 1970s and to what has become a nearly all-volunteer blood donation system. While it is not illegal to pay someone for blood, the Food and Drug Administration does require that blood collected in exchange for compensation be labeled ""paid,"" and hospitals generally refuse such blood for transfusions.

Crocker, 41, who made the recordings of Wiggins, also recorded the employees of the mobile blood bank, who seemed fully aware of the sentence-reduction arrangement. Crocker said he grew even more uncomfortable later, after he recognized the blood bank, LifeSouth Community Blood Centers, which had recently lost a $4 million judgment for an HIV-tainted blood transfusion.

""It's just wrong for them to utilize people who are in the court system and essentially extort blood out of you because you owe traffic tickets, misdemeanors, felonies, whatever you're there for,"" Crocker said.

Jill Evans, a vice president for LifeSouth, which is based in Gainesville, said the employee who set up the blood drive with the courthouse had acted improperly because the employee understood ahead of time that the judge would reduce community service obligations for those willing to donate, a violation of company policy.

""We appreciate the judge's attempt to support the community's blood needs,"" Evans said. ""However, LifeSouth prohibits blood donations from being considered as community service because it is potentially an unacceptable incentive for a volunteer donor.""

Evans said that after receiving a complaint, LifeSouth quarantined and tested the blood, tried to contact all the donors and eventually discarded nearly all of the blood units collected.

The record at the county jail shows that no one was taken into custody that day. The court clerk said in a brief interview that there had been no intention of jailing anyone; Crocker said this was because everyone decided that having blood taken was better than going to jail.

However, Sara Zampierin, a lawyer at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said that in the handful of instances she reviewed of people who gave blood, none had received the $100 discount they had been promised.",20/10/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Doctors concerned about screening for state health program for disabled children,"Doctors continue to raise concerns about the state’s plan to replace a tool for screening sick and disabled children in and out of a health care program.

Since May, the Department of Health has used a new tool to decide which kids are eligible for Children’s Medical Services — that was until a judge threw out the process in September. On Friday, the department held a workshop to replace that tool, which the judge ordered wasn’t legal because it hadn’t gone through official rule-making processes.

Meantime, more than 10,000 children have been removed from the program since May, fueling allegations that the state is intentionally trying to cut down the size of the program.

That’s what has doctors frustrated: They worry that kids who need health coverage to treat serious conditions might not be accepted into the program in the short term before a new tool can be adopted as early as the end of the year, and they also fear that once this tool is put into place, it might not fix the problems they saw in the one from May.

""It’s basically a redo of version 12 (from May),"" said Dr. Louis St. Petery, a Tallahassee pediatric cardiologist. ""The medical professionals who work with the child, it eliminates their ability to evaluate.""

That’s because the proposed tool — like the most recent one — would rely heavily on parents’ responses to questions about their children’s condition and its severity. It would take into account a set of diagnoses from doctors, as well, but that list is not exhaustive.

Doctors, including Dr. John Curran, associate vice president of USF Health, told health department officials Friday that most parents don’t know what is normal and what is abnormal in a child and so their impressions aren’t very useful in consistently deciding what conditions are severe.

""It’s tough to raise a family when everything goes right and nothing goes wrong,"" said Curran, who’s also a regional medical director for CMS.

Some doctors said the proposed new tool is an improvement, though, because it would allow doctors to put certain patients into the program if they have a particular diagnosis, such as chronic kidney disease, spina bifida or HIV.

The department, however, says it cannot use a comprehensive list of diagnoses as the only way to screen patients, and they cannot leave it entirely up to doctors.

""What we would hate to do is create a situation that is far too liberal and cannot be changed easily,"" Jennifer Tschetter, chief operating officer of the health department, said.

From here, the health department will take comments from doctors who want to have input on the tool moving forward. By the end of the year, the tool should be in place, Tschetter said.",16/10/2015
Tampa Bay Times,The chains of mental illness in West Africa,"KPOVÉ, Togo — The church grounds here sprawled through a strange, dreamlike forest. More than 150 men and women were chained by the ankle to a tree or concrete block, a short walk from the central place of worship. Most were experiencing the fearsome delusions of schizophrenia. On a recent visit, some glared while others slept or muttered to themselves. A few pushed to their feet and gestured wildly, their cries piercing the stillness.

Until this year, Koffi Gbedjeha, 45, a carpenter and father of four, was one of them — a resident of the Jesus Is the Solution prayer camp here, shackled like the others, his family and camp staff members said. For more than two years, his youngest sister, Akossiwa, 27, tended to him. Rising early each morning, she walked along a cool path to the human forest; each day, amid the stirring bodies and clinking chains, she emptied her brother's chamber pot, swept the ground and cooked his meals over a charcoal fire.

""Don't you pray for me,"" Koffi Gbedjeha (pronounced guh-BED-zhe-ha) sometimes shouted at camp workers who asked God to cast out the dark spirits they believed were making him sick. ""I should be praying for you.""

Every society struggles to care for people with mental illness. In parts of West Africa, where psychiatry is virtually unknown, the chain is often a last resort for desperate families who cannot control a loved one in the grip of psychosis. Religious retreats, known as prayer camps, set up makeshift psychiatric wards, usually with prayer as the only intervention. Nine camps visited recently in Togo ranged from small, family operations to this one, Jesus Is the Solution, by far the largest and most elaborate.

""We try to talk people out of going to the camps,"" said Dr. Simliwa Kolou Valentin Dassa, Togo's director of mental health services, ""but we cannot tell them to stop if there's no alternative.""

Historically, mental illness has lingered near the bottom of both African and global health priorities, well behind deadly threats like malaria, measles and HIV. But last month, the United Nations adopted global development goals that, for the first time, include a commitment to ""promote mental health and well-being"" and to reduce premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases, including mental disorders, by one-third by 2030. The World Health Organization has also intensified its focus on mental health, calling for an end to the chaining of people with mental illnesses.

The U.N. pledge, though little more than a promise of change, is the culmination of years of efforts by doctors, field workers and advocates across the developing world. According to the WHO, most countries in Africa, if they have a dedicated budget for mental health care at all, devote an average of less than 1 percent of their health spending to the problem, compared with 6 to 12 percent in the wealthy countries of the West. At last count, Liberia had just one practicing psychiatrist. Niger had three, Togo four and Benin seven. Sierra Leone had none.

For now in Africa, it is the families of people with mental illnesses who bear the overwhelming costs of care, and the greatest burden falls on mothers, sisters and daughters.

""I wondered if he would ever get better,"" said Akossiwa Gbedjeha, who put everything else on hold to care for her brother: sleeping on the ground along with other families, passing endless afternoons alone, reading the Bible and praying, feeling an encroaching despair with each passing month. ""I wanted to return to my life.""

Then, one morning in January, she walked to the forest of shackled people and found only her brother's broken chain. She looked for him, frantically, but there was no trace. The camp quickly assembled a search party.

Koffi Gbedjeha was on the run.

Differing camps

The camps in Togo vary widely in character. They include Jesus Is the Solution, a large operation, as well as bare-bones, family outfits like Sitsopé, which means ""place of refuge,"" and Rama, both on the outskirts of the capital, Lomé. The camps often reflect the personality of the head pastor and tend to have a sleepy, sun-drained rhythm, with the day's quiet occasionally punctuated by an outburst from someone in chains.

In neighboring Ghana, Human Rights Watch visited eight prayer camps with roots in Pentecostal or evangelical denominations that held close to 200 people. Nearly all the residents were chained by their ankles to trees in open compounds, where they slept, urinated and defecated and bathed, the group reported in 2012. None of the camps employed a ""qualified medical or psychiatric practitioner.""

Chaining people against their will violates the United Nations' disability rights convention, which most West African countries, including Togo, Ghana and Nigeria, have ratified. But religious feeling is strong in this part of the world, and the pastors who run the camps preach that, through them, God can heal almost any ailment, especially ones thought to be essentially spiritual, like psychosis.

At Jesus Is the Solution, Paul Noumonvi, a charismatic pastor, has built a retreat that includes an open-air church the size of an airplane hangar, a cafeteria, cabins, an outdoor ""ward"" for residents with mental illnesses and, down the road, a walled-off compound that encloses his spacious house.

Noumonvi said that praying for people with mental problems was a service he offered. Each family is required to provide food, cleanup and a chain, but he does not ask for payment, he said, adding that the camp currently holds 175 people.

""Many of these people already have tried other things, like traditional healers, herbs and drugs, but the problem didn't go away,"" he said. ""As for healing, we believe a spell has been cast on them. It can be witchcraft; this is the cause of the illness. When a person is reasonable again, acting normally, rationally, we say, okay, this person is healed.'""

A frightened family

Koffi Gbedjeha, the eldest of five, was his family's rock. When his younger brother Komlan quit trade school, Koffi persuaded Komlan to persist and to become a motorbike mechanic. When an aunt was using Koffi's sisters as housekeepers, he made sure they were sent back home to the family village.

""He was so important to us because he fought for us all the time,"" his sister Akossiwa said. So his siblings were deeply shaken when Koffi began having serious mental problems in his early 30s — problems that he denied. He would denounce strangers on the street as sorcerers or demons, they said, and then have conversations with figures invisible to everyone but him. ""I wanted him to go to the hospital because something was very wrong,"" Komlan said.

One night in December 2012, when Koffi was at a sister's home, acting bizarrely, she dissolved a strong sedative into his soup, and he fell into a deep sleep. Komlan and two friends tied him up.

At Jesus Is the Solution, the camp secretary registered Gbedjeha as a patient and told Komlan the family would be responsible for his care and feeding. The siblings begged the youngest, Akossiwa, to mind her brother; she reluctantly agreed.

Then came the night in January when he broke free.

After weeks on the run, he arrived at his home village, and he was welcomed back. But soon, Koffi moved back to Lomé, and the aggression and the demons returned.

This time, Komlan was determined to get his brother to a medical facility, and the elders agreed.

In March, Komlan contrived for a mutual friend to lure Koffi into his car with the promise of a job. The two overpowered and bound Koffi and took him to St. John the Divine, a small Roman Catholic mental health clinic near the capital.

The clinic's director, Brother Emmanuel Agbedzinou, a psychiatric nurse, injected Koffi with an antipsychotic drug combined with a sedative. After a week of daily drug treatment, Koffi grew calmer, but by then, his family had run out of money. In April, he moved back to Lomé. But Koffi had a difficult time in Lomé and is now back in his home village, working with his uncle, selling water from a well. He has stabilized on antipsychotic medication and hopes one day to set up a carpentry workshop — as long as his family can afford the drugs, which it has struggled to do.

It is good to have him back, Komlan said, but ""no one knows what is coming next.""",13/10/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Working for 'the most hated man in America',"He's been called the most hated man in America, harangued by presidential candidates, spoofed by Saturday Night Live and called out by members of Congress demanding details about his pharmaceutical company's business practices.

It's no fun being Martin Shkreli.

It's no picnic working for him either, as those who are managing Turing Pharmaceuticals' public perception crisis in Washington and beyond can attest.

""If you could see the emails and phone calls I got, being associated with Turing — they're vicious, hateful, in bucketfuls,"" said Allan Ripp, a spokesman for Turing since the company's launch in February. "" 'You scumbag, pig.' You can't help but have an existential crisis and ask, 'Am I doing the right thing?' ""

Shkreli, Turing's chief executive, became public enemy No. 1 last month after his company raised the price of the drug Daraprim, which is used to treat parasitic infections in patients who suffer from diseases such as AIDS/HIV and cancer, from $13.50 a tablet to $750 — a decision he later rescinded, though he did not specify a new price.

He quickly became the face of corporate greed and his initial tone deaf response threw more gasoline on his public relations bonfire.

The job of cleaning up the mess is now in the hands of Shkreli's communications staff and his Washington operatives.

Ripp, who runs a public relations firm in New York representing corporations and law firms, says he is confident in his decision to work with Shkreli and his company. The same cannot be said of Craig Rothenberg, Turing's chief communication officer and a longtime Johnson & Johnson executive, who stepped down shortly after the controversy over Daraprim erupted.

Ripp said Turing has been misunderstood and vilified — understandably so, he concedes, given how swiftly the news snowballed on the Internet and social media — but that Turing's leaders are committed to developing life-saving drugs, investing in research to improve their formulation and treating a wider population of patients.

Daraprim is the only FDA-approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, an infection that can be life-threatening for people with weakened immune systems such as AIDS and cancer patients. Turing acquired Daraprim in August for $55 million. Shkreli initially defended the decision to hike the price of the drug, saying the profits could be reinvested into research to develop new treatments, but later reversed course.

Turing is not the first or only pharmaceutical company to face scrutiny for raising the price of drugs. Lawmakers are also pressing Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to issue a subpoena to Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which this year spiked the price of medications treating heart conditions.

Still, the anger directed at Shkreli sets him apart.

""There's now a built-in assumption that you have a wifebeater. … This company had zero reputation, zero track record,"" Ripp said, noting Turing was not well known until the recent controversy. ""You can't regain control of your image, you can ask for patience and distance to show this company intends to do the right thing in the way it develops drugs. That's going to take some time.""

And with members of Congress and presidential candidates now showing an interest in Turing, the company has enlisted the aid of Washington lobbyists.

It has hired four lobbyists at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a Pittsburgh-based law firm with about 50 attorneys and lobbyists in Washington, in part to deal with inquiries from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who have asked the company to provide details about its finances and price-setting practices

Ingersoll & Rooney has team of veteran health care lobbyists well versed in drug pricing issues.

A spokeswoman for Buchanan Ingersoll referred questions about Turing to Ripp.

""The company feels it's in extremely good hands and experienced hands, and is comfortable it made the right choice and has the right partner,"" Ripp said of the lobbyists.",08/10/2015
Tampa Bay Times,A drug's price goes up — from $13.50 to $750,"A 62-year-old drug called Daraprim is the standard of care for treating a life-threatening illness in babies born to women who become infected by a parasite during pregnancy. It also is used for those with compromised immune systems, like AIDS patients and certain cancer patients.

Last month, Daraprim was acquired by Turing Pharmaceuticals, a startup run by a former hedge fund manager. Turing immediately raised the price to $750 a tablet from $13.50, bringing the annual cost of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

""What is it that they are doing differently that has led to this dramatic increase?"" said Dr. Judith Aberg, the chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

The price increase is not an isolated example. Although most of the attention on pharmaceutical prices has been on new drugs for diseases like cancer and high cholesterol, there is also growing concern about huge increases for older drugs that have long been mainstays of treatment.

Some of the price increases have resulted from a business strategy of buying old, neglected drugs and turning them into high-priced ""specialty drugs.""

Cycloserine, a drug used to treat some tuberculosis cases, was just increased in price to $10,800 for 30 pills from $500 after its acquisition by Rodelis Therapeutics. Scott Spencer, general manager of Rodelis, said the company needed to invest to make sure the supply of the drug remained reliable. He said the company provided the drug free to certain needy patients.

In August, two members of Congress investigating generic drug price increases wrote to Valeant Pharmaceuticals after that company acquired two heart drugs, Isuprel and Nitropress, from Marathon Pharmaceuticals and promptly raised their prices by 525 percent and 212 percent, respectively. Marathon itself had acquired the drugs from another company in 2013 and had quintupled their prices, according to the lawmakers, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. Another drug, Doxycycline, an antibiotic, went from $20 a bottle in October 2013 to $1,849 by April 2014.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association sent a joint letter to Turing earlier this month calling the price increase on Daraprim ""unjustifiable for the medically vulnerable patient population"" and ""unsustainable for the health care system.""

Martin Shkreli, the chief executive of Turing, said the drug is so rarely used that the impact on the health system would be minuscule and that Turing would use the money it earns to develop better drugs.

""This isn't the greedy drug company trying to gouge patients. It is us trying to stay in business,"" Shkreli said.

This is not the first time the 32-year-old Shkreli has been the center of controversy. He started MSMB Capital, a hedge fund company, in his 20s and drew attention for urging the Food and Drug Administration not to approve certain drugs made by companies whose stock he was shorting.

Daraprim, which is also used to treat malaria, has long been made by GlaxoSmithKline. Glaxo sold U.S. marketing rights in 2010 to CorePharma. Last year, Impax Laboratories agreed to buy Core for $700 million. In August, Impax sold Daraprim to Turing for $55 million.

Daraprim cost only about $1 per tablet several years ago, but it went up sharply after CorePharma acquired it. According to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions, sales of the drug jumped to $6.3 million in 2011 from $667,000 in 2010. In 2014, after further price increases, sales were $9.9 million. Turing's price increase could bring sales to tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

Other companies could conceivably make generic copies of Daraprim, because patents have long expired. One factor that could discourage that option is that Daraprim's distribution is now tightly controlled, making it harder for generic companies to get the samples they need for testing.

""This seems to be all profit driven for somebody,"" said Aberg of Mount Sinai, ""and I just think it's a very dangerous process.""",21/09/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Study of Americans' safe sex practices ranks Florida among the worst,"A new study sponsored by Trojan condoms has found that Floridians are pretty bad at sex — the safe kind, that is.

According to the State by State Safer Sex Index, Florida ranks 47th in the nation for its high rates of sexually transmitted diseases and lack of contraception education.

Actually, much of the southeast United States ranks lowest on the study's list.

50. Louisiana

49. Georgia

48. Mississippi

47. Florida

46. Texas

45. Tennessee

44. Arkansas

43. Nevada

42. Alaska

41. Alabama

The study ( tbtim.es/ond), sponsored by Trojan and conducted by Variance, LLC, a research firm that promotes sexual health, measured eight different factors related to STDs and contraception to determine the ranking. It included factors such as the frequency of gonorrhea and syphilis cases, the rate of HIV diagnoses and those tested for the virus. The study also took into account rate of teen pregnancy, the percentage of high schools that teach condom use and whether or not the state mandates that sex education classes must discuss contraception.

Florida does not mandate contraception education, according to the study, and less than half of Florida high schools — 38.6 percent — talk about condoms.

In comparison, Vermont, which ranked first in the Trojan study, mandates all sex and STD/HIV education classes cover contraception, and 85.4 percent of the state's high schools teach the benefits of using condoms.

Many of the states in the study's top 10 sexually safest states boasted similar statistics and were concentrated in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest.

3. New Hampshire

4. Hawaii

5. New Jersey

6. Rhode Island

7. West Virginia

8. Washington

9. Idaho

Tampa Bay Times,Drug execs behind female libido pill have run afoul of FDA,"WASHINGTON — A small drugmaker from North Carolina may succeed next week where many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies have failed: in winning approval for the first drug to boost women's sexual desire.

The husband-and-wife team that founded Sprout Pharmaceuticals is not new to the pharmaceutical business or even to marketing drugs to people frustrated with their sex lives. The couple's previous company, Slate Pharmaceuticals, sold an implantable testosterone pellet to men with low levels of the hormone.

But Slate's marketing push ran afoul of federal rules, making misleading, unsupported statements about the benefits of testosterone therapy while downplaying risks. In fact, when the Food and Drug Administration held a meeting examining the overprescribing of testosterone last year, it played Slate's commercial as an example of inappropriate marketing.

That record worries Sprout's critics, who see a troubling pattern in the aggressive tactics it has used to urge the FDA to approve the women's desire drug, which was previously rejected twice because of lackluster effectiveness and side effects such as nausea, dizziness and fainting.

The search for a pill to increase women's libido has been something of a holy grail for the pharmaceutical industry since the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the late 1990s. Pfizer, Bayer and Procter & Gamble all studied — then abandoned — potential treatments for female sexual desire disorder.

""This company already has a history of unethical marketing,"" said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman of Georgetown University. ""If approved, I think this drug will be widely prescribed, and we would see an epidemic of adverse effects.""

After a year of lobbying by Sprout-backed supporters, the drug won a surprising 18-6 recommendation from a panel of FDA advisers in June. The FDA is scheduled to make its decision on the drug by Tuesday.

CEO Cindy Whitehead and her husband, Bob Whitehead, who preceded her as CEO, paid for the drug, dubbed Addyi, by selling off their testosterone business.

There is little financial information available about Slate or Sprout because they have both been privately held.

In March 2010, the FDA sent Slate an 11-page warning letter, highlighting a host of misleading, unsupported and inaccurate statements in its brochures, websites and a video.

Among the many problems, the company's website suggested Testopel could benefit patients with depression, diabetes and HIV.",17/08/2015
Tampa Bay Times,India Clarke's friends even more determined to help transgender people,"TAMPA — Charles Thomas and Mimi Redd knew that many of their LGBT friends were at-risk. They were the young African-Americans without supportive families, the sex workers on Nebraska Avenue. They were the ones who weren't getting the help and support they needed from social service programs.

""It doesn't reach us,"" Thomas said. ""It doesn't go where we go.""

So, last summer, they started Special for You and Me Inc., a group to help lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender African-Americans.

India Clarke, a transgender woman, was one of the first to join.

She was a longtime friend of Thomas and Redd and joined their Wednesday night social group for transgender people. Special for You and Me also passed out condoms and information about HIV and STDs at nightclubs. And they offered condoms, toiletries, food and shelter to sex workers — and help if they wanted to get out of that work.

Clarke was one of the people they wanted to help. Her friends said she was outspoken about her day-to-day challenges, trying to find a job, the discrimination she faced as a transgender woman — obstacles that she thought made sex work her only option.

""She actually started to get it,"" said Ki'ala Emmons, a nightclub performer who works with Special for You and Me's transgender group. ""She wanted to go to school. She wanted to leave the street life.""

Clarke, 25, was found dead in a Tampa park July 21, shot in the head. Authorities arrested a suspect in her murder but have not revealed a motive for the crime.

However, her death — and the fact that authorities and the media identified the transgender woman using her male birth name — drew national attention and criticism.

Now, her friends are more determined than ever to help those like Clarke.

• • •

Transgender women turn to sex work because they don't have access to job opportunities or social services, said Aryah Lester, a board member of the advocacy group TransAction Florida. That, in turn, leaves them vulnerable to violence and further discrimination.

""People take these risks in order to survive,"" she said.

Thomas said many of his transgender friends have found themselves in those kinds of situations.

""Sometimes, life forces us out there,"" Thomas, 27, said. ""Now, you're out on the streets, and then you see this girl getting her hair and nails done, and she's out on Nebraska being a prostitute, and you feel like that's the only way.""

Emmons, 29, said that's why it's important to support transgender women and show them there are other ways to make a living. She was involved with transgender advocacy groups in Orlando before she moved to Tampa three years ago.

""What we want to show is equality,"" Emmons said. ""You can go to a job. You can go to a school. There are different alternatives. You don't have to make money illegally. You don't have to put yourself in danger. … You can live a regular lifestyle.""

Redd, 26, said the idea for Special for You and Me started with a gay pride event in Detroit in June, where they learned about programs that connect poor and at-risk transgender people with counseling and hormone treatment.

They wanted to bring that kind of effort to Tampa. They wanted to provide a place where transgender people can talk to each other and share information. It also would be a safe space for LGBT people who need one.

""It's best that people say their opinions and hear other people's opinions,"" Thomas said. ""People may think it's wrong to think this way, but if other people think this way, then maybe there's nothing wrong with us.""

The organizers said they've filed paperwork to register Special for You and Me as a tax-exempt nonprofit under federal tax law, but so far, the group does not appear in official records. They recently launched a website: specialforyouandme.org. They've also handed out condoms and fact sheets that they got from the Hillsborough County Health Department.

Tampa Bay's minority AIDS coordinator, Andrew Maldonado, said small groups like Special for You and Me are a crucial link between the department and the communities they want to reach.

""We're not covering as much as we should,"" Maldonado said. ""It falls on these small agencies and groups. We tell them, 'There's a lot of work to be done, are you down to do this?'""

Special for You and Me spends several nights a week at clubs and on the streets. Thomas and Redd said their outreach efforts bring mixed reactions. Some people don't want to talk about HIV in a group setting. Others do. Some of the sex workers along Nebraska Avenue bristle when they're offered help. Others are thankful.

In the coming months, they want to work out a more consistent outreach schedule and, maybe one day, try to establish a halfway house for sex workers.

""The more effort we put in, the more that other trans women will see that we care — just to get them in society,"" Redd said, ""to let them know that they can get in society; they can do other things.

""They don't have to just come out at night.""

Tampa Bay Times,"Music Planner: Elvis Costello and Steely Dan, Rachel Platten of 'Fight Song,' Jill Scott","GET THERE EARLY: Fight Song much?

If you're going to Colbie Caillat, left, at the Capitol Theatre on Sunday, do not, under any circumstances, arrive late. You might miss one of the biggest songs of 2015.

That would be Fight Song, the empowering summer anthem by singer-songwriter Rachel Platten. Platten was booked as Caillat's opener long before Fight Song took off, but in spite of how huge it has gotten, she doesn't think it's all that weird.

""Six months ago, nothing was going on,"" she said by phone from a tour stop in Sioux City, Iowa. ""Maybe in the deep, dark place where I was allowing myself to dream big, yeah, I was like, 'All right, maybe this song is special.' But not this big. This is so amazing and crazy and feels like a dream come true.""

Platten, 34, has been kicking around the singer-songwriter circuit for more than a decade, playing tiny clubs, opening for bigger artists and surviving as one of those singers whose infectious pop songs always score TV shows like Pretty Little Liars and Jane By Design.

But Fight Song, released in February, struck an immediate chord — not only with mainstream audiences, but with a certain famous fan named Taylor Swift, who professed her love for the inspirational hit, and in June invited Platten to sing it in front of 50,000 fans in Philadelphia.

""I really want more than anything for more and more people to share this song because the stories I'm getting back are just so incredible, about what the song has helped people overcome,"" Platten said. ""That was most exciting to me because that was going to be 50,000 more people that might not have had a chance to hear that song and let it resonate and help them in some way.""

ROCK OUT WITH YOUR DOCTORATE: Brainy Bands

Steely Dan and Elvis Costello are ideal tourmates. Sure, their styles complement one another — hyperliterate New Wave punk for Elvis; knotty, pristinely produced rock fusion from the Dan. But the real kicker is this: Costello, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker all seem like they'd be the brainiest cats in every room they enter. Is their summer tour, which hits the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre at 7 p.m. Tuesday ($30 and up at livenation.com), the smartest musical pairing ever? Possibly. But here are some other brainiac bands we'd like to see hit the road together.

Queen and Boston

Talk about guitar geniuses. Brian May studied astrophysics before Queen hit it big in the '70s, picked up his doctorate a decade ago and this summer collaborated with NASA on a high-profile Pluto flyby. Tom Scholz, the architect of the Boston sound, has a master's in mechanical engineering from MIT. Put these two together for a summer, and we might solve time travel.

The Offspring, the Descendents and Bad Religion

Three of the planet's smartest singers all hail from the SoCal punk scene. Who knew? The Offspring's Dexter Holland holds an advanced degree in molecular biology; his research on HIV has been published. The Descendents' Milo Aukerman holds a doctorate in biochemistry and does research for DuPont. But Bad Religion's Greg Graffin may trump them both with his Ph.D. in zoology from Cornell and several published papers. Those are some rad CVs, brah.

Devo and Thomas Dolby

Devo has always been loaded with smart guys, particularly singer Mark Mothersbaugh, a lauded Hollywood composer and visual artist. Thomas Dolby, of She Blinded Me With Science fame, is an innovator in music and technology and for years served as the musical director of the TED Talks lecture conference series. It seems like this tour should have happened back in the '80s, but we say it's never too late. Let the nerds have their day!

WOMAN'S WORLD: Outspoken Scott

Jill Scott always has something to say. In making the rounds to promote her new album Woman, she has opined in interviews and on social media on Bill Cosby (""I stood by a man I respected and loved. I was wrong. It hurts!""), Sandra Bland (""I'm disturbed on a cellular level"") and her process for understanding the human condition (""I'm a voyeur. I watch people.""). Our advice: Skip the interviews, mute her Twitter and just press play to Woman, her first LP in four years and a deeply evocative meditation on love and femininity. Fans of Scott's forward-thinking blend of slinky R&B and jazz will not be disappointed, but Woman also is peppered with bits of high-octane Philly soul, like Coming to You and Run Run Run. Scott is an irrepressible live performer — not for nothing did she headline last fall's Funk Fest at Raymond James Stadium — so expect an incandescent show at the Mahaffey Theater, 400 First St. S in St. Petersburg, at 7 p.m. Sunday. BJ the Chicago Kid opens the show (and considering they duet on Woman's closing track, Beautiful Love, he might pop up during Scott's set, too). $70.50 and up. themahaffey.com.

Tampa Bay Times,Charges dropped for man accused of growing 'medically necessary' marijuana,"Matthew Young won't be spending any time in jail for growing medical marijuana, but he says each day continues to be a battle without the drug.

The State Attorney's Office has dropped all criminal charges against the New Port Richey man arrested last year along with his girlfriend for growing marijuana to treat a slew of illnesses, including posttraumatic stress disorder.

""That we're not going to be spending time in jail, it's huge,"" Young's girlfriend, Lynne Nesselroad said. ""It's a big relief for everyone.

During his 1,600 days as a military contractor in Iraq, Young said he experienced numerous concussions from explosions, leaving him with brain injury, broken bones and PTSD. He also contracted HIV while working as a field medic and was diagnosed with AIDS about six years later, his attorney Shawn Gearhart said.

Young said he tried several medications to treat his nausea, bone pain and other symptoms, but none worked. He turned to medical marijuana, paying a Jacksonville lawyer nearly $800 to help him get a doctor to sign paperwork authorizing his right to grow and use cannabis. The drug immediately helped, he said.

""It calms everything,"" Young, 45, said. ""Without cannabis my head is like a tornado and a hurricane all at the same time.""

Young and Nesselroad were arrested in November 2014 when Pasco County sheriff's deputies found the cannabis plants growing in their home. They showed officials what they thought was certification that allowed them to grow pot for Young's medical use, but they faced criminal charges anyway.

The certification was provided by lawyer Ian Christensen, founder of Jacksonville-based Health Law Services, part of the IJC Law Group. The company tells its clients that patients with serious medical conditions have the right to use medical marijuana in Florida as long as a physician deems it ""medically necessary"" and orders its use. The company charges each client $799 for a doctor-approved identification card authorizing their use of the drug.

Bruce Bartlett, chief assistant state attorney for the Sixth Judicial Circuit, said Christensen is drawing legal conclusions from specific wording in a court opinion upholding a medical-necessity defense. This defense is not recognized in all judicial districts, Bartlett said, and cannot protect people from being arrested.

""It's not legal in the state of Florida,"" Bartlett said. ""There are no exceptions.""

The Florida Bar confirmed that a grievance committee is currently reviewing an open complaint against Christensen concerning Young.

When Young and Nesselroad were arrested, Christensen offered to represent them in court, charging them $8,000.

In late March, a judge disqualified Christensen from representing the couple because of a direct conflict with the case.

""There's no way in the world that you can represent the defendant in this case,"" Circuit Court Judge Mary Handsel said. ""He relied on your advice to grow the marijuana. That in, itself, can be a defense.""

Then, on July 17, Bartlett dropped all charges against the couple. They were both cooperating witnesses in an ongoing investigation, Bartlett wrote.

""It was apparent to us that, but for this lawyer's advice, they wouldn't have been in that position at all,"" Bartlett said later. ""These people have been punished enough.""

In a hearing on Tuesday, Handsel ordered Christensen to begin repaying the $8,000 he charged the couple to represent them in court.

Christensen would not discuss Young's case, but told the Tampa Bay Times that his company continues to offer clients ID cards that he argues defends their right to use marijuana.

""I've altered ways I do things now because of this case,"" Christensen said.

His clients now sign a disclaimer clarifying that the authorization does not provide immunity against criminal charges. It's simply a doctor-signed notice to law enforcement.

Tampa Bay Times,President Obama pushes African nations to treat gays equally under law,"NAIROBI, Kenya — President Barack Obama nudged African nations Saturday to treat gays and lesbians equally under the law, a position that remains unpopular through much of the continent. Obama's Kenyan counterpart responded by calling the matter a ""non-issue"" for his country.

Obama tackled the sensitive matter on his first full day in Kenya, the country of his father's birth. He drew on his own background as an African-American, noting the slavery and segregation of the U.S. past and saying he is ""painfully aware of the history when people are treated differently under the law.""

""That's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen,"" Obama added during a joint news conference with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. ""When a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread.""

Kenyatta was unmoved, saying gay rights ""is not really an issue on the foremost mind of Kenyans. And that is a fact.""

A number of Kenyan politicians and religious leaders had warned Obama in outspoken terms that any overtures on gay rights would not be welcomed in Kenya, where gay sex is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The Kenyan gay community also complains of sometimes violent harassment.

Obama's visit to Kenya — the first by a sitting U.S. president — has been long sought by this East African country where he is widely considered a son of the nation.

Acknowledging that some Kenyans have been frustrated that it took him until the seventh year of his presidency to visit, Obama joked that he didn't want the rest of Africa to think he was ""playing favorites."" He will also visit Ethiopia on this trip.

Still, he noted the U.S. had concerns about violence that erupted in Kenya after its 2007 election. Kenyatta faced charges related to that violence in the International Criminal Court, though those charges were later dropped. Deputy President William Ruto, however, still faces charges at the ICC.

Obama said he was encouraged by statements Kenyatta has made about the need to root out corruption in the country, saying that's one issue that could slow down Kenya's economic growth and development.

Much of Obama's discussions with Kenyatta centered on counterterrorism cooperation. Kenya has been grappling with deadly attacks from extremists, most notably Somalia-based al-Shabab, a network linked to al-Qaida.

Al-Shabab has conducted major attacks in Kenya, including the 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall and an April attack in Garissa that killed nearly 150 people.

""This is an existential fight for us,"" Kenyatta said.

The two leaders opened their day-long meetings with a joint appearance at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, a U.S.-sponsored business conference. Obama announced $1 billion in commitments from the U.S. government, as well as American banks, foundations and philanthropists.

""Africa is on the move,"" Obama declared.

Obama's election in 2008 was cheered in Africa, not just because of his family ties, but also because there was an expectation that he would devote significant attention to the continent. Those high hopes have been met with some disappointment, given that Obama's foreign policy has instead focused heavily on boosting ties with Asia and dealing with conflict in the Middle East.

The White House rejects that criticism, noting that Obama is making his fourth trip to Africa, more than any previous president. Officials are particularly sensitive to criticism that Obama's Africa policies pale in comparison to his predecessor, George W. Bush, who launched a multi-billion dollar HIV/AIDS initiative.

On Saturday, Obama said many of his African initiatives, including a program to vastly increase access to power, were intended to be years-long efforts. And he credited Bush's health programs with saving millions of lives.

""This isn't a beauty contest between presidents,"" he said.

In addition to his official agenda, Obama's visit to Kenya has been a reunion of sorts with his late father's family. Shortly after arriving in Nairobi Friday night, Obama held a private dinner with three dozen family members, including his half-sister Auma Obama and step-grandmother Sarah Obama.

""The people of Kenya will be familiar with the need to manage family politics sometimes,"" he said. ""There are cousins and uncles and aunties that show up that you didn't know existed.""

The president has written emotionally about his first visit to Kenya nearly 30 years ago, a trip aimed at learning about the father he barely knew. Obama's father traveled to the U.S. as a student, but left when his son was 2 years old. They would only see each other once more before the elder Obama died in a car crash in 1982.

Unlike on his original trip as a private citizen, security and logistical constraints prevented Obama from traveling to Kogelo, the rural village where his father lived and is buried. The president begged for forgiveness from his family and promised he would be back.

""The next time I'm back, I may not be wearing a suit,"" he added.",25/07/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Doctors say teen's HIV in check for 12 years without drugs,"An 18-year-old French teen born with the AIDS virus has had her infection under control and nearly undetectable despite stopping treatment 12 years ago — an unprecedented remission, doctors are reporting.

The teen might have some form of natural resistance to HIV that hasn't yet been discovered. But her case revives hope that early, aggressive treatment can limit how strongly the virus takes hold, and perhaps in rare cases, let people control it without lifelong drugs.

A few years ago, doctors reported a similar case: a Mississippi girl who kept HIV in check for 27 months without treatment. But then her virus rebounded, dashing hopes that early treatment might have cured her.

At least a dozen adults have had remissions for a median of 10 years after stopping HIV medicines, but the new French case is said to be the first long-lasting one that started in childhood.

The case was described Monday at an International AIDS Society conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, by Dr. Asier Sáez-Cirión of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The teen lives in the Paris area, and her identity was not revealed.

""This is an exciting story,"" but it is unknown if the remission will last, said Francoise Barré-Sinoussi, a scientist at the Pasteur Institute and a co-discoverer of HIV.

""This case is clearly additional evidence of the powerful benefit of starting treatment as soon as possible,"" she said.

Most HIV-infected moms in the United States get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies. The French teen's mother did not have her HIV under control in pregnancy, and doctors think her daughter was infected before or during birth.

The child stayed on HIV drugs until she was nearly 6, then doctors lost contact with her. When she came back a year later, her mother said she had stopped giving the girl HIV drugs. Yet doctors could not find HIV in her blood, so they decided not to resume treatment. Except for one brief rise when she was 11 that resolved on its own, her virus has remained below a detection threshold since.",21/07/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Thursday's letters: Gas tax pitch late to the game,"Bump up gas tax to pay for roads | July 13, letter

Pitch for gas tax is late, unhelpful

The Sierra Club representative's suggestion that Hillsborough County levy a gas tax to pay for road improvements is a little late to the party. For almost two years, Hillsborough's elected, appointed and volunteer leaders have been developing public and private consensus for a transportation referendum in November 2016 that would reflect the wishes of the various diverse communities and municipalities in Hills­borough County.

What has and is unfolding in Hillsborough is democracy at its finest. And the process is far from complete. Go Hillsborough leaders and supporters are proposing even more detailed and thorough analysis of public opinion — what the people want — as the planning process continues. More than 15,000 people have spoken, and there appears an appetite for a half-cent sales tax, the proceeds from which would be allocated to Hillsborough's municipalities and the unincorporated county to craft local solutions to local transportation challenges — including road improvements.

Given the intentional inclusion of thousands of citizens in the planning process for the 2016 referendum in Hillsborough County, it seems a bit arrogant (and suspect) for a sole entity like the Sierra Club now to come forward and recommend imposition of a 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax on the people.

Having helped to pass some very controversial public initiatives when I was with huge marketing agencies in Georgia in a past life makes me concerned that the Sierra Club poking its fingers into the planning pie this late will confuse voters and ultimately jeopardize the success of the referendum — and then we are all back to square one (like Pinellas and Polk counties). Surely that's not what anyone wants.

Baker Act needs fixing | July 5, editorial

Too many elderly drugged

The Baker Act is urgently in need of fixing not only as it applies to children but even more so as it applies to the elderly.

The privacy aspect is so overdone that someone could be held in a locked facility without being found by those who care about that person.

The trend in Florida seems to be to drug mentally ill people as opposed to counseling, which takes time and costs money. The people who are being drugged into submission are human beings and entitled to be treated as the unique but troubled people they are. Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of; it's also not a crime. Many medications or pain pills have terrible side effects.

People can be helped, but it takes time and money. The drugging one may endure during a three-day Baker Act confinement can damage a brain beyond repair, and it is wrong.

Coffee's turn | July 13

A rich history in Tampa

It was fun to read all about Tampa Bay's new homegrown coffee shops. It was not fun to read that the coffee scene was ""nonexistent"" before 2006. What?

Neighborhood coffee shops have been part of Tampa Latin life for over 100 years. They still are. So take yourself to Ybor City or West Tampa and savor a cafe con leche or cafe solo. While you're at it, forget about the calories and munch on Cuban toast.

The new kids on the block featured in the Times are building on Tampa's rich and longtime coffee tradition. We appreciate them and we cherish our coffee-drinking heritage.

Hard to take seriously

What is it with local television news? We have:

• Giggling news anchors.

• News anchors who speak in a sing-song voice.

• News anchors who can't pronounce proper names correctly.

• News anchors who don't enunciate clearly.

• ""News"" stories that are nothing more than cutesy videos of children and/or animals.

Are we supposed to take these people seriously?

An alarming rise in HIV cases July 13, editorial

Don't play condom roulette

Your editorial correctly points out that ""sexual abstinence remains the only foolproof form of HIV protection."" Condoms seem to most to be the answer, but condoms fail more than people imagine. Condom campaigns give a double message that people can be safe in risky behaviors when it takes only one condom failure to ruin health and a life. Condom roulette is not the answer.

President Donald Trump? That's not going to happen | July 14, commentary

Weak field of candidates

Carl Hiaasen again displays his intelligence and insight in accurately describing the poorly written sitcom known as Donald Trump's life.

Trump unfortunately is just the latest addition to what are largely circus sideshows running for president. Jim Webb is a notable exception, but the press seems intent on ignoring him.

This is undoubtedly the weakest cast of candidates, on both sides, in my lifetime.

We have Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, who will, let's not kid ourselves, undoubtedly be the nominees for their respective parties. They are recycled, tired examples of politics as usual. Jeb isn't toxic or clueless like his brother, but he lacks the gravitas and resume of accomplishment of his father, who was the best Bush by far.

Hillary is accomplished and intelligent, but she wouldn't have a snowball's chance of being where she is but for the ability and smarts, love him or hate him, of her husband. Both Jeb and Hillary are products of the ""family business"" of politics, and our founders didn't think that America benefited from a ruling class.

Though I didn't support him last time, it's unfortunate that Mitt Romney isn't running. He was accomplished in the private sector and proved he could get things done, including securing universal health care for Massachusetts.

Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Alarming rise in HIV cases,"Florida has the highest rate of new HIV infections in the nation, a troubling statistic for a dangerous disease that many people have foolishly quit fearing. And that is the root of the problem, one that government officials, educators and public health professionals need to aggressively fight right now.

Despite improvements in HIV medicines, there is no cure, and the infection remains a serious, often deadly condition. Agencies and educators need to urgently teach a new generation about the importance of HIV and AIDS prevention. They must also target an older population that has been lulled into a false sense of security by medical advances that have made the condition more manageable and lessened the stigma of living with HIV and AIDS.

Data released this spring by the Florida Department of Health presents a disturbing picture of HIV infections in Florida. The state had 5,821 new HIV infections in 2014, a 27 percent increase from 2012, when 4,593 new cases were recorded. The largest increase in new infections was among white and Hispanic men who have sex with other men, age 50 and above and ages 20 to 39. In the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County recorded a 63 percent increase in new cases since 2012. Pinellas County had a 32 percent increase in the same period. More recent data collected during the first few months of 2015 show that the numbers of new infections in the state continue to climb.

Public health experts struggle to pinpoint the reasons for the sharp rise in new HIV infections. But societal shifts in attitudes toward HIV are likely responsible. Among young people, for example, there is a lack of exposure to the large death tolls from HIV and AIDS infections, which spiked in the late 1980s and 1990s before many of them were born. The passage of time could contribute to lackadaisical attitudes about prevention methods such as condoms.

In Florida and around the country, public health officials should speak out about the dangers of HIV infection. Their message should be clear: Sexual abstinence remains the only foolproof form of HIV protection. Barring that, all sexually active people, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, are at risk for infection. The probability of HIV infection is particularly high among men who have sex with men, people who have sex with infected partners and people who share needles. Though antiretroviral therapy drugs make living with HIV easier, medications often have side effects, can be costly and must be taken for the rest of an infected person's life.

Parents, schools, churches and community organizations must take the lead in having difficult conversations with children about sexual health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 50 percent of young people who have HIV don't know it. The spike in infections among people over 50 also shows a need to engage adults. Last year, the CDC launched ""Start Talking. Stop HIV,"" an education campaign aimed at gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. That effort should be broadened to reach the entire population with age-appropriate messages about HIV prevention, testing, status disclosure and preventive medicines.

According to the CDC, 1.2 million people in the United States are infected with HIV. Worldwide, about 35 million people are infected. The public cannot afford to be silent on this issue. Inaction in the face of a preventable epidemic would be the greatest tragedy of all.",10/07/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Florida seeing highest number of new HIV cases in the nation,"At the height of the epidemic, the nurses wouldn't touch him. His mother had to give him a sponge bath in his hospital bed.

Michael Green, 43, of Tampa remembers the worst of those years: his AIDS diagnosis as a teenager, the terror and denial. Two decades later, he worries that a lack of education about HIV is contributing to a resurgence in diagnoses across Tampa Bay.

""They put HIV and AIDS on the back burner, like nothing's going on,"" Green said. ""If these kids had education, I think the numbers would start dropping.""

Florida now has the highest number of new HIV diagnoses in the nation, with Hillsborough County demonstrating the largest increase — 63 percent from 2012 to 2014. Pinellas County diagnoses increased 32 percent, according to recent Florida Department of Health numbers.

Officials trying to understand the surge point to complacency among young people.

""They were not around in the late '80s and the '90s when the HIV epidemic was at its peak, when people were dying, when the medications were not working,"" said Priya Rajkumar, vice president of Metro Wellness and Community Centers. ""We are heading towards an epidemic again.""

Community-based organizations have recorded upticks in diagnoses and clients across the Tampa Bay region. At Francis House in Tampa, which provides HIV support services, director of client services Vicky Oliver said too many people think they won't get infected.

""Back in the early '90s, people were afraid, so they were more knowledgeable,"" she said. ""Now they don't think it's a problem.""

In 2012, Hillsborough County had 273 new HIV diagnoses. By 2014, that number was 445, said Lisa Nugent, planning director at Suncoast Health Council.

""I tend to like to look at data over the long term. The longer I look at this, it is concerning,"" she said. ""We need to get to the root of where it's coming from.""

Population growth and more widespread testing may be contributing to the increase, she said.

The human immunodeficiency virus weakens the body's immune system, limiting its ability to protect itself from disease.

HIV can lead to AIDS, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by infection and a very low white blood cell count. HIV is spread mainly through sexual contact, primarily between men who have sex with men.

The annual number of new infections has fallen dramatically since the mid-1980s, when people with HIV and AIDS rarely lived longer than a few years. While there is no cure, improved treatments have slowed the disease's progression, allowing for longer lives. The steady rise in HIV diagnoses in Florida has continued into 2015, data show.

This week, the Centers for Disease Control granted Metro Wellness and Community Centers $350,000 over five years for HIV prevention and treatment, part of a $216 million push to address the nation's hardest-hit areas.

Metro's new primary care clinic for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals also offers HIV and AIDS care.

Twenty-somethings have shown very high rates of infection in this area, Rajkumar said.

""We think there's a disconnect with what the disease was and what it is today,"" she said. Without living through the death and hardship, without the media coverage and activism, young people don't necessarily grasp how serious the condition remains, she said.

Rajkumar said 10 people have gotten new HIV diagnoses at Metro in June, a striking jump from the monthly average of two to four.

""This month, all of a sudden, it was off the charts,"" she said.

The spike is not limited to Hillsborough. The AIDS Service Association of Pinellas, Inc. has also noted an increase in diagnoses, especially among young men who have sex with men.

""It's certainly a cause for concern,"" said executive director William Harper. ""It makes us realize that perhaps people are not hearing the message.""

He said fluffy messaging tends not to create the needed urgency, and that young people may be tuning out the efforts to reach them. A misperception endures that HIV is now a one-pill-per-day condition, he said, while its effects are much more complex.

In 1996, when Harper was a case manager, not a month passed without the death of at least one client.

""You constantly heard about people losing their partners, their friends,"" he said. ""And you don't see or hear that information at this time.""

• • •

After Green was diagnosed in 1987, he isolated himself. After months of denial, he got sick. Doctors said he had a year to live.

He got on medication — 20-plus pills per day. But he let his life spiral, abusing alcohol and drugs. He attempted suicide, ready for the end.

Six years ago, about the time he had a massive heart attack, he walked into Francis House and turned his life around. Now he's a volunteer cook there.

The disease still affects him. He'll be taking medication for the rest of his life — $4,000 per month, made affordable with Medicaid and Medicare.

""I don't wish this on nobody,"" he said. ""I'm not glad that people are being diagnosed, but it's good that the numbers are really coming in because it shows that people are out there getting tested.""

Green talks to college students about what he's endured. But he worries they don't take prevention seriously.

""They think it's all laughs and jokes,"" he said. ""This generation, they think it's okay because we don't talk about it.""

Tampa Bay Times,Most people spend too much time sitting at their desks,"The average office worker sits about 10 hours a day. There are all those hours in front of the computer, plowing through emails, making calls or writing proposals — and eating lunch. And then there are hours sitting in front of the TV or surfing the Web at home.

Medical researchers have long warned that prolonged sitting is dangerous, associated with a significantly higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and depression, as well as muscle and joint problems. Some have gone on to say that the office chair is worse for your health than smoking and kills more people than HIV. Even working out vigorously before or after work may not compensate for extending sitting.

But now those researchers have come up with suggestions for how much time to sit and to stand that could dramatically change our work habits.

According to the expert statement released in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Americans should begin to stand, move and take breaks for at least two out of eight hours at work. Then Americans should gradually work up to spending at least half of your eight-hour work day in what researchers call these ""light-intensity activities.""

""Our whole culture invites you to take a seat. We say, 'Are you comfortable? Please take a seat.' So we know we have a huge job in front of us,"" said Gavin Bradley, director of Active Working, an international group aimed at reducing excessive sitting that, along with Public Health England, convened the expert panel. ""Our first order of business is to get people to spend two hours of their work day NOT sitting. However you do it, the point is to just get off your rear end.""

Bradley said the first level of activity is simply standing.

""I'm standing right now while I'm talking on the phone,"" he said. While the group endorses the use of sit/stand desks, Bradley said there are other activities that can get people to move for two hours during the work day. ""Taking your calls standing. Walking around. Pacing. Holding standing meetings. Walking meetings. Walking over to a colleague's desk instead of sending an email. Using the stairs instead of the elevator. Taking a lunch break. Simple stuff.""

Bradley himself has changed the way he works completely since taking on this challenge to get people out of their seats: He starts his day standing on a comfort mat and has his sit/stand desk programmed to tell him, through a pop up notification on his computer, to change his posture every 20 to 30 minutes.

""It's all about mixing it up,"" he said. ""Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. The muscles in your lower body are turned off. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again. These things are so simple they're almost stupid.""

Researchers have known about the link between inactivity and higher rates of sickness and mortality dating back to studies of bus drivers and office-based postal workers in the 1950s. And more recent observational studies comparing workers who sit for long periods against those who sit for fewer hours have found that sedentary workers have more than twice the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, a 13 percent increased risk of cancer and 17 percent increased risk of dying.

At the same time, with the rise of office work, the use of cars and buses rather than walking or bicycles, and the rise of leisure pursuits like TV and computer games that favor the couch potato, the world has become more sedentary. The World Health Organization estimates that 95 percent of the world's adult population is inactive, failing to meet minimum recommendations for health of 30 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity five times a week.

Authors of the new guidelines said they were a starting point only, and designed to give people some kind of research-based target, rather than rely on the claims made by the manufacturers of treadmill and sit-stand desks that are becoming all the rage.

""This is an initial guidance, which we do expect to have to evolve with time,"" said James Buckley, one of the report authors and a professor at the Institute of Medicine at the University Centre Shrewsbury and University of Chester. ""But to ensure the marketing and promotions people to race away with self-determined claims, we have felt it is better to have some guidance rather than no guidance that is some how linked with scientific evidence.""

James Levine, an obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic and author of the book, Stand Up, though not involved in the guidelines, said they were a good start. In his work, he found that the reason why some people seem to eat a lot, never work out, yet never put on weight, is because they're standing, walking and moving more throughout the day, rather than sitting for hours on end.

""The guidelines show we need to fundamentally rethink the way we're working,"" Levine said. Some small studies, he said, have found not only health improved, but productivity ticked up 15 percent when people stood and moved more during the day. ""The way we have developed our workplaces and even our schools is actually profoundly unhealthy. It's a real design failure.""",03/06/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Don't delay: Study confirms early treatment is best for HIV,"HED WILL GO HERE AND GO HERE

A major international study says don't delay in seeking HIV treatment: Starting medication soon after diagnosis helps keep people healthy longer. People who started anti-AIDS drugs while their immune system was still strong were far less likely to develop AIDS or other serious illnesses than if they waited until blood tests showed their immune system was starting to weaken, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday. The findings are preliminary, but the NIH found them so compelling that it stopped the study a year early, so that all the participants could receive medication as researchers continue to track their health.

HED WILL GO HERE AND GO HERE

A federal appeals court struck down one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions Wednesday, agreeing with a lower court that ruled an Arkansas law unconstitutionally burdens women by banning abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy if a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with doctors who challenged the law, ruling that abortion restrictions must be based on a fetus' ability to live outside the womb. The ruling upholds a decision of a federal judge in Arkansas who struck down the 2013 law before it could take effect, shortly after legislators approved the change.

Tampa Bay Times,The lawyer whose client is a chimp,"Should chimpanzees — complex creatures with thoughts, feelings and the ability to learn sign language — have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?

Steven Wise, a prominent animal rights attorney from South Florida, has bet his career on it.

Our cousin the ape is poised to take an evolutionary new step — this time across the threshold into the courthouse. Leading the legal effort is Wise, 64, founder, president and chief litigator of the Nonhuman Rights Project.

On Wednesday, Wise will argue that two of his clients — chimps Leo and Hercules, being used for research at Stony Brook University in Long Island — have fundamental rights that protect them from being held captive.

Judge and jury: New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe, the first judge to order a university to explain why it is holding a chimp captive.

A courtroom victory could herald the end of chimps' use in biomedical research, animal rights advocates say. ""If we win, it's one baby step forward,"" said Wise, whose efforts are part of an international movement to establish rights for the great ape, humans' closest relative.

""We think Leo and Hercules have been locked in cages for six years,"" Wise said. ""They suffer the way we would suffer if we were imprisoned in a cage. They can remember the past and they can imagine the future. We're just trying to get them out of there.""

Stony Brook spokeswoman Lauren Sheprow declined comment, citing the pending litigation.

""The main thing is, can you get a hearing?"" Wise said. ""And that was the big breakthrough. The first three judges said, 'Get out of my courtroom, a chimp is not a person.' This judge issued the writ of habeas corpus, which is meant to protect us from being held against our will. And that was a huge step forward.""

Primatologist Bob Ingersoll, who appeared in the 2011 documentary Project Nim, predicts Wise's work will unleash a worldwide shift in the way mankind treats animals. ""It's a game changer,"" Ingersoll said. ""This isn't just about the great apes. This is about dolphins and whales and cows and mice in labs.''

In recent days, Wise has been the center of a media blitz, granting interviews to TV and radio stations in Australia, France, Sweden and Britain. ""People are interested,"" Wise said. ""And they should be. This will be the first time in the history of the world that a judge will hear this argument in court. We're hoping judges will take a much more sophisticated view and question whether animals deserve rights.""

Following the case closely are people on the other side of the issue, researchers and scientists.

""Historically, chimpanzees have made invaluable contributions to science and medicine, including the development of vaccines for hepatitis A and B,"" said Frankie Trull, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research in Washington. ""Chimpanzees have helped scientists gain important insights into diseases such as hepatitis C, malaria, HIV and cancer.""

Should Wise win in court, Leo and Hercules would be released to the Save the Chimps wildlife sanctuary on the east coast of Florida, he said, even while the university files a likely appeal.

And if he loses? Wise and his legal team plan to keep litigating as long as it takes, until they find a judge willing to see chimps as beings deserving fundamental rights. ""We are pushing in New York and other states,"" said Wise, who estimates that about 3,000 chimps are being held captive in this country alone. ""We are linking up with groups in Australia and Argentina, France, Spain and England and working with lawyers there.""

For Wise, the upcoming court battle has been decades in the making. A graduate of Boston University Law School, Wise has practiced animal protection law for 30 years and taught animal rights at several law schools, including Harvard.

Wise is also trying to win freedom for Kiko and Tommy, two New York chimps being held in what Wise calls ""solitary confinement"" by private owners. ""No one should be able to imprison a chimpanzee in any environment, however one labels it, that does not allow her to live an autonomous and self-determining chimpanzee life with sufficient space to roam and climb, alongside a sufficiently large enough number of other chimpanzees, both males and females,"" Wise said.

His legal argument is not based on a rallying cry that chimps are people, but rather that they are ""legal persons"" as opposed to things. ""We chose chimps because we thought the scientific evidence was very strong that they are autonomous and have self determination,"" he said.

Elephants, dolphins and whales are also on Wise's list of creatures deserving a new lease on freedom.

""We're looking for chimp rights for chimps and elephant rights for elephants,"" Wise said. ""The rights need to match the animal. We think there should be rights for all species of great apes, elephants and whales and dolphins.""

Wise is preparing a lawsuit on behalf of a group of circus elephants, but would not say when and where.

""You can't just champion one animal,"" said Ingersoll, a longtime friend of Wise. ""He is my hero. He is getting something done that I never expected in my lifetime. I never expected a court in the country would allow a case like this to be heard. It's a miracle.""",24/05/2015
Tampa Bay Times,PolitiFact Florida: Abortion rights group gets it wrong on Bush and family planning,"A Democratic political action committee ripped Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, saying his positions as Florida's governor preview what he'd be like as commander in chief — particularly when it comes to women's issues.

Stephanie Schriock, president of the group Emily's List, said in an essay on Medium that Bush spent his two terms curbing women's reproductive and health rights. (Emily's List helps female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights.) Schriock ticked off several actions that ran counter to the group's stance, including Bush's support of abstinence-only sex education.

""And let's not forget that Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all,"" she wrote. We wondered what Schriock meant about Bush holding grant money hostage, so we took a closer look at the books.

We found only a few media mentions of a situation resembling a hostage crisis, and they were the same ones Emily's List sent to us as proof. The primary source was a March 2001 story in the Tampa Bay Times that focused on a budget request from Bush for lawmakers to consider during the legislative session.

The story detailed how Bush wanted $1 million of the state Department of Health's $5.7 million family-planning allocation to create education grants for chastity counseling. This would have mirrored some federally funded programs in the state that told teens to wait until marriage to have sex, without discussing birth control methods. Those programs, many of which were privately run by religious groups, operated under names like Best Friends, Sex Can Wait and Everyone's Not Doing It.

The request would have marked the first time the state would have funded an abstinence-based counseling program. The idea was criticized by sex education advocates and legislators who said that teaching abstinence didn't work. They also said diverting $1 million would keep many poor women from getting HIV tests, Pap smears, birth control counseling and other services at clinics and county health departments.

But except for a couple of mentions in other articles about the proposal, the March 2001 Times article was the only place we found that the request was fully examined. Even Emily's List couldn't tell us what happened to Bush's proposal. It did tell us its aim was to point out Bush had made clear he preferred abstinence-only counseling and was willing to put conditions on funding to achieve that goal. That doesn't strike us as Bush preventing that money from being used for regular family planning services, however.

Though the Times story says the request was supported by then-Health Secretary Bob Brooks, it was still just a request. Florida governors routinely submit a proposed budget each year before the session, but the Legislature has the final say on how money is spent. It appears that in 2001 lawmakers didn't follow Bush's wishes.

The state Department of Health shared appropriations for family planning services going back to 2000 and found nothing specifying that funds had to go to abstinence-education exclusively.

""It does not appear that there was any proviso language that directed $1 million to be spent on chastity programs from the family planning category,"" spokeswoman Mara Burger told us. The 2001 appropriation for family planning was almost $5.8 million, a figure that has since fallen to $4.2 million today.

Florida continues to specify abstinence should be taught as a part of sex ed classes, although school districts are given plenty of leeway. The state is still one of the biggest recipients of federal money for chastity programs. Even anti-Obamacare Republicans in the Legislature agreed in 2012 to take millions set aside for abstinence education in the Affordable Care Act, even while rejecting other aid tied to the law.

So Emily's List said, ""Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all.""

There are a handful of news stories that say Bush in 2001 asked the Legislature to set aside $1 million for chastity programs out of the state's almost $5.8 million for family planning. That's a bit different from threatening existing programs with a gag order. More important, there's no evidence Bush's proposal went into effect. The Health Department said no requirements for abstinence programs were passed by lawmakers.

We rate the statement Mostly False.

Tampa Bay Times,Six alarming health trends every woman needs to know,"Researchers at the Institute for Women's Policy Research recently crunched nearly two decades worth of national data to gauge female wellness across the country — and uncovered a roster of disturbing health trends.

While certain indicators have generally improved in recent years — national mortality rates from heart disease and breast cancer have dipped, for example — several others show a need for prompt attention, said Cynthia Hess, study director at IWPR.

""Health isn't something that exists in a vacuum,"" said Hess, who used data from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey. ""It's connected to economic security, access to affordable health care, housing quality, access to healthy food and racism.""

To reverse the alarming trends, policymakers must address what may be driving maladies in roughly half the population, she said. One compelling reason: Health spending is projected to be 19.3 percent of GDP by 2023, up from 17.2 percent in 2012, according to CMS. Here are the top six highlighted in a massive new report, published this week.

1. Chlamydia is on the rise in every state, especially North Dakota and Massachusetts.

The incidence of chlamydia among American women of all ages surged 37 percent between 2002 and 2013, from 455 to 623 per 100,000. Men also saw a major increase (but the male rate remains lower): 60 to 263 per 100,000.

Every state saw an increase in cases of the sexually transmitted infection, which, if left untreated, can trigger pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. But the increases varied drastically, the report points out: North Dakota had the largest at 118 percent (257 to 559 per 100,000), followed by Massachusetts (249 to 559 per 100,000) and Arkansas (425 to 755 per 100,000).

Women in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, are the most likely to have Chlamydia, the findings show, and those in New Hampshire are the least. Most people who carry the infection show no symptoms, according to the CDC. More reported cases, however, may not actually signify worsening sexual health, Hess said: ""It's possible tests are getting better and more sensitive, and more people are becoming aware they have it.""

2. Mental health is declining across the country — worst of all in Oklahoma and Alabama.

More women reported feeling distressed in all states but four. The median number of days per month women nationwide reported experiencing poor mental health — anxiety, depression, stress — increased from 3.8 to 4.2 between 2000 and 2013, or about 11 percent. Only women in Washington, D.C., New Mexico, Virginia and Wisconsin reported fewer mentally rough days. The Midwest appears to be faring particularly badly.

3. More American women are committing suicide.

The suicide mortality rate among U.S. women grew 35 percent between 2001 and 2013, from 4 to 5.4 per 100,000. Every state saw an increase over this period. It's hard to say why, Hess said, but previous research suggests times of economic hardship — the recession, for example — increases a population's risk of depression.

The suicide mortality rate of Washington, D.C., which had the lowest rate in 2001, more than doubled between 2001 and 2013, from 1.3 per to 3.1 per 100,000. (D.C., however, still holds the lowest rate.)

Montana, which ranked 42nd in 2001, also saw a large increase, from 5.7 to 10.8 per 100,000 — more than double the national average. Other states with tragic upswings: South Dakota (3.6 to 6.2 per 100,000), Iowa (3.1 to 5.3 per 100,000), and Vermont (3.7 to 6.3 per 100,000).

Rates varied by ethnicity. White women and Native American women are most likely to commit suicide.

4. A black woman is nearly thirty times more likely to have AIDs than an Asian woman.

Incidence rates of AIDS for black women — 28 per 100,000 — are nearly six times higher than the rate for all women, the report found. That's about thirty times higher than among Asian women (.9 per 100,000) and roughly twenty times higher than white women's rate (1.2 per 100,000). Black women are also most likely to get tested for HIV. Sixty percent have been tested compared with only 30 percent of Asian and white women.

5. Fewer than half of American women get regular exercise.

Only 48.2 percent of U.S. women hit the gym — or yoga studio, or hiking trail — with any regularity, the study found. Women in Colorado and Vermont are the most active, with 59 percent of women reporting at least 150 minutes of exercise per week. At the bottom at Mississippi (33.1 percent), Tennessee (34.7 percent) and Arkansas (38.1 percent).

Between 2000 and 2013, the average number of days each month women reported their activities were limited by the state of their mental or physical health increased from 3.5 to 4.6, or about 31 percent. Nebraska and Kentucky experienced small improvements here. All other states saw a decline. Obesity is also growing concern for U.S. women: Nearly six in 10 women are overweight, or have a body mass index of 25 or greater, the report said.

6. More women report having diabetes, particularly black and Native American women.

Diabetes drives up risk of stroke, heart disease and blindness. Ten percent of U.S. women and 10.4 percent of men report they have diabetes, according to the CDC.

Between 2001 and 2013, the median percentage of women across the country who have ever been told they have diabetes rose from 6.5 percent to 9.7 percent — a 49 percent surge, the IWPR report found. Arizona saw the largest rise: 4.9 percent in 2001 to 10.0 percent in 2013, a 104 percent increase. Montana had the smallest: 6.2 percent to 7.0 percent, a 13 percent increase.

Rates didn't budge much in Georgia, Connecticut, Hawaii, Colorado and Mississippi.

Tampa Bay Times,"A PolitiFact guide: How the Clinton Foundation did, and did not, meet its White House agreement on donations","As they say at the ballpark, you can't tell the players without a scorecard. When Hillary Clinton was nominated as secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation signed an agreement seeking to avoid conflicts of interest between the foundation and Clinton's Cabinet post.

Now that Hillary is running for president, much has been made about how the Clinton Foundation did, or did not, keep up its end of the bargain.

PolitiFact and PunditFact offer this guide to help you connect the dots. Here are the promises, and whether or not the Clinton Foundation has been shown to have fallen short of its obligations. We'll go through each of the lapses in more detail.

Report contributors

We know, thanks to the Washington Post, that the government of Algeria gave $500,000 to the foundation in 2010. The foundation failed to report that until 2015 and did not notify the State Department. At the time, Algeria had hired the K Street lobbyists at Foley Hoag to ""promote Algerian-U.S. relations and respect for human rights,"" according to government filings.

The foundation issued a statement saying all of the money was used for earthquake relief in Haiti, but the State Department was never notified as the two sides had agreed.

""This donation was disclosed publicly on the Clinton Foundation website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed,"" the statement said.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""The fact that the process has … was not followed in this particular incident does not raise concerns with us.""

Also at issue are more than 1,000 donors who passed their contributions through a sister Canadian foundation that then gave money to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (the new name for the Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative), according to Bloomberg. The foundation reported the revenue from the Canadian foundation, but not the donors to the foundation itself.

Frank Giustra, the Canadian billionaire mining and entertainment financier who originally financed the program that bears his name, issued a statement to rebut suspicions of shady dealings. Giustra said he hosted a gala in March 2008 in Toronto to raise money for his Canadian branch of the Clinton Foundation program.

""Donations were made to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) to allow Canadian residents to receive a charitable tax credit while supporting our efforts,"" Giustra said. ""There were over 1,000 attendees who contributed and collectively pledged over $16,000,000 (Canadian).""

Giustra claimed that Canadian law prevents naming donors without their permission.

""We will not share or publicly disclose our donors' information unless we received prior written consent,"" Giustra said. He added that he would go back to the donors and ask for permission.

However, Bloomberg and the New York Times said that Canadian law might allow disclosure, and that if the donors had wanted to give directly to the Clinton Foundation, they could have done so and still received the tax benefit of giving to charity.

Clinton health donors

The Clinton Health Access Initiative failed to update its donor lists from 2010 to 2013, as Reuters has reported. During that time, five new countries made donations: Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Swaziland, Sweden and Switzerland (six if you count Flanders, which is part of Belgium and made a donation through the Flanders International Cooperation Agency).

Two other nations, the United Kingdom and Austria, significantly increased their giving.

The State Department should have been notified but was not.

Much of the health access initiative's work focuses on providing drugs and otherwise treating people facing HIV/AIDS, but it also trains local health workers. Asked why it hadn't updated it donor lists, spokeswoman Maura Daley said, ""Not doing so was an oversight which we made up for this year.""

Daley gave several reasons for the reporting lapses. The money from Swaziland and Papua New Guinea for small AIDS programs actually originated from other donors, Australia and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. Rwanda gave the charity $200,000 in 2012. The initiative considered this a fee for medical work it did in the country, not a grant or donation. Sweden provided millions to train health workers, but Sweden had been a donor before 2009.

Daley said her organization should have told the State Department about Switzerland's $340,000 donation.

State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach told the Boston Globe, ""We would have expected that CHAI identify for the department the foreign country donors that elected to materially increase their donations and new country donors.""

Soliciting funds

Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash, the exposé on the Clinton Foundation's practices, told us he believed Bill Clinton also violated the prohibition on soliciting funds for the Clinton Global Initiative.

Schweizer's evidence? Clinton continued to be the opening speaker at the start of the initiative's annual meetings. ""He is speaking at a CGI event where money is raised,"" Schweizer said. ""That's right on the line of soliciting funds in our opinion.""

It's unclear if Clinton's appearance violates the agreement, however. The memorandum of understanding signed in 2008 stated that ""President Clinton will continue in his role as principal host and be identified as CGI's Founding Chairman.""

Also, the big money that changes hands at the annual meetings goes directly from donors to doers, like nongovernmental aid groups, and never passes through the coffers of the foundation itself.

Post-State Department

Several news organizations have noted the renewed flow of money from foreign governments to the Clinton Global Initiative after Hillary Clinton left the State Department in 2013. Most recently, Politico noted that a phosphate company owned by the Moroccan monarchy gave $1 million to fund the latest meeting this month in Marrakech. The first international meeting of the global initiative was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

But whether the money comes from countries in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa or South America, the terms of the 2008 agreement don't apply.

The agreement applied during the time when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. It is fair game to highlight the involvement of foreign governments in the Clinton Foundation and the potential for countries gaining undue influence. However, that is separate from whether the foundation did what it said it would do.

Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said that now that Hillary Clinton is a candidate for president, the meeting in Marrakech will be the last one held on foreign soil for as long as she is running for the White House or becomes its next occupant. Minassian said that donations by foreign governments will also stop.",08/05/2015
Tampa Bay Times,What's Jenn Marie Thorne reading?,"Nightstand

Jenn Marie Thorne

In her new YA novel, The Wrong Side of Right, Thorne, 34, takes on American politicians and their ""love children.'' At the age of 16, protagonist Kate Quinn is just getting her feet back on the ground after losing her mother in a car accident when a stranger, along with about a dozen of his staff members and the media, shows up at her door. Mark Cooper is a U.S. senator and Republican nominee for president. Word has leaked out that not only did he cheat on his wife, he fathered an illegitimate child. ""I decided to tell this as a YA story because being a teenager is that time in your life that you are seizing control of your destiny, and also, it seemed it was the season for political sex scandals, but you never heard from the kids involved,'' said Thorne. ""The ground underneath a teenager is unsteady enough as it is, and I was wondering what it would be like to have something like this happen to you while you are working through things.'' Thorne, who has a bachelor of fine arts degree in drama from New York University, lives with her husband and two young sons in Gulfport.

What's on your nightstand?

I believe you have to keep reading as an author, because you can't have output if you don't have input. I belong to a debut club, the Fearless Fifteeners, a group of over 100 new YA authors. It's a nice perk to have access to friends' books. I'm reading The Wrath of the Dawn by Renée Ahdieh. It's an adaptation of The Arabian Knights. It's very fun and very addictive. The last book I finished was Skyscraping by Cordelia Jensen. It's a novel in verse. It's about a girl who finds out her dad has an HIV diagnosis. It's heartbreaking.

How was it to read a novel in verse?

I admired the way she could address the different facets of emotional experience through the short form. You definitely feel the poignancy of the subject. It was very well done.

The launch of your book coincided with Hillary Clinton's announcement that she's running for president. It's interesting to think of role reversal here.

That would be a whole new twist. Actually, in my book, the stepmother character, Meg, is really smart, savvy and articulate. Meg would be a fantastic president, but she's uninterested in politics.

Tampa Bay Times,Capitol Buzz: Things to watch today in Tallahassee,"

Five days left, but of what?

Monday was supposed to mark the start of the final week of session. But after the House and Senate failed to find common ground on the budget last week, there's little doubt that lawmakers will have to extend past May 1 or come back to Tallahassee in May or June.

In the meantime, there are policy issues to tackle.

* The Senate will take final action on SB 382, which would tighten the regulations on assisted living facilities. One provision would require additional inspections for facilities that have already had violations.

* Also up for a vote is HB 321, which eliminates some of the barriers to HIV testing.

* Senators also discuss 14 cases involving people who were either killed or injured on account of government negligence and awarded more than $200,000 by a jury. The lawmakers must decide whether to approve the awards by passing so-called claim bills.

* The House has a much lighter schedule. The 13 bills on the calendar include a ban on powdered alcohol (HB 1247/SB 998/ ) and a prohibition on using drones to snap pictures on private property (HB 649/SB 766).",27/04/2015
Tampa Bay Times,"Indiana HIV outbreak, hepatitis C epidemic sparks CDC alert","INDIANAPOLIS — An Indiana county is experiencing nearly daily increases in new HIV infections tied to intravenous drug use, and health officials hope the situation prompts other states to closely track their hepatitis C and HIV rates to identify potential clusters of the diseases.

Indiana state health officials said Friday that the number of positive HIV tests so far this year has jumped to 142 in Scott County, which saw just three new HIV cases between 2009 and 2013, and has never seen more than five cases in a year, health officials said.

The new number includes 136 confirmed cases and 6 preliminary positives in the county, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky.

""We literally have new cases being reported every day,"" said Dr. Jerome Adams, the state's health commissioner.

Dr. Joan Duwve, chief medical consultant for the Indiana State Department of Health, said four out of five people infected in the outbreak have acknowledged using injectable drugs, mostly the painkiller Opana.

Federal health officials helping to contain the outbreak issued an alert to health departments nationwide on Friday, urging them to take steps to identify and track HIV and hepatitis C cases in an effort to prevent similar outbreaks elsewhere.

The CDC recorded a 150 percent increase in acute hepatitis C cases from 2010 to 2013, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention. Health officials say high rates of hepatitis C are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential HIV outbreak.

""The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning that we cannot let down our guard against these deadly infections,"" Mermin said.

The advisory urges health departments to review recent data on HIV and hepatitis C diagnoses, overdose deaths, drug arrests and admissions for drug treatment to identify communities at risk for unrecognized clusters of HIV and hepatitis C infections.

Hepatitis C can lead to liver cancer and is the leading reason for liver transplants.",25/04/2015
Tampa Bay Times,"Trigaux: Scientific proof that inventive Florida excels at more than suntans, spring breaks","Want proof that Florida can be celebrated for more than suntans and spring breaks?

Consider the seven innovators for 2015 just announced as inductees into the fledgling Florida Inventors Hall of Fame.

Sure, everyone will fixate on Henry Ford, one of the uber-familiar fathers of the American automotive industry and the first name listed among these magnificent seven inductees. Ford spent his later winters in Fort Myers as a neighbor, friend and sounding board on inventing with Thomas Edison, one of the inaugural year inductees last year to the hall of fame.

But the other inductees are still busy inventing, having already created innovations in the fight against cancer, the spread of damaging termites and HIV.

While only one U.S. patent is required to be considered for the hall of fame, the seven 2015 inductees collectively hold more than 430 U.S. patents.

""These were very inventive people,"" Paul Sanberg, senior vice president for research, innovation and economic development at the University of South Florida, said in an interview. Sanberg, an inventor on 109 U.S. and foreign patents, is one of those seven inductees this year, named for his discovery of novel approaches to drug and cell therapies to treat stroke and brain diseases and for founding the National Academy of Inventors.

Sanberg says he decided to found a place to celebrate Florida inventors after he toured the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He was surprised to see so few Floridians represented. Last year, the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame opened with six initial inductees, including Edison.

Sanberg hopes the attention paid to Florida inventors via a state hall of fame will raise their profile nationally, attract more investment money to the state and encourage more young Floridians to pursue their innovative ideas. He points with pride to the volume of patents recently generated at the universities across Central Florida, which outnumber the higher profile ""Research Triangle"" universities of Duke, University of North Carolina and North Carolina State.

""So there are a lot of innovative things besides great tourism in Florida,"" Sanberg says.

The inventors were nominated through an open process and elected by a selection committee of research and innovation leaders across the state headed by Randy Berridge, president of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council and a member of the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame advisory board.

The seven inventors will be inducted in Tampa at the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame second annual ceremony and gala in October.

Tampa Bay Times,Indiana residents feel embarrassed and misunderstood in national spotlight,"INDIANAPOLIS — At the Tin Roof, a live music joint near Lucas Oil Stadium, where the NCAA men's Final Four basketball tournament concludes Monday, bar manager Brittany Strohmeyer eyed a group of out-of-town fans. Do they view Indiana as she sees it, warm and hospitable? Or do they think her state is run by bigots?

Strohmeyer, 24, sighed. Even on a trip to New Orleans last week, ""everyone we met was like: What's going on in Indiana?""

Lately, the quiet heartland state best known for corn and car racing has become a bull's-eye for American judgment, a magnet for boycotts, a punching bag for late-night comics. Insults have proliferated across the Internet: ""Now entering Indiana,"" read one viral meme. ""Please turn back your clocks 200 years.""

""I love Indiana. I was born in Indiana. All my friends are in Indiana,"" native son David Letterman quipped on the Late Show. ""But I think Indiana's gone nuts.""

The spotlight has shone most intensely on the state's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which many feared would create a legal license for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The law was quickly amended, but during the past two weeks, Indiana has drawn national attention for other bizarre and troubling developments.

In rural Scott County, near the Kentucky border, Republican Gov. Mike Pence declared a public health emergency after dozens of people tested positive for HIV — the country's first epidemic outside an urban area in nearly 20 years.

In South Bend, Purvi Patel, 33, became the first woman in the nation to be tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of ""feticide"" — for an incident Patel has described as a miscarriage.

In Marion, an assistant fire chief was demoted for handing a black firefighter a rope tied into a noose.

And in rural Walkerton, a Christian pizza parlor employee was publicly pilloried and temporarily forced to close up shop after she told a TV reporter she would never deliver her pies to a same-sex wedding. A Go Fund Me page has since raised more than $840,000 for the store.

""It's been a tough week in the Hoosier State,"" Pence said Tuesday during a packed news conference about the religious freedom legislation.

For Pence, a potential presidential contender, the bad press might have personal consequences: His decision to sign the law infuriated some of Indiana's largest employers, and his efforts to defend the law on national TV have been widely panned. On Wednesday, Politico magazine ran a story headlined, ""The Week Mike Pence's 2016 Dreams Crumbled.""

But Hoosiers everywhere feel embarrassed and misunderstood. On Facebook, they post impassioned pleas: Don't believe what you've heard. On the streets of Indianapolis, they strike up friendlier than usual conversations with visiting basketball fans. And at Indianapolis International Airport, they've draped a big blue banner that reads ""Indy Welcomes All.""

""If only they could see who we really are, our Midwest hospitality,"" said Scott Prather, a 24-year-old nursing student who was born and raised in the city. ""Everyone talking badly about us needs to come visit.""

Mike Huber, chief executive of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, can't recall a time Indiana has endured such negative publicity. The most recent national scandal might have been when former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight infamously threw a chair across a basketball court.

(That, however, is often recalled with a sense of pride. Letterman recently declared: ""I'd rather have Bobby Knight as the governor of Indiana."")

""We can get depressed about it — or we can do something about it,"" Huber said. ""We're acknowledging that, as a state, we took some hits that will take years to rebound from. That has a unifying effect on leadership in the community, like nothing I've ever seen.""

Some crisis-management mavens already see the spin. Vanessa Stiles, former president of the Public Relations Society of America's Hoosier chapter who has worked extensively on the state capital's tourism brand, said the state can take advantage of the newfound attention and raise awareness for, say, gay rights and HIV prevention.

""The upside in this is: We were always flyover country,"" Stiles said. ""We weren't noticed. It's now our opportunity to be a leader in the situation. We can work hard and show everyone what we're made of — and have the power to make a national difference.""

For out-of-towners, skepticism lingers. Spencer Smith, 22, drove 10 hours from Norman, Okla., for this weekend's basketball festivities. The recent controversy, he said, colors his view of Indiana: ""It's like a cloud that hangs over the whole thing.""

But some Hoosiers flatly refuse to be defined by the stereotypes they suddenly hear pouring from talk-radio stations and late-night TV hosts.

At the Indiana State Soldiers and Sailors Monument, a centerpiece of downtown Indianapolis, Lauren Strack, 20, watched tourists snap photos against a back-lit NCAA sign. Across the street, the news of the day looped on a digital marquee above a local magazine's headquarters: ""Governor Pence has signed the clarification of the religious freedom bill.""

Strack flipped her long red hair and crossed her loosely tied combat boots. ""No one can judge us until they've been in our shoes,"" she said. ""We are not hillbillies.""",05/04/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg has vast potential,"It has a new name, a new leader and a new mission to improve the health of residents in St. Petersburg. It also is prepared to start spending millions of dollars a year to make a difference. If the ambitious plans come together, this nonprofit foundation may be the most enduring legacy of the former Bayfront Medical Center's sale to a for-profit hospital chain.

When the locally owned nonprofit hospital was sold in 2013 to Health Management Associates, the proceeds from the controversial sale were used to pay off Bayfront's debt and fund a nonprofit foundation with an unwieldy name and a vague purpose. The foundation, then called Bayfront Health Education and Research Organization, also used $42 million from the sale to keep a 20 percent equity in the hospital through a subsidiary. Since then, Bayfront Medical Center was renamed Bayfront Health St. Petersburg; Health Management Associates was acquired by another for-profit chain, Community Health Systems; and the foundation fell off the public's radar.

Now that low profile is changing fast. The foundation recently has been renamed Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg. It has an endowment of about $170 million, and it has hired an impressive chief executive officer with extensive experience in working with nonprofits, tackling housing and community health issues, and maximizing assets by obtaining matching grants from large foundations. President and CEO Randall Russell was hired after a national search and has directed nonprofits helping those with HIV or AIDS in Alabama and most recently in Seattle.

Russell has a sweeping mission to improve the St. Petersburg area's health. The foundation's board of trustees correctly recognized that the city's health challenges are affected by all sorts of social and economic factors, ranging from poverty to education to lack of access to health services. That gives the foundation wide latitude to consider investing in all sorts of experiments with an eye toward improving health, from community gardens to health clinics to exercise programs.

The quiet months used by the foundation's board to define the organization's mission and find the right CEO to run it appears to be time well spent. Russell told the Tampa Bay Times editorial board that the best ideas are those that originate within individual neighborhoods, not those forced upon local residents. He plans to spend a lot of time listening, hiring 10 or so staff members in the coming months and preparing to make roughly $5 million a year in grants starting this fall. The foundation will send the money to established providers and local organizations to deliver the services, and it will look for new, innovative programs as well as ones with established track records.

In its breadth and potential, the Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg is unlike any other effort to improve the health of city residents. While it was painful to watch a locally owned, nonprofit hospital with such deep roots in the city twice change hands to a for-profit national chain, the foundation could make a substantive difference in the quality of life and create a legacy that benefits generations.",03/04/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Barriers delay availability of approved medical marijuana,"TALLAHASSEE — A bill attempting to get the implementation of the state's Charlotte's Web marijuana law back on track has created a new dilemma for its sponsor: how to make it equitable for black farmers.

Under the existing law, only farms that have been in continuous existence for 30 years and grow 400,000 or more plants are eligible to bid for one of five licenses to cultivate and distribute the noneuphoric strain of cannabis for patients with epilepsy, cancer and chronic muscle spasms.

According to the Florida Department of Agriculture, there are 99 Florida farms that qualify. Left out, however, are hundreds of black farmers who say that 30 years ago they were not yet in business because they were arguing with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over discriminatory lending practices.

The result: the law has a ""disproportionately negative impact on minority farmers,'' said Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, sponsor of the original legislation, which passed on the last day of the 2014 session.

Bradley has filed a new bill, SB 7066, that attempts to expedite implementation of the law, which intended for the noneuphoric marijuana to be available to families by now. But with every step forward, he has found a new hurdle.

The law as written has ""carved out most of the small farms, not just the black farmers but the small farmers,'' said Howard Gunn, a cattle farmer from Ocala and president of the Florida Black Farmers Association, at a meeting of the Senate Health Policy Committee. ""We can't compete with those companies. It's a shame. It's a travesty.""

Bradley acknowledged the law's shortcomings after Gunn and three other members of the Florida Black Farmers Association urged senators to end the discrimination embedded in the 30-year rule. But, he added, the issue could potentially create yet another hurdle to implementing the already delayed law in the House, which inserted the discriminatory language last year.

""The purpose of this bill is to end the legal challenges and to fulfill a promise we made to these families,'' Bradley said. ""Anything that strays from that purpose is going to be a problem for many of us since that is the reason we are pursuing it this session.""

The Florida Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act was designed to allow growers to start cultivating marijuana low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and high in cannabidiol, or CBD, to respond to the demand by families of children with chronic seizures, such as Dravet syndrome. Those families see the CBD oil as their last-chance hope. The most well-known strain has been named ""Charlotte's Web.""

But implementation of the law has been delayed by a flawed rulemaking process and protracted litigation, driven primarily by growers unhappy with the criteria established by legislators in a last-minute deal last year between the House and Senate.

Since then, the Florida Department of Health has tried twice to write rules to implement the law only to have them challenged in court by growers or patients. The current rule is being challenged by the family of a 4-year-old Jacksonville girl with inoperable brain cancer.

Bradley's proposed legislation would expand the number of licensees to 20 nurseries and broaden the ailments covered to include multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, HIV and AIDS and other diseases.

The Senate Health Policy Committee voted unanimously for the bill Tuesday, but it faces an uphill battle in the House, where there is no companion legislation.

An amendment proposed by Sen. Oscar Braynon II, D-Miami, would have removed the 30-year criteria and allowed black farmers to more readily compete with other growers, but Bradley asked him to withdraw it with the promise that he would work with them.

Bradley said he is not fan of the discriminatory language inserted into the legislation last year by the House but hopes to find a resolution that ""will accomplish all of these goals at the same time.""

Proponents of medical marijuana also told the committee that the existing law doesn't go far enough. They cited research that suggests Charlotte's Web produced mixed results in patients with severe epilepsy and urged the committee to allow doctors to prescribe the level of euphoria-inducing THC a patient needs. The law now limits the level to 0.08 percent, and many suggested the level be flexible, based on research.

A constitutional amendment that would allow for full medical marijuana in Florida is proposed for the 2016 ballot and legislation to enact into law a similar proposal has been derailed this session. Legislative leaders have said they want to see cultivation and distribution of the low-THC strain before legalizing broad use of medical marijuana. Bradley and other proponents also hope that more research can be done to determine the appropriate levels of THC and CBD to treat specific ailments.

Meanwhile, many large farmers have privately conceded that they prefer the delay because they do not want to grow low-THC cannabis and would prefer to wait for lawmakers to approve the more profitable, higher potency strains.

""I'm long since past trying to figure out what motivates people to file legal challenges to delay implementation of this law,'' Bradley told the Times/Herald. ""I will tell you that it's cruel to deny these families that relief that they were promised. I sure hope that people aren't denying implementation of this for monetary purposes.""

Tampa Bay Times,Indiana governor overrides law to authorize needle exchange (w/video),"INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana Gov. Mike Pence overrode state law and his own anti-drug policies Thursday to authorize a short-term needle-exchange program designed to help contain HIV infections in a rural county where more than six dozen cases have been reported, all of them tied to intravenous drug use.

Pence issued an executive order declaring a public health emergency in Scott County, an economically depressed area about 30 miles north of Louisville, Ky., that has seen 79 new infections since December. The county typically sees only about five HIV cases each year, health officials said.

All of the infections have been linked to needle sharing among drug users.

Needle-exchange programs are illegal in Indiana, and Pence has opposed them as part of drug-control efforts. But his order allows Scott County officials to request state approval for a limited, short-term program.

The governor said he was acting to halt the spread of the virus ""despite my reservations"" about providing clean needles to addicts.

His order will run for 30 days.",27/03/2015

Tampa Bay Times,"Why it took so long for the world to start using 'smart,' self-destructing syringes","WASHINGTON — The World Health Organization called this week for the worldwide use of needle syringes that self-destruct after a single injection.

These ""smart"" syringes are a response to a problem that medical authorities have recognized for decades — the frequent reuse of disposable shots. An estimated 25 percent of the 18 billion medical injections performed worldwide each year are done with dirty needles. Unsafe injections cause as many as 1.7 million new hepatitis B infections annually, 315,000 hepatitis C infections and 33,800 HIV infections, according to the World Health Organization. Stopping these infections would be a boon for public health.

""This is a risk we don't have to be taking,"" the WHO's Lisa Hedman said.

But changing the practice, especially in poor countries, has proven difficult. In some places, syringes are scarce. Or the dangers are not fully appreciated, despite education campaigns. And sometimes health care providers can just get lazy.

So how do you stop people from reusing syringes?

How do you remove the temptation?

The WHO has been hunting for solutions for nearly 25 years. Only recently has the technology become feasible — cheap, easy to use, hard to break — for an announcement like the WHO made Monday.

""It's not simple,"" WHO spokeswoman Judith Mandelbaum-Schmid said. ""There had to be quite a lot of engineering.""

The WHO's quest began in 1987, just as the spread of a disease called HIV was beginning to cause alarm. At the same time, the widespread switch from glass syringe tubes to plastic ones made reuse even more risky, since glass containers could be disinfected with heat, while plastic melted and warped.

The agency put out a call for syringe designs that automatically and irrevocably stopped working after a single filling and injection. The syringes essentially needed to break after one use.

The WHO wanted to use these shots to deliver vaccines.

One place that took up the challenge was Path, a small international health technology nonprofit in Seattle. Staff already had begun playing around with different designs two years earlier. They knew they had to make their invention work with existing plastic syringes to keep costs down, said Steve Brooke, the company's commercialization adviser.

There were examples out there. Patents for single-use syringes dated back to 1960s. But none seemed to fit the need.

Path came up with a plastic syringe with a metal clip inside it that locked into place after the plunger was depressed. A syringe manufacturer licensed the product.

In 1990, the Soloshot hit the market. Since then, it has been used to deliver more than 6 billion vaccine shots.

But the Soloshot was limited to the vaccination market, which accounts for only 5 to 10 percent of all injections worldwide. The product didn't work in syringes with varying dosages, where the plunger is pulled back to different levels.

""People started to realize, what about the other 90 percent?"" said Hedman, who is the WHO's technical officer for essential medicines and health products.

Solving that problem would take several more years.

The effort received an unexpected boost in 2000 when the U.S. Congress passed the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, which required steps to reduce the risk of health care workers accidentally stabbing themselves with needles.

That led to inventions such as the spring-loaded needle, which retracts after use ""like a ballpoint pen,"" Hedman said. And there are syringes with plastic covers that can be slipped over a needle and locked into place.

Although these devices were designed to protect nurses and doctors, they also rendered the syringes inoperative after a single use.

Other designs came on the market. A man named Marc Koska developed the K-1 syringe, with a plunger that breaks off if you try to reload it. He's delivered TED talks about the experience.

Today, there are more than 70 suppliers of nonreusable syringes.

""But it took a long time for industry to respond,"" Hedman said.

The WHO's call to use self-destructing syringes is seen as a step to pushing for the widespread adoption of the devices. The technology works and is priced on par with regular syringes. The need is greatest in the developing world. But the reuse of syringes remains enough of a problem in the United States that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention runs a One & Only campaign to reinforce the message.

Unsafe medical injections have affected at least 150,000 U.S. patients since 2001, according to the CDC.

Preventing these exposures is as simple as a tiny flange that stops a syringe from being reloaded ""like going the wrong way out of a rental car parking lot,"" Hedman said.

She appreciated the simplicity of some of these solutions.

""They are elegant little things,"" she said.",25/02/2015
Tampa Bay Times,"Pills before and after sex can help prevent HIV, study finds","For the first time, a study shows that a drug used to treat HIV infection also can help prevent it when taken before and after risky sex by gay men.

The results offer hope of a more appealing way to help prevent the disease beyond taking daily pills and using condoms, though those methods are still considered best.

The study, done in France and Canada, is the first to test ""on demand"" use of Truvada, a pill combining two AIDS drugs, by people planning to have risky sex. The uninfected men who took it were 86 percent less likely to get HIV compared with men given dummy pills.

""That impressed me,"" Dr. Scott Hammer said of the size of the benefit. He is an AIDS specialist at Columbia University in New York and heads the Retrovirus Conference going on in Seattle, where the results were discussed Tuesday.

Daily Truvada pills are used now to prevent HIV infection in people at high risk for it, and studies show the drug helps even when some doses are skipped. Health officials have been leery of billing it as a ""chemical condom"" out of fear that people will not use the best prevention methods, but many won't use condoms all the time or take daily pills.

The study of Gilead Science's Truvada was led by the French national HIV research agency.

Men were given fake or real Truvada and told to take two pills from two to 24 hours before sex, a third pill 24 hours later, and a fourth pill 48 hours after the first dose. The men also were given condoms and disease prevention counseling.

The study was stopped early, in November, after 400 men were enrolled and researchers saw that the drug was working; there were two new HIV infections among those on Truvada and 14 in those on dummy pills. The two infections in the Truvada group were in men who stopped using the pills after more than a year in the study.

Another study presented at the conference, conducted by the U.K. Medical Research Council, found that daily use of Truvada cut the risk of infection by 86 percent in a ""real world"" test of gay men aware they were taking Truvada for HIV prevention. That study involved 545 gay men.",25/02/2015
Tampa Bay Times,AIDS the No. 1 killer of adolescents in Africa,"AIDS has become the leading cause of death for adolescents in Africa and the second-leading cause of death among adolescents globally, global health agencies said Tuesday.

Road accidents and injury are the No. 1 killer of adolescents globally, said Michael Hollingdale, a UNAIDS spokesman.

About 120,000 people age 10 to 19 died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2013, the eight international organizations said while launching a global campaign in Kenya to stem the spread of HIV.

Adolescent girls, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are most affected, said the organizations, which included UNAIDs, UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

In South Africa in 2013, more than 860 girls became infected with HIV every week, compared with 170 boys, they said.

Girls are more vulnerable because of physiological factors that see them more susceptible to infection, said Dr. Lilian Otiso, director of services at LVCT Health, a nongovernmental organization that deals with AIDS prevention and treatment across Kenya.

Social and economic factors that see girls having sex at younger ages than their male peers also play a major role, she said. They might date older men who can provide for them, she said. Others are forced to fend for themselves at young ages and become victims of sexual exploitation, abuse and rape, Otiso said.

The global campaign, called ""All In,"" will seek to address the imbalance by encouraging strategic changes in policy and involving more young people in the effort. Adolescents often don't come forward for testing and drop out of treatment regimes because their emotional needs aren't targeted, Otiso said.

The organizations said 2.1 million adolescents were living with HIV in 2013.",18/02/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Future of medical pot hazy in Florida,"TALLAHASSEE — Proposals by two Republican lawmakers to legalize medical marijuana have a slim chance of passing this legislative session, based on the comments of a Senate committee chairman who helps control the fate of that chamber's measure.

Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, created a buzz on Tuesday when he filed a bill that would expand Florida's limited medical marijuana law, approved last year but yet to be implemented.

Steube's proposal (HB 683) would allow doctors to order medical marijuana for patients with certain conditions but would not allow the pot to be smoked, a concession to the Florida Sheriffs Association, which came out in opposition to a similar bill (SB 528) released two weeks ago by Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg.

Both proposals would allow doctors to order medical marijuana for patients diagnosed with certain conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease and Crohn's disease. But, unlike the Senate plan, Steube's bill would not give doctors the leeway to order the pot for symptoms such as chronic pain or nausea.

Brandes said he would be willing to consider scaling back his proposal to align with Steube's non-smokable version. Florida voters in November narrowly rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized medical marijuana, including the smokable form.

""I think it (Steube's proposal) is a great first step. I'm excited that we're going to have this discussion in the Legislature and not a take-it-or-leave-it offer in the Constitution,"" Brandes said.

Even Steube's narrower version, however, may be on life support before getting an initial hearing in either chamber.

Lawmakers last year legalized cannabis that is low in euphoria-inducing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and high in cannabadiol, or CBD, for patients who suffer from severe spasms or cancer. Under the law, Department of Health officials were supposed to have selected five entities to grow, process and distribute the low-THC substance by Jan. 1.

But, because of a legal challenge, the regulations setting up the framework for the state's new pot industry are months away from going into effect, and patients may not be able to purchase the product until the fall.

Brandes' proposal is slated to be considered first by the Senate Regulated Industries Committee. But Chairman Rob Bradley, who sponsored last year's marijuana measure (SB 1030), isn't a fan of the broader bills now on tap.

""I'm of the school of thought that we need to allow this issue to naturally unfold by making sure that we crawl before we walk and walk before we run,"" Bradley, R-Fleming Island, told The News Service of Florida on Tuesday. ""I want to see 1030 (last year's measure) get implemented. And then let's see what works and what doesn't with regard to the bill that we've already passed.""

Bradley said he is especially leery of expanding Florida's current law because of problems caused by legalization of medical marijuana in states such as Colorado and California.

""It's much more difficult to scale back than it is to know what works, make sure you get that down and then ease into a system,"" he said.

Some lawmakers, however, want the Legislature to pass a bill to thwart a second attempt at a constitutional amendment.

Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, who spent at least $3 million getting Amendment 2 on the ballot last year, is gearing up to put a similar proposal on the 2016 ballot. Some Republicans fear the medical marijuana initiative would be much more likely to pass in a presidential election, when Democrats --- who might be more likely to support the effort --- show up in higher numbers than in mid-term elections like last year's. Amendment 2, which would have legalized medical marijuana, received 58 percent of the vote in November, just shy of the 60 percent required for passage.

""I certainly think that the Legislature should be the ones who address this issue. I'm optimistic that we can negotiate between the House and the Senate and maybe at least allow the members to fully vet the issue and hear from all the stakeholders and kind of go from there,"" Steube, R-Sarasota, told The News Service of Florida on Tuesday.

But Bradley, who controls whether the bill will be heard, remained unconvinced that the Legislature should act now.

She went on to work with aid groups in her home state of Arizona, as well as in countries such as India and Turkey. In August 2013, Mueller, 26, was abducted in the Syrian city of Aleppo as she left a hospital operated by the Spanish Doctors Without Borders group.

Her family shared some details of Mueller's life as they awaited verification of the ISIS claim that she was killed in a Jordanian airstrike.

""The common thread of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,"" a family statement said.

As a high school student at Tri City College Prep in Prescott, Mueller received awards for her volunteer efforts with groups such as AmeriCorps, America's Promise and Big Brothers Big Sisters.

She told her hometown newspaper, the Daily Courier, in 2007 that she was interested in world affairs and wanted to work with people in the strife-torn Darfur region of Sudan.

After graduating from Northern Arizona University in 2009, she lived and worked with aid groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories.

In 2011 she returned to Arizona, where she worked for an HIV-AIDS clinic and volunteered for a women's shelter. Late that year, she moved to southeastern France to learn French while working as an au pair in preparation for a move to Africa.

But the plight of families fleeing the violence in Syria drew her to Turkey in December 2012. She worked with the aid groups Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council.

""Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she is extremely devoted to the people of Syria,"" the family said. ""When asked what kept her going in her mission, she said, 'I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine; if this is how you are revealed to me, this is how I will forever seek you.' ""

Mueller shared some of her experiences with the Prescott Kiwanis Club in 2013, including a story of trying to reunite a father with his 6-year-old son after a bombing at a refugee camp in Turkey. She eventually found the boy as he came out of surgery at a hospital, but the man's wife had been killed.

""This story is not rare in Syria,"" Mueller said, according to an article in the Daily Courier. ""This is the reality for Syrians 2 1/2 years on. When Syrians hear I'm an American, they ask, 'Where is the world?' All I can do is cry with them because I don't know.""

She made a promise that day:

""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"" she said. ""It's important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are.""",07/02/2015
Tampa Bay Times,"Hackers infiltrate insurer Anthem, access customer details","The massive cyberattack against Anthem, the nation's second-largest health insurer, exposes a growing cyberthreat facing health care companies that experts say are often unprepared for large attacks.

Hackers gained access to the private data of 80 million former and current members and employees of Anthem in one of the largest medical-related cyber attacks in history.

Authorities said the attack, which was discovered late last month and disclosed this week, did not involve private health records or credit card numbers, but it did expose Social Security numbers, income data, birthdays, and street and email addresses.

Investigators suspect Chinese hackers may be responsible for the breach, the Washington Post reported, citing an individual briefed on some aspects of the inquiry.

Security experts said health care has become one of the ripest targets for hackers because of its vast stores of lucrative financial and medical information. Health insurers and hospitals, they added, have often struggled to mount the kinds of defenses used in large financial or retail companies, leaving key medical information vulnerable to attack.

While medical records, such as treatment details or test results, were not compromised in what Anthem called ""a very sophisticated attack,"" experts say the breach underlines the worrying potential for attackers to steal private health data valued on the black market as tools for extortion, fraud or identity theft. Medical information could be exploited, for example, to file false insurance claims and buy prescription drugs, and attackers could extort cash from policyholders desperate to keep their private medical data under wraps.

""Health care records are the new credit cards,"" said Ben Johnson, chief security strategist at cybersecurity firm Bit9 + Carbon Black. ""If someone gets your credit card number, you cancel it. If you have HIV, and that gets out, there's no getting that back.""

Anthem, formerly known as WellPoint, covers 1 in 9 Americans through its affiliate health plans, including under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brands. The breach has ""definite potential to be the largest"" hack of a health care organization, although it is too early in the investigation to say definitively, said Vitor De Souza, a spokesman for FireEye, which owns the company now helping with Anthem's security.

The data breach could affect individual policyholders as well as those enrolled in managed care plans through Medicaid. Anthem's chief executive, Joseph Swedish, was among those to have their personal data exposed. The company does not operate in Florida.

Once Anthem discovered the data breach Jan. 29, company officials contacted the FBI and retained Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, to investigate the attack and review the insurer's defenses. The FBI said it is investigating the breach, which was first reported Thursday by the Wall Street Journal.

Hackers were able to grab some of what experts called the most lucrative and damaging types of stolen personal data. Social Security numbers are an attractive target because they are tough to change and crucial to government, financial and medical use.

A set of complete health insurance credentials sold for $20 on underground markets in 2013 — 10 to 20 times more than a U.S. credit card number with a security code, according to Dell SecureWorks.

Medical information includes key identifying details that could be used to create a ""fake patient"" that could fraudulently bill programs such as Medicaid, experts said.

""What we've seen in the last few years is that attackers have realized the economics of health care data are very, very attractive,"" said Lee Weiner, senior vice president at cybersecurity firm Rapid7.

The link to Chinese hackers, which was first reported by Bloomberg News, means the attack could be part of a larger campaign, experts say.

Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said he has seen Chinese government hackers target health care providers and insurance companies in the past six months for Social Security numbers and personal identifying information as well as health care information.

China has also been implicated in hacks on USIS, a major U.S. contractor that conducts background checks for the Department of Homeland Security. The Chinese have also targeted state motor vehicle departments and other agencies with large databases, Alperovitch said.

""The more information the Chinese have about large segments of the American population, the easier it is for them to penetrate our military and intelligence agencies,"" said Joel Brenner, former U.S. national counterintelligence executive. ""They then have the health care information, the fingerprints and the real names of an enormous set of people, many of whom are prime recruits for our intelligence services or our military or who are already in our military. It's an enormous advantage in penetrating cover.""",05/02/2015
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Positive step forward on medical marijuana,"The effort to legalize medical marijuana in Florida has found its rightful home in the Florida Legislature. Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, has introduced promising legislation that would make the drug legal for patients with specific medical conditions who have not found pain relief through traditional medicine. Brandes and the bill's early supporters, which include Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, clearly understand the will of the voters, who voted overwhelmingly to legalize medical marijuana in November but fell just shy of the 60 percent level needed to pass a constitutional amendment. As the bill makes it way through committees, lawmakers can adjust it so that the legislation best serves Floridians in pain and protects the public from abuse.

The bill, called the Florida Medical Marijuana Act (SB 528), addresses many of the issues that concerned opponents of the constitutional amendment. It tightens the definition for qualifying patients, allowing physicians to recommend the drug only to patients with specific medical conditions including cancer, HIV, AIDS, epilepsy, ALS, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease and Parkinson's disease. The act also allows treatment of named chronic conditions such as wasting syndrome, severe muscle spasms, nausea, pain and seizures. Satisfying another concern about the proposed amendment, the measure provides for licensed caregivers who are at least 21 years old and who pass a criminal background check to pick up and administer the drugs to qualifying patients.

As in Amendment 2, the Brandes bill requires the Department of Health to regulate the industry and maintain a database of registered patients, caregivers and physicians. The bill also requires doctors to have a three-month treatment relationship with a patient before recommending medical marijuana, and it provides for a 30-day supply of the drug to be issued at one time. Abuse by doctors, patients or caregivers could result in a misdemeanor charge.

More than 57 percent of Florida voters supported the failed effort to legalize medical marijuana through a constitutional amendment. Brandes' bill is a good-faith effort to provide relief to suffering Floridians. Now other legislators should help craft a solution that will work for Floridians. Expanding the bill's local control provision is a good place to start. The bill now requires county commissions to approve the number and location of medical marijuana retail facilities in their jurisdictions before state licenses are issued. The measure also should require input from city governments, and no local governments should be able to ban any facilities from opening. Legislators also should examine a clause in the bill that indicates that a doctor can recommend medical marijuana for a patient only after exhausting all other ""reasonable alternative medical options."" Decisions about treatment are best handled between a patient and a doctor, not meted out by state law.

It is encouraging that some of the most vocal opponents of last year's push to legalize medical marijuana are early supporters of this legislative answer. Gualtieri says he favors the bill, and the Florida Sheriff's Association seems poised to get on board. Legislators cannot afford to be tone deaf and should pass a measure this session that positions the industry to get up and running quickly. The alternative, where access to medical marijuana remains blocked and the drug's supporters make another run at amending the state Constitution, would not produce the best results.",31/01/2015
Tampa Bay Times,St. Petersburg Republican lawmaker sponsors new medical marijuana bill,"Seriously sick Floridians and those who can't find adequate prescription drugs would be allowed access to ""medical-grade"" marijuana under a major cannabis bill filed Monday by a top Florida Republican state senator.

St. Petersburg Sen. Jeff Brandes' 28-page legislation, the most far-reaching of its kind by a top legislative leader, seeks to regulate the cultivation, distribution and use of medical marijuana in Florida.

The bill mirrors parts of a proposed constitutional amendment that garnered 57.6 percent of the vote. That amendment, which failed because it didn't meet a 60 percent threshold for approval, has been redrafted and could appear on the 2016 ballot.

Brandes said he opposed the amendment, largely because he thought the Legislature should be in charge of making such a major change to health care and criminal law in Florida.

""We should allow for physicians and patients to make decisions about their medical care,"" Brandes said. ""It's about the physician-patient relationship — for me, that's the compelling reason. You hear stories of people struggling.""

The proponents of the medical-marijuana constitutional amendment cheered Brandes' proposal.

""Floridians have spoken on the issue of medical marijuana and Sen. Brandes has heard them,"" said Ben Pollara, the executive director of the United for Care group that has back the proposed amendments.

""This is a tremendous step towards passing a medical marijuana law without having to bring the issue back to voters in 2016,"" Pollara said.

Before the United for Care proposals, medical-marijuana was stifled by the GOP-led Legislature.

But after the amendment was headed for the 2014 ballot, the Legislature passed a scaled-back law that only legalized a low-THC strain of marijuana that's often used to treat people with epilepsy. That law, nicknamed ""Charlotte's Web,"" hasn't gone into effect because it has been bound up in court challenges and bureaucratic red tape.

Under Brandes' legislation, qualified patients could receive as much as a 30-day supply of marijuana from a licensed, regulated facility as long as they were properly examined by a physician, who would have to write a prescription-like recommendation for the drug.

Brandes, the chairman of the Senate's transportation committee and a member of its criminal justice committee, said he believes more people should have the right to access marijuana as long as it's properly regulated and recommended by a physician. He said he expects to have a House sponsor for the legislation in the coming weeks. The 60-day legislative session begins in March.

""I've talked to the governor directly. I've talked to the Senate president,"" Brandes said. ""I've talked to the leadership in the House — not the speaker, but the leadership — and I think they're open minded. I'm not going to say it's a slam dunk.""

Conservatives still have grave reservations about changing marijuana laws in Florida.

In Brandes' home town, the Drug Free America Foundation is a bulwark of opposition to medical marijuana. The foundation was founded by former U.S. Ambassador Mel Sembler, who helped spearhead the Drug Free Florida committee that opposed the medical-marijuana amendment in 2014.

After the election, however, Republicans took note of the broad support for medical marijuana.

Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, told the Bradenton Herald last week that the issue had a better shot of passing this year.

""It would need to be very strictly regulated,"" Steube told the paper. ""We would want the bill to say, 'Here are the medical issues you can take it for, that's it.""

Brandes' bill does spell out these specific medical conditions: cancer, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe and persistent pain, severe and persistent nausea, persistent seizures, severe and persistent muscle spasms.

Those people who suffer from these ailments would be allowed access to medical marijuana.

Tampa Bay Times,Fla. GOP senator files major medical-marijuana bill,"Florida medical physicians would be allowed to prescribe ""medical-grade"" marijuana to needy patients under a major cannabis bill filed Monday by a top Florida Republican state senator.

The legislation proposed by Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, would allow people who have specified serious medical conditions -- such as cancer, AIDS or epilepsy -- to receive and use medical marijuana if a doctor certifies its use. Patients would be limited to a 30-day supply.

But the bill goes a step further and says that doctors could certify medical-marijuana use for other patients who have exhausted other medical treatments first.

Whether Republican Gov. Rick Scott would sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law is too early to tell. Scott, who reversed course last year and opted to sign the Charlotte's Web bill into law, often doesn't comment on pending legislation, especially in its early stages.

Because Florida's Charlotte's Web law is so restrictive, the Sunshine State isn't counted among the 23 that have legalized cannabis for medical use. Four of those states -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- have legalized the drug for non-medical use along with Washington DC.

Brandes's sweeping 28-page bill would give the Department of Health broad authority to set standards for and regulate the cultivation and dispensing of medical marijuana. The legislation seeks to prohibit any marijuana possession at schools or in prisons and would only allow licensed patients or designated caregivers to possess the drug or marijuana paraphernalia for medical use.

To make sure local governments have a say, the legislation say the state can't license a marijuana retail store in a county without the approval of county commissioners.

Other aspects of the bill, according to Brandes' office, include:",26/01/2015
Tampa Bay Times,In the news: Two male porn actors test positive for HIV,"Weaker standards

2 porn actors test positive for HIV on set

Two adult film actors have contracted HIV, with one most likely infecting the other during unprotected sex at a film shoot in Nevada where testing was less stringent than industry standards, officials said.

One of the actors had previously tested negative before a pair of film shoots, but then began showing symptoms during the second shoot and was later found to be HIV-positive, the California Department of Public Health said Monday. Another actor from the second shoot later tested positive, it said.

The infections came amid a major decline in porn filming in Los Angeles County — once the U.S. center of porn production — after the 2012 passage of a law requiring porn actors to use condoms. The number of porn filmmakers applying for shooting permits declined from 485 in 2012 to 40 in 2013.

The Free Speech Coalition, a California trade group for the adult film industry, said the pair of film shoots linked to the two infections occurred in September on a Nevada set using tests that do not detect HIV as early as tests done on sets that fully comply with industry standards.

An on-set HIV infection in 2004 had been the last such confirmed case.

Tampa Bay Times,"In shift, FDA says gay and bisexual men will be able to donate blood","WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it would scrap a decades-old lifetime prohibition on blood donation by gay and bisexual men, a stride toward ending what many had seen as a policy of discrimination.

However, the agency will continue to ban men who have been sexually active in the past year, saying that the barrier is necessary to keep the blood supply safe, a move that frustrated rights groups that were pushing for the ban to be removed entirely.

The FDA enacted the ban in 1983, early in the AIDS epidemic. At the time, little was known about the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes the disease, and there was no quick test to determine whether somebody had it. But science — and the understanding of HIV in particular — has advanced in the intervening decades. On Tuesday the FDA acknowledged as much, lifting the lifetime ban but keeping in place a block on donations by men who have had sex with other men in the past 12 months.

The new 12-month waiting period imposes on gay men the same restriction as that imposed on heterosexuals who engage in high-risk behavior, including sex with prostitutes or with people who inject drugs.

The shift puts the United States on par with many European countries, including Britain, which adjusted its lifetime ban in favor of a 12-month restriction in 2011.

Most men's health advocates called the move long overdue, and said that the overall ban was not based on the latest science and that it perpetuated stigma about gay men as a risk to the health of the nation. Legal experts said the change brought an important national health policy in line with other legal and political rights for gay Americans, like permitting gay people to marry and to serve openly in the military.

GMHC, the advocacy group formerly known as Gay Men's Health Crisis, called the new policy ""offensive and harmful."" AIDS United, a Washington-based lobbying group, said that it was a ""step forward,"" but that it ""continues to perpetuate discrimination against gay and bisexual men.""",23/12/2014
Tampa Bay Times,Column: Vaccines provide healthy life for millions of children overseas,"The infant starts crying as he takes his first breath of outside air. The cord is clamped and cut, and he's handed to mom for skin-to-skin bonding time. Then he's handed off to the pediatric team for a quick examination. During his first few days of life he receives the hepatitis B vaccine, and later his routine vaccinations. Immunizations protect him from life-threatening diseases. We take this for granted in the United States, but a child across the globe may be dying right now from one of those very diseases because vaccinations are not available in his village.

I am Robyn Schickler, a resident physician in obstetrics and gynecology, a graduate of the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. I have delivered hundreds of babies who will live a healthy life, protected from these life-threatening diseases. But babies all over the world are not lucky enough to have this protection. Of the 6.3 million kids under five who die each year, 1 in 4 dies due to pneumonia or diarrhea even as vaccinations against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus, the causes of pneumonia and diarrhea, are now delivered economically in many countries by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

I am Jerry Trotter, a first-year medical student at the USF Morsani College of Medicine and a former Marine. In 2005, I was stationed in Djibouti, Africa, helping provide security for a U.S. base. In my free time, I explored Djibouti City and volunteered at orphanages. Here, shoes were a luxury and infectious diseases, like HIV, were commonplace. It was heart-wrenching to see the contrast to our medical system and how their limited resources adversely affected the people of Djibouti. In the orphanages, illnesses such as diarrhea were common and not all children recovered, especially infants. These experiences helped steer me toward medicine and advocacy.

I became interested in RESULTS, a nonpartisan citizens lobby to end poverty, and learned how Gavi's work directly benefits children similar to those in the Djiboutian orphanages. The work they do is inspiring. Although I am not yet able to provide medical care, I feel by helping raise awareness of Gavi I am improving the health and well-being of children like the ones in Djibouti.

Gavi is an international, public/private partnership; it is a vaccination program that supports low-income countries in delivering vaccines to the poorest of children. Since 2002, Gavi has increased access to vaccines, saving 6 million lives. Now Gavi has a plan to immunize 300 million more children by 2020, thereby saving 5 million more lives. Gavi not only provides vaccinations but makes a lasting impact on the poorest of communities.

Because of Gavi's help in building routine vaccination systems in these communities, more than 20 countries are projected to graduate from Gavi financing altogether by 2020. This means they will be providing vaccinations and vaccination delivery to their own citizens without outside help because of the foundation built by Gavi. The low-income countries for which the vaccines are provided must match a portion of the cost of each vaccine supported by Gavi, and that share increases as their economy grows. By 2020, the projected shared cost by donors such as the United States is expected to decrease from 80 percent of the total to less than 60 percent.

Gavi will hold a funding replenishment conference in January in Berlin. President Barack Obama has made a personal commitment to helping end preventable child deaths, and we ask him to fulfill that promise at this conference by pledging $250 million a year for four years. This is in line with other donor nations, within our means, and keeps us integral to Gavi's success. We must ensure that whether a child lives or dies does not depend on where that child lives.

The role of a physician is simple but sacred: We are responsible for healing. As doctors, it is our responsibility to advocate for those in dire need of medical services and to provide insight on ways to help others. This goal is aligned with the work of RESULTS and Gavi to give the chance of a healthy life to millions of children worldwide.

Every child deserves a fifth birthday.

Dr. Robyn Schickler is a graduate of the USF Morsani College of Medicine and a resident at Tampa General Hospital. Jerry Trotter is a first-year student at the USF Morsani College of Medicine.

The couple converted their civil bond under new laws implemented in England earlier this year that allow same-sex marriages.

On Sunday the couple posted an Instagram picture of themselves preparing to sign official documents.

""That’s the legal bit done. Now on to the ceremony!"" they wrote.

John and Furnish planned a celebration at their estate near Windsor Castle west of London. An A-list crowd was expected — even if the festivities were likely to be much more sedate than the parties in John’s hell-raising rock 'n’ roll days.

The singer — known for an impressive string of hits dating back decades — promised to post pictures of the festivities to fans around the world.

The nuptials came as no surprise: John had tweeted about his plans earlier in the week, and earlier in the year had praised England for embracing same-sex marriage. He said there had been a remarkable change in a country where homosexual acts had long been deemed criminal offenses.

John said the wedding would be a joyous occasion shared with the couple’s two sons, Zachary and Elijah.

The menu was traditional and posh, featuring wild mushroom soup with truffle cream, beef short rib with caramelized onion pie and warm chocolate pudding with vanilla ice cream for dessert, according to a photo of the menu posted by Brooklyn Beckham, son of soccer start David Beckham and designer Victoria Beckham.

The champagne was Laurent-Perrier.

In his post, Brooklyn Beckham offered congratulations to ""Uncle Elton and Uncle David.""

John said earlier this year that he and Furnish planned to take advantage of the changes to the law, even though they already had a civil bond recognized by the courts.

""We shouldn’t just say, 'Oh well, we have a civil partnership, we’re not going to bother to get married,"" he said.

Tampa Bay Times,Humana agrees to cut costs of HIV drugs for Florida patients,"The third of four Florida insurers accused of overcharging HIV and AIDS patients for their medications has agreed to take steps to reduce those costs, advocacy groups announced Friday.

Humana signed an agreement with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation agreeing to reduce patient cost-sharing for all HIV drugs on the 2015 plans it sells on the federal marketplace in Florida.

Florida officials began investigating after two advocacy groups — the AIDS Institute based on Davis Islands in Tampa and the National Health Law Program — filed a federal complaint alleging four insurance companies had discriminated against HIV and AIDS patients.

The complaint said the insurers' popular ""silver"" plans sold through the marketplace are designed so that routine medications for HIV/AIDS patients come with the greatest out-of-pocket costs.

The insurers named in the complaint were Cigna, Humana, Coventry Health Care and Preferred Medical.

As part of the new agreement with the state, Humana will lower patient cost-sharing of HIV drugs from 50 to 10 percent co-insurance for the more costly HIV medications. For HIV drugs that are less than $600, Humana will lower the cost to patients from 50 percent co-insurance to a $50 co-pay.

State officials have reached separate agreements with Cigna and Coventry. In both of those agreements, the insurers agreed to limit patient cost-sharing for only four HIV drugs. The agreement with Humana affects all HIV drugs, the AIDS Institute said in a news release.

""This agreement will help ensure that people living with HIV/AIDS will have greater access to essential medicines in Florida at a more affordable cost,"" said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director for The AIDS Institute. ""However, much work needs to be done.""",19/12/2014
Tampa Bay Times,FDA panel wary of lifting ban on gay blood donors,"Government health advisers have concerns about lifting the nation's 31-year-old ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men, despite growing pressure from gay rights advocates, medical experts and blood banks.

The ban dates from the first years of the AIDS crisis and was intended to protect the U.S. blood supply from exposure to the little-understood disease. But many medical groups, including the American Medical Association, say the policy is no longer supported by science, given advances in HIV testing. And gay activists say the lifetime ban is discriminatory and perpetuates negative stereotypes against homosexual men.

Despite such concerns, blood safety experts on Tuesday urged the Food and Drug Administration to exercise caution in making any changes to current policy, saying the impact on the blood supply is difficult to predict. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisers. The agency has not set a timeline for making any changes to current donor standards.

The hesitancy voiced by the FDA's advisers is out of step with other parts of the federal government, which have been moving toward reconsidering the policy.

Last month a separate panel of blood safety experts convened by the Department of Health and Human Services voted 16-2 in favor of doing away with the ban on donations from gay and bisexual men. The same experts previously voted to uphold the ban in 2010, but said new research shows that the safety of the blood supply would not be compromised by revising the donation policy.

The panel recommended moving to a one-year deferral period, which would bar male donors who have had sex with men in the previous 12 months.

But the FDA's experts did not overwhelmingly embrace that proposal.

Tampa Bay Times,Hyde Park pastor prepares message on troubles facing mankind,"For the Rev. Roger Scholtz, interim pastor at Hyde Park United Methodist Church in Tampa, the meaning of the holidays stretches beyond live nativities and sparkling lights.

Scholtz, who came to the church from South Africa, says the story of Jesus Christ's birth offers unyielding hope to a troubled world.

Beginning Sunday, Scholtz will offer ""Take Heart,"" a four-week Advent worship series focused on the major issues mankind faces today. Scholtz will offer a Christ-centered world view on subjects ranging from Ebola to school shootings at 8:30, 9:30 and 11 a.m. services.

I spoke to Scholtz about the series and his take on the holidays.

What subjects will you cover during the ""Take Heart"" sermon series?

Hope in a world of disease is the first topic. I will talk about the continued spread of HIV/AIDS, the hysteria around Ebola, the prevalence of cancer and the conspiracy of silence around depression. All are clear indications of the deep need for real and robust hope in the face of disease.

On Dec. 7, I will address peace in a world of violence. The recent shooting at FSU is just the latest in a long list of tragic incidents in this gun-crazed culture. In the light of these violent realities, the promise of peace is not just a naive and wishful fantasy.

The third week will be about joy in a world of inequality. The commercialization of Christmas makes all of us susceptible to the material excesses of this season. It's easy to spend too much, eat and drink too much, and generally consume too much at this time of year, which invariably leaves us feeling empty and dissatisfied, especially when we remember the many people, both locally and around the world, who have only a fraction of what we do. In contrast to this, the gift of true joy is offered to all who are willing to let go of the clutter of the season.

On Dec. 21, the message will be love in a world of brokenness. For many, Christmas can be an emotionally charged time as they are confronted with the painful truth of broken relationships, broken promises and broken dreams in their lives. Finding the courage to risk loving again can bring healing and wholeness.

Why is it important to remind people of the hope Jesus brings during the season?

It is so easy to get overwhelmed, distracted and thoroughly exhausted in the rush of the Christmas season. Every year we promise ourselves that this year it's going to be different, but we find ourselves tripping up over the same old habits and patterns again and again. If we really paid attention, we'd recognize that this is a clear indication of our need for help, not just for this time of year but for the entirety of our lives. The hope that Jesus brings is the promise of the help we most need.

In your experiences around the world what has struck you most about the potential healing power of Jesus?

No matter who we are, where we come from or what we do, from a high-powered corporate executive in Tampa to a grandmother in an informal settlement in South Africa trying to provide for her hungry grandchildren, all of us share a deep need for our intrinsic humanity to be recognized and expressed. The great gift of Jesus is that he has shown us what it means to be fully human, to be fully alive.

How have your personal life experiences shaped your faith?

While every life experience has faith-shaping potential, I'd say that it's been my experiences of failure, disappointment and injustice that have taught me most about the unconditional love of God and what it means to be held in that love. When the hard knocks of life, for example, the painful divorce I went through some years back, expose our attachment to incidental ideas of who we are, the gracious invitation is extended for us to be reminded of our deepest identity as beloved children made in the image of God.

What advice do you offer those in difficult times this holiday season?

I'd simply want to acknowledge that difficult times are especially difficult at this time of year, precisely because the prevailing culture places such a high premium on being upbeat and happy, and also because the pain of loss is felt more keenly in this season. I'd encourage them to find some way in which they could offer themselves in meaningful service to someone else. That might be the very last thing that they feel like doing, but something begins to happen when we see that our individual stories, with all their pain and struggle, are part of a bigger story. Service to others can help us to see that. Churches and charitable organizations, like Metropolitan Ministries, can be helpful places to offer such service. I'd encourage them to open themselves this season to the response of faith. Attend a church service. Speak to someone they trust about God. Let their prayers and the cries of their hearts pour out to God. And listen. Really listen. For hidden in a baby's cry from a stable in Bethlehem that continues to echo across the ages is the greatest news ever told: ""You are not alone.""",28/11/2014
Tampa Bay Times,Dunedin couple allowed to bring adopted son out of Congo,"DUNEDIN — A Dunedin couple have succeeded in their fight to bring home their dying adopted son from the Democratic Republic of Congo, say advocates who have been assisting them.

Ten-month-old Cruz is among hundreds of legally adopted Congolese children barred from leaving the African country because of a September 2013 moratorium on exit permits surrounding international adoptions.

The implications are dire for about 30 children, like Cruz, who are critically ill and in need of immediate medical attention.

In October, his adoptive mom, Andrea Stewart, traveled to Congo to plead with officials in person for a medical exception.

Nearly four weeks later, officials deemed Cruz and 10 other children certified by three Congolese physicians to be so ill that they need to be evacuated to the United States for treatment unavailable there. Their ailments include HIV, heart and lung defects, and seizure disorders.

On Thursday, Cruz, whose rare respiratory disease is expected to kill him unless he receives heart and lung transplants within six months, became the third to receive an exit letter. United States government officials are pushing Congolese leaders to issue the remainder and to examine 18 additional sick children.

Advocates say Congo's reason for the exit ban has repeatedly shifted from concerns about the welfare of adoptees in foreign countries to worries about the integrity of its own adoption system and more.

""The real obstacle has been getting the medical assessments done, because adoption is such a political issue in that country right now,"" said Kelly Dempsey, general counsel for Both Ends Burning, a nonprofit rallying to assist the children and their families. ""It's hard to find physicians who are willing to examine these children and prepare reports.""

Mother and child are scheduled to arrive at Tampa International Airport this evening — sparing Andrea, her husband, Chris, and their three young biological children from plans to uproot and move to Congo.

""We are beyond blessed with the honor of being Cruz's family. For now, we will focus on his health and where the next steps take us into caring for orphans around the world,"" the couple said in a statement released through U.S. Rep. David Jolly's office.

Dempsey said a medical team is in place to immediately admit Cruz to a hospital as soon as he touches American soil.

""For Cruz, this will mean the difference between life and death,"" she said. ""Andrea's fondest wish was to be home and with Cruz in the hospital for Thanksgiving, and I think she's going to get that wish. I am just thrilled for them.""

Meanwhile, Dempsey said her group, as well as federal authorities, remain on the case: ""As wonderful as this is for Cruz and the Stewarts, I know they will continue to fight for those kids too, because there are hundreds more waiting.""",21/11/2014
Tampa Bay Times,Wikipedia search data is used in flu research,"Can public health experts tell that an infectious disease outbreak is imminent simply by looking at what people are searching for on Wikipedia? Yes, at least in some cases.

Researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory were able to make extremely accurate forecasts about the spread of dengue fever in Brazil and flu in the United States, Japan, Poland and Thailand by examining three years' worth of Wikipedia search data. They also came up with moderately successful predictions of tuberculosis outbreaks in Thailand and China, and of dengue fever's spread in Thailand.

However, their efforts to anticipate cases of cholera, Ebola and HIV by extrapolating from search data left much to be desired, according to a report published Thursday in the journal PLOS Computational Biology. But the researchers think their general approach could still work if they use more sophisticated statistics and a more inclusive data set.

Accurate data on the spread of infectious diseases can be culled from a variety of sources. Government agencies typically get it from patient interviews and laboratory test results. Other data sources include calls to 911 lines, emergency room admissions and absences from work or school.

The problem with these methods is that they can be time-consuming and costly. By the time the numbers are crunched, an outbreak may be in full swing.

If you want to stop an outbreak before it starts, what you need is a forecast that is both accurate and timely. And so the Los Alamos researchers turned to the treasure trove that is Wikipedia.

In addition to the about 30 million articles on topics ranging from quantum foam to the First English Civil War to Kim Kardashian, Wikipedia also collects data on the approximately 850 million search requests it gets each day. In previous studies, researchers have used this publicly available data to predict ticket sales for new movies and the movement of stock prices.

When it comes to health, people have found correlations between interest in certain health topics on Wikipedia and sales of medications. Others have linked searches for flu-related topics by American Wikipedia users to actual flu spread in the United States.

Five members of the LANL's Defense Systems and Analysis Division thought they could do more. Their goal was to get a read on current and future trends not just for flu in the United States, but for several diseases in several countries. Ideally, they hoped to come up with a model that could be ""trained"" with data from a place where it's available and then applied to another place where it wasn't.",17/11/2014
Tampa Bay Times,Editorial: Florida Legislature should approve medical marijuana,"While a constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana in Florida fell just short of the 60 percent approval needed to pass, more than half of the voters supported it. The Legislature should take the hint and craft responsible medical marijuana legislation before its supporters push the issue back onto the ballot. Writing a narrowly tailored state law that can be easily adjusted would be more responsible than forcing this complicated issue into the Florida Constitution.

Voters did the right thing Tuesday by rejecting an amendment that was too broadly written and ripe for exploitation and lawsuits. Amendment 2 would have allowed doctors to recommend marijuana to patients with debilitating conditions including cancer, glaucoma, HIV or multiple sclerosis. Qualifying patients would have had to secure a patient ID card from the Department of Health and pick up medical marijuana from state-regulated dispensaries. The amendment also provided civil and criminal immunity for doctors, patients, caregivers and dispensaries engaged in the lawful use or distribution of medical marijuana.

The Legislature should concentrate on the three issues that were most problematic with Amendment 2. First, lawmakers should clearly define and list the conditions that can be treated by medical marijuana. There should be no room for doctors' interpretations such as the ""other conditions"" language used in Amendment 2. Lawmakers also should develop a procedure for adding to the list of treatable medical conditions in the future. Clarifying these issues would help prevent abuse by patients and physicians.

Second, the Legislature should write strict rules for caregivers and limit the role to people without criminal backgrounds.

Finally, lawmakers must address the issue of criminal and civil liability. During the Amendment 2 campaign, there was broad disagreement from both sides about exactly what civil and criminal immunity meant for recommending doctors, patients, caregivers and dispensaries. Lawmakers should sort it out.

Though it failed to win the 60 percent required for approval, Amendment 2 got more votes — more than 3.3 million or 57 percent — than any of the candidates for governor and Cabinet. It is clear that a significant majority of voters want to see marijuana for medical use legalized in the state. Legislators should step up before Amendment 2 supporters try to revive their efforts in 2016.

Improbably, the Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill earlier this year that allows for a non-euphoric strain of marijuana to be used by children with epileptic seizures. Lawmakers should build on that law to allow medical marijuana use for all patients who qualify with specific illnesses.

Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have now legalized some form of medical marijuana. Most have done so by legislative statute. The paths some of those states followed can serve as road maps for Florida lawmakers. Legislators have acted with compassion regarding marijuana for medical use before, and they should do it again next spring.",05/11/2014
