The New York Times,HIV Phobia,"A psychological condition, reported in China, whereby individuals are convinced they have HIV despite negative test results.

“Hundreds of people in China believe they might have a new disease with HIV-like symptoms, but doctors suggest their illness could be the result of a mental rather than a physical condition,” Chris Hogg reported for the BBC.

The Chinese authorities have been accused of covering up respiratory illnesses like Sars in the past.

This time doctors are blaming a breakdown in trust between the medical profession and patients, who fear they are being lied to when their diagnostic tests come back negative.

Hogg interviewed Dr Cai Weiping, a senior Chinese HIV researcher at the People’s Number 8 hospital in Guangdong:

[Dr Cai] is concerned that growing numbers of patients with what he describes as “HIV phobia” are using up scarce resources.

“They come to have tests again and again, wasting money.

“A real HIV sufferer may take 15 minutes to deal with. A patient with the phobia can take at least an hour, or as much as half a day of arguing before they go away.” …

He believes the problem is psychological rather than physical.

“They think we are concealing an epidemic,” he explains.",18/02/2010
The New York Times,"On Hollywood, HIV, Alcohol and Warming","David Roberts has posted an interesting Grist interview with Sandra de Castro Buffington, who directs the Hollywood, Health and Society program at the University of Southern California.

The program, in collaboration with several federal health agencies, works behind the scenes in Hollywood to foster smarter public health choices by, among other things, shaping story lines in scripts for TV shows and movies. One example was the “Hammered” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which focused on alcohol abuse:

.

In the Grist piece, Buffington talks enthusiastically about doing for human-driven global warming what’s been done for HIV awareness, diabetes, alcoholism and the like. (This is not entirely new terrain, mind you; the Environmental Media Association began doing the same thing starting in the late 1980s.)

I could see storytelling, particularly melding images and ideas, bringing a fresh focus to the scope of the country’s, and world’s, energy gap. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t repeatedly post the photo of kids doing homework under parking lot lights in Guinea (and more recently the hopeful photos of kids in rural Kenya doing the same thing at home because of a small solar panel).

But I’m deeply doubtful that this is a path to changing public attitudes and — more importantly — behaviors related to curbing emissions of greenhouse gases. There’s simply too much evidence that the fundamental characteristics of the rising human influence on climate are a very bad fit for how humans absorb and respond to risks.

I’d be happy to be proved wrong, and others have different views, of course. I sent a query on the Grist post to a variety of analysts and practitioners involved in testing how different ways of presenting information might, or might not, influence people’s attitudes and, more importantly, choices. [ Matthew Nisbet has posted an excellent analysis of such efforts at Age of Engagement.]

I’m priming the comment string below with their reactions. Please add yours.",27/01/2011
The New York Times,Developer of HIV Drugs Raises $31 Million,"Tobira Therapeutics, a new company developing a pair of HIV drugs, raised $31 million in a first round of funding led by Domain Associates. Other investors who threw in included Frazier Healthcare Ventures, Montreux Equity Partners, and Canaan Partners.

Domain partner Eckard Weber founded Tobira last year to develop drugs licensed from Takeda Pharmaceutical of Osaka, Japan.

The New York Times,"Weeks After 2030 HIV Pledge, Report Shows US Headway Stalled","The new numbers show the government fell well short of previously set goals for reducing the spread of HIV by 2015, noted Dr. David Holtgrave, a longtime HIV expert who is dean of public health at the State University of New York at Albany.

What does it say about the 2030 goal? CDC officials said there's reason to be optimistic, but Holtgrave said the new report and other data do not bode well.

Barring new government funding of at least several billion dollars a year, ""it's extremely unlikely that will occur,"" Holtgrave said.

The report found:

—An estimated 38,700 new HIV infections occurred in the United States in 2016.

—Nearly 20,000 of those 2016 infections happened in the South. That's more than the combined total for the rest of the country.

—New infections have been dropping among many groups of people, including black women, those younger than 24 and gay white men.

—But there's no longer a decline in infections among people who inject drugs; it stopped declining in 2012. Experts believe the nation's opioid epidemic is to blame.

—Infections are rising among black and Latino gay men who are ages 25 to 34. That number grew 65 percent from 2010 to 2016, offsetting decreases in other groups.

During his State of the Union speech earlier this month, Trump said he was launching a campaign to end HIV in the U.S. by 2030. Separately, federal health officials said the government hopes to reduce new infections by 90 percent over the next 10 years. The president did not say how much new money will be spent on the effort.",27/02/2019
The New York Times,Monthly Shots Control HIV as Well as Pills in 2 Big Studies,"SEATTLE — Monthly shots of HIV drugs worked as well as daily pills to control the virus that causes AIDS in two large international tests, researchers reported Thursday.

If approved by regulators in the United States and Europe, the shots would be a new option for people with HIV and could help some stay on treatment. Instead of having to remember to take pills, patients instead could get injections from a doctor or nurse each month.

""Some people will be thrilled"" at the convenience, said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an AIDS advocacy group.

Condoms remain the most widely available and inexpensive form of HIV prevention. Pills taken daily can keep HIV levels so low the virus is not transmittable to sex partners, but not everyone takes them as prescribed.",07/03/2019
The New York Times,Kentucky Man Accused of Singapore HIV Data Leak Jailed in US,"LEXINGTON, Ky. — A Kentucky man accused by the Singapore government of stealing a database of HIV patients has been jailed in the U.S. on federal charges of illegally possessing Singaporean identification documents.

Mikhy Farrera-Brochez of Winchester was briefly in federal court in Lexington on Wednesday. A federal grand jury will meet to decide if Brochez should be indicted on four U.S. charges related to the possession of the documents.

Last month, Singapore's health ministry accused Brochez of stealing and leaking a pre-2013 database of 14,200 people who were infected with HIV. The ministry says Brochez worked in Singapore as a lecturer before he was jailed for several drug and fraud-related offenses and deported last year.

Brochez's attorney, Jay Oakley, said Wednesday that Brochez is innocent of the charges.

""The nature of the charges are that he has in his possession certain identifying government documents coming from Singapore and that he shouldn't have in his possession,"" Oakley said after the court hearing. ""We're going to prepare our defense and handle the charges as they need to be handled.""",27/02/2019
The New York Times,"HIV Deaths Fall Below 1,000","Deaths from HIV in New York City fell below 1,000 in 2009 for the first time since the disease exploded in the 1980’s, the city health department announced today.

In 1994, at the disease’s peak, there were 7,046 deaths from HIV in the city; in 2008, there were 1,073. In 2009, there were 933, down 13 percent from 2008 and down 87 percent from 1994.

Infant mortality in the city also fell to an all-time low in 2009, to 5.3 deaths per thousand live births, down from 5.5 in 2008, the health department said. That is significantly lower than the national infant mortality rate of about 6 deaths per thousand live births.

In general, in fact, people in New York City just aren’t dying the way they used to. The death rate in the city fell to an all-time low in 2009, and the average New Yorker’s life expectancy held steady at 82 years for women and 76.3 for men. These statistics and many more are available in the health department’s Annual Summary of Vital Statistics, released today, which covers 2009, not 2010, because there is a lag in compiling the data.

Other findings: Deaths attributable to smoking also declined, as did deaths from heart disease and influenza, while deaths from cancer and diabetes ticked up slightly.",29/12/2010
The New York Times,London Man Seems to Be Free of HIV in Second Such Case,"SEATTLE — A London man appears to be free of the virus that causes AIDS after a stem cell transplant, the second success including the ""Berlin patient,"" doctors reported.

The therapy had an early success with Timothy Ray Brown, a U.S. man treated in Germany who is 12 years post-transplant and still free of HIV. Until now, Brown is the only person thought to have been cured of infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Such transplants are dangerous and have failed in other patients. They're also impractical to try to cure the millions already infected.

The latest case ""shows the cure of Timothy Brown was not a fluke and can be recreated,"" said Dr. Keith Jerome of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who had no role. He added that it could lead to a simpler approach that could be used more widely.",04/03/2019
The New York Times,London HIV Patient Becomes World's Second AIDS Cure Hope,"LONDON, March 4 — An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV-resistant donor, his doctors said.

Almost three years after he received bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after he came off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the man's previous HIV infection.

""There is no virus there that we can measure. We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure, but does not mean that cure has already been found.",05/03/2019
The New York Times,"LeRoy Whitfield, 36, Dies; Wrote of AIDS Battle","LeRoy Whitfield, a journalist who used a magazine column to chronicle the everyday struggles of people with H.I.V., died last Sunday at North General Hospital in Harlem. He was 36.

The cause was AIDS-related complications, said his brother, Crofton Whitfield.

Mr. Whitfield had written a column titled ""Native Tongue"" since May 2004 in HIV Plus, a national magazine distributed at doctors' offices and organizations offering services for people with AIDS. The magazine's editor, Michael W.E. Edwards, said that Mr. Whitfield's column was one of the magazine's most popular features because of the candor with which he shared his own fight against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Mr. Whitfield learned that he was H.I.V.-positive when he was 19, and he decided to forgo taking the powerful AIDS drugs that have extended the lives of many people with H.I.V. It was a choice that he stood by till the end, even though his doctors advised him to take the medicines, his brother said.

Mr. Whitfield was also a frequent contributor to Vibe magazine and a former senior editor at Poz, another magazine intended for people with H.I.V.

LeRoy Whitfield was born in Chicago on Sept. 19, 1969. In addition to his brother, he is survived by a sister, LaRonya Whitfield.",16/10/2005
The New York Times,Health Group Retracts Report on H.I.V. in Greece,"On Tuesday morning, Ms. Porritt told The Times that the W.H.O. report should have said that “about half of infections are due to needle injection, some of which is deliberate self-infection.”

It was not clear, though, whether there was evidence to say even that much. The various reports included no apparent documentation of any cases.

By Tuesday afternoon, the W.H.O. had issued its own correction: “The sentence should read: ‘Half of the new H.I.V. cases are self-injecting, and out of them, few are deliberately inflicting the virus.’ ” Later in the day, it retracted that statement, too, and said instead, “There is no evidence suggesting that deliberate self-infection with H.I.V. goes beyond a few anecdotal cases.”

The Greek H.I.V. claim did not receive much attention when the report first came out, though it was mentioned in an article late October on the website of the magazine New Scientist. But the claim gained traction quickly Monday on Twitter, and it was reposted by European journalists and politicians.

A Sky News headline said “Greeks ‘Injecting HIV to Claim €700 Benefits’ ,” while a Fox Business headline said “European Crisis: Half of HIV Infections in Greece Are Self-Inflicted.”

Not all accepted it at face value, however. Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group, wrote online Monday that “the W.H.O. report is incorrect,” after studying the citation.

What is not in dispute is that while Greece saw a sharp rise in cases of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, with the onset of its economic crisis, the latest government figures show the number of new cases falling this year.",27/11/2013
The New York Times,United States Charges Man Accused in Leak of Singapore HIV Data,"SINGAPORE — Authorities in the United States have charged a man accused of leaking information on thousands of HIV victims in Singapore with possession and unlawful transfer of stolen documents.

Mikhy Farrera-Brochez was deported last year from the wealthy Asian city state after serving a prison sentence for numerous drug-related and fraud offences, including lying about his own HIV status.

In January, Singapore's health ministry said Brochez had disclosed online the personal information, from names and identity numbers to addresses, of 5,400 citizens diagnosed with HIV up to January 2013, and of 8,800 foreigners diagnosed up to December 2011.

The New York Times,HIV in the Mountain Kingdom,"Ben Solomon for The New York Times

Jordan Schermerhorn, a recent graduate of Rice University, is the 2012 “Win A Trip” winner. She is currently traveling with Nick through parts of southern Africa. In her first post, she writes about HIV treatment in Lesotho.

For my first trip outside of the United States, I felt amply prepared for new experiences traveling across southern Africa – for witnessing both the struggles of poverty and the optimism of burgeoning economic growth.

Then I saw the plane.

Suppressing nervousness, I scrambled into the tiny six-seat propeller plane that bore us on the first leg of our journey to a health clinic. It looked hardly bigger than a toy, and each of us was weighed before stepping inside so the pilot could calculate the amount of fuel necessary. The plane was to take us to the small village of Bobete, near the center of the southern African country of Lesotho. This country is aptly named the Mountain Kingdom: immense geographical barriers limit the construction of roads and airstrips used to reach patients in remote, rural villages, and our bird’s eye view provided some insight into the complexity of delivering health care in Lesotho. Health centers in the distant reaches of the country are often swarmed with patients, many of whom are unable to trek to the clinics in snow storms. Such weather also poses immense difficulties for planes attempting to drop off supplies: for instance, the clinic we visited was out of injectable contraceptives.



As we made our approach, buildings trimmed in bright red – characteristic, I later learned, of all health facilities in Lesotho – stood out sharply against grain-covered slopes. I was thrilled to spot solar panels on the periphery of the clinic. Along with a backup generator, this reliable power source allows the clinic to operate independently of regular blackouts that plague similar areas, keeping X-ray and ultrasound machines running for patients in need.

The Bobete clinic, an outpost tucked away in the mountains, is run by Partners in Health, the organization founded by Dr. Paul Farmer and best known for its work in Haiti. The clinic is used primarily to treat HIV patients in a catchment area of 30,000 people. In Lesotho, 23% of the adult population is HIV positive – most of them women of childbearing age – and treatment is undergoing a transformation. With a HIV diagnosis no longer considered an immediate death sentence, the stigma surrounding the disease here is vastly reduced.

One HIV-positive woman we spoke to said she was not scared when her test results first came back: she knew what HIV was, and that it was manageable with medication. After a few weeks of antiretrovirals, she felt well enough to head to the capital city of Maseru in search of a job – only to catch tuberculosis four months later. Though she was forced to retreat to the clinic that had first saved her life, she soon expects to be back in her healthiest state. Unfortunately, this cycle of concurrent infectious and chronic disease is not uncommon: HIV patients may catch tuberculosis time and time again.

It helps immensely that antiretroviral drugs are available for free here, but the question remains as to whether or not that will be sustainable as people with HIV live longer. Prevention is becoming increasingly important, and one of the most essential paths to eradication of the epidemic is the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Pregnant women arriving at the Bobete clinic are HIV tested as a matter of course, and those who test positive are provided with a substantial support system to ensure their children are borne free of the virus.

We met another HIV-positive woman with a toddler whose squirming could not be suppressed even when strapped tightly to her back under a blanket. She had followed careful protocol while pregnant, diligently boiling water and cleaning bottles when opting to exclusively formula-feed her son. Though her mother had eight children, she says this one is quite enough for her; though she halted her education after two years of secondary school, she dreams of sending her son to university. This is the progress Lesotho can hope for in the next generation of the fight against HIV and AIDS: with effective prevention techniques, an educated population, and an expanding health system, all toddlers should be so lucky.

And, yes, the visit to the clinic was worth a bumpy flight in a tiny airplane. I even got to ride in the co-pilot’s seat on the way back for a free flying lesson.",28/06/2012
The New York Times,"Gene Variation May Raise Risk of H.I.V., Study Finds","A genetic variation that once protected people in sub-Saharan Africa from a now extinct form of malaria may have left them somewhat more vulnerable to infection by H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The gene could account for 11 percent of the H.I.V. infections in Africa, explaining why the disease is more common there than expected, researchers based in Texas and London say. The researchers said their finding had no immediate public health consequences. But if confirmed, it would offer an important insight into the biology of the virus.

The genetic variation has been studied in United States Air Force personnel, whose H.I.V. infections have been followed for 25 years. African-Americans who carried the variation were 50 percent more likely to acquire H.I.V. than African-Americans who did not, although their disease progressed more slowly, say researchers led by Sunil K. Ahuja, director of the Veterans Administration H.I.V./AIDS Center, San Antonio, and Matthew J. Dolan of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md. Their results were reported Wednesday in the journal Cell Host & Microbe.

David B. Goldstein, geneticist who studies H.I.V. at Duke University, said that the new result “would be pretty exciting if it holds up” and that many other researchers would now test it. “If the results are confirmed, it would mean that selection for resistance to malaria has created a vulnerability to infection with HIV-1,” he said, referring to the principal form of the virus.

The genetic variation, called a SNP, or snip, involves a change in one unit of DNA. This particular snip has a far-reaching consequence. It prevents red blood cells from inserting a certain protein on their surface. The protein is called a receptor because it receives signals from a hormone known as CCL5, which is part of the immune system’s regulatory system.

The receptor is also used by a malarial parasite called Plasmodium vivax to gain entry to the red blood cells it feeds on. About 10,000 years ago, people in Africa who possessed the SNP variation gained a powerful survival advantage from not being vulnerable to the ancestor of Plasmodium vivax. The SNP eventually swept through the population and the vivax parasite died out in Africa, to be replaced by its current successor, Plasmodium falciparum.",17/07/2008
The New York Times,Scientists Urge New Look at Feeding in AIDS Fight,"Many governments in poor countries have followed those guidelines, even encouraging infected mothers to stop breast-feeding earlier than six months in an effort to reduce the risk of transmitting H.I.V. to infants.

But four new studies conducted in Africa and reported on Monday showed that there could be significant dangers for such formula-fed infants.

Three studies found that many uninfected infants who were breast-fed exclusively by their infected mothers and weaned rapidly at six months had increased rates of severe diarrhea resulting in hospitalization or death.

A fourth study uncovered an epidemic of diarrhea and malnutrition that occurred among young children after a flood last year in Botswana. Because of sewage contamination of the water and the environment, deaths from diarrhea in the South African country were 25 times higher than in earlier years. The link between the outbreak and formula-feeding was found only through a detailed epidemiological study.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta paid for these four studies.

Dr. Michael Thigpen, a C.D.C. epidemiologist who reported one of the studies, said that while the overall findings were disturbing, they were part of continuing studies. Changing official recommendations should wait for completion of the studies, Dr. Thigpen said.

A fifth study, from Zambia, showed an increased death rate among infants born to infected mothers who stopped breast-feeding at four months.

Dr. Moses Sinkala of the Lusaka District Health Management team, who presented the Zambian study, said the study cautioned against stopping breast-feeding early in poor countries.

Dr. Sinkala said health officials “should strongly encourage breast-feeding into the second year of life for infants found to be HIV-infected.” The reason was that infected infants had a lower death rate the longer they were breast-fed, said Dr. Donald M. Thea of Boston University, a co-author of the Zambian study.

In a main address to the conference, Dr. Hoosen Coovadia, an AIDS expert from Durban, South Africa, pointed out the many well-documented advantages of breast-feeding. Dr. Coovadia pleaded with pediatricians and health officials not to lose sight of the fact that breast-feeding provided one of nature’s greatest health benefits.

Dr. Coovadia, who works at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, cited data from two United Nations agencies that showed a large difference in deaths among breast-fed infants. The data were from mathematical modeling studies.

United Nations AIDS estimates that 300,000 infants die each year from becoming infected through breast-feeding. Unicef estimates that 1.5 million infants die each year from mothers who avoided breast-feeding.

Preventing H.I.V. infection would be the definitive way to avoid the issue, Dr. Coovadia said. But for those at risk, health officials need to provide antiretroviral therapy to mothers and children, and scientists need to determine whether a vaccine now being tested among children in Africa may reduce their risk of getting H.I.V. from an infected mother.",27/02/2007
The New York Times,"Circumcision Reduces Risk of AIDS, Study Finds","Sex education messages to young men need to make it clear that “this does not mean that you have an absolute protection,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an AIDS researcher and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsored the trials. Circumcision should be added to other prevention methods, not replace them, he said.

The two trials were carried out among nearly 3,000 men in Kisumu, Kenya, and nearly 5,000 men in Rakai, Uganda. None were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS; they were divided into circumcised and uncircumcised groups. They were given safe sex advice — although many presumably did not take it — and retested regularly.

The trials were stopped by the National Institutes of Health’s Data Safety and Monitoring Board this week after data showed that the Kenyan men had a 53 percent reduction in new H.I.V. cases and the Ugandan men a 48 percent reduction.

In Kenya, 22 of the 1,393 circumcised young men in the study caught the disease, compared with 47 of the 1,391 uncircumcised men.

Those results echo the finding of a trial completed last year in the town of Orange Farm, South Africa, financed by the French government, which demonstrated a reduction of 60 percent among circumcised men.

Two agencies, one under the State Department and the other financed by a number of countries, said they now would be willing to pay for circumcisions, which they have not before, citing a lack of hard evidence that it works.

Dr. Richard G. A. Feachem, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said that if a country seeking money submitted plans to conduct safe, sterile circumcisions, “I think it’s very likely that our technical panel would approve it.”

Ambassador Mark Dybul, executive director of the $15 billion President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in the State Department, said his agency “will support implementation of safe medical male circumcision for HIV/AIDS prevention.”

He too warned that it was only one new weapon.

“Prevention efforts must reinforce the ABC approach — abstain, be faithful and correct and consistent use of condoms,” he said.

Uncircumcised men are thought to be more susceptible to AIDS because the underside of the foreskin is rich in Langerhans’ cells, which attach easily to the virus. The foreskin may also suffer small tears during intercourse, making it more susceptible to infection.

Researchers have long noted that parts of Africa where circumcision is practiced — particularly in the Muslim countries of West Africa — had much lower AIDS rates. But it was unclear whether other factors, such as religion or polygamy, played important roles.

Outside Muslim regions, circumcision is spotty. In South Africa, for example, the Xhosa people circumcise teen-age boys, while Zulus, whose traditional homeland abuts theirs, do not. AIDS is common in members of both tribes.

In recent years, as word has spread that circumcision might be protective, many African men have sought it out. A Zambian hospital offered $3 circumcisions last year, and Swaziland trained 60 doctors to give them at $40 each after its waiting lists grew.

“Private practitioners also do it,” Dr. Halperin said. “In some places, it’s $20, in others, much more. Lots of the wealthy elite have already done it. It prevents STD’s, it’s seen as cleaner, sex is better, women like it. I predict that a lot of men who can’t afford private clinics will start clamoring for it.”",13/12/2006
The New York Times,BOOKS ON HEALTH; Women And H.I.V.,"''A Woman's Guide to Living with H.I.V. Infection,'' by Dr. Rebecca A. Clark, Dr. Robert T. Maupin Jr. and Dr. Jill Hayes Hammer. Johns Hopkins University Press, $15.95.

Early in the AIDS epidemic, men were thought to be at higher risk for the disease. Today, about half the adults living with H.I.V. or AIDS worldwide are women. In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 12,000 women are infected every year, 30 percent of all new cases.

The authors, experts based in New Orleans, deal with the concerns of women with H.I.V., a topic they feel has not been addressed adequately, especially when it comes to gynecologic disorders, reproductive choices, contraception and pregnancy. Covering the medical, emotional and social issues facing women with H.I.V. infection, the authors' approach is easy to follow: a series of questions at the beginning of each chapter, with key points at the end.

As to whether a woman with H.I.V. should consider pregnancy, the authors urge a careful examination of potential risks of the disease and its medications for both mother and child. The chances of transmitting H.I.V., they write, are influenced by how well the mother's infection is controlled. Certain medical conditions, like hepatitis C, can also increase the risk of transmission to the baby.

H.I.V. infection also appears to increase the risk of bone-thinning osteoporosis, and of osteonecrosis, the death of bone. The authors write that certain H.I.V. treatments may affect blood fat levels that, when elevated, can increase the risk of heart attack. H.I.V. can also cause vaginal yeast infections, abnormal Pap smears, genital warts and pelvic infections.",06/07/2004
The New York Times,New H.I.V. Test Lets Officials Reach Out to the Street,"""This makes a huge difference to fragile, marginalized communities where people have disorganized lives,"" said Dr.. Sandra R. Hernández, the former director of the San Francisco Public Health Department who is chief executive of the San Francisco Foundation, which offers grants for community programs like this one.

Continuum, an AIDS organization in San Francisco, provides the tests and tent. The organizers have tried to make it less intimidating than a clinic or a van displaying a health department logo. Participants can snack on free food and watch an Eddie Murphy comedy on a television set.

""The tent is more approachable,"" the Continuum executive director, Mark Cloutier, said. ""It's playful and carnivallike.""

Participants are offered $10 grocery vouchers, cups of instant soup, health bars, juice, toiletries, unlimited number of condoms and, for addicts, a needle-cleaning kit. And bottled water. For people on the streets, water may be as difficult to find as a bathroom.

Recently, two participants, Deborah Brooks and Terrence Davis, old friends, were giddy about their momentary good fortune. But there was a catch. They had to answer direct and often graphic questions about drugs and sexual practices.

In a traditional setting, they might have been asked, ""Tell me why you're here?"" in front of strangers with other medical needs, said Cicily Emerson, director of prevention services at Continuum.

Under the tent, Ms. Emerson said, where everyone is having the same test, a counselor in a private space can ask more intrusive questions, beginning with, ""What brings you in to be tested today?"" and moving to sex and drug histories.

In the 20-minute wait for his results, Mr. Davis conferred with a counselor. He had spent nearly half his life in prison for drug-related crimes and occasionally, he said, had been less than careful with sex partners. The counselor asked what he would do if the result was positive.

""It's scary,"" Mr. Davis conceded. ""But it's not going to make me commit suicide.""

Nationally, federal studies have found that 90 percent of people who learn that they are positive alter their risky behavior, lessening the chance of spreading the disease. Participants who test positive in the tent are funneled to health programs, making them more likely to behave responsibly, Mr. Cloutier said.

Women who are negative but have positive partners are offered more counseling. A $790,000 grant from the Centers for Disease Control to Continuum for two years also pays for $10 food vouchers for some participants for every friend they bring in.

A few participants grasped their possessions in droopy plastic bags. Others wheeled suitcases behind them. Even though the city has confiscated park benches from the area and installed sharp-edged iron fences to keep the homeless and transients off the statues, the plaza near City Hall remains their territory, which is why the yellow tent goes up in the same place every Tuesday.

For decades, the largest number of people with AIDS here lived in the Castro, an upscale gay neighborhood with gingerbread Victorian houses. More recently, the most densely populated section for H.I.V. and AIDS has shifted to the Tenderloin, a mixed area with immigrant families, transients, users of intravenous drugs and the homeless. On Thursdays, the yellow tent is there.

Of the 650 people tested at the two sites, 40 have been found H.I.V. positive. Twenty of those had previously been tested, according to city records. That has raised the question of whether the experiment is concentrating on the neediest areas.

Officials are considering moving the tent to Bayview, a predominantly African-American area, and under a freeway, where the most alienated homeless people congregate.

For now, the City Hall site remains. After his counseling session, Mr. Davis was told his test was negative. He sighed and smiled.

Ms. Brooks, who said she injects amphetamines and whose lover is a female sex worker, learned that she, too, was negative.

""The counseling must be working,"" she said, ""because I'm listening.""

Ms. Brooks scooped up hygiene packets and dashed into the street, taking her $10 voucher to buy vodka.",16/12/2004
The New York Times,BOOKS ON HEALTH; Smart Approach to H.I.V.,"''The First Year -- H.I.V.: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed,'' by Brett Grodeck. Marlowe & Company, $15.95.

It is hard to be optimistic about an incurable disease, but the author of this supportive resource, a writer who has had H.I.V. for 25 years, manages to do it. ''Now that I'm healthy,'' he writes, ''I'm far more worried about getting in a car accident on the Los Angeles Freeway than I am about getting sick from H.I.V.''

Mr. Grodeck, an online editor for the RAND Corporation, guides readers through the first seven days after diagnosis, the next three weeks, and the rest of the year.

Combining the human element with essential information about treatment options, choosing the right doctors, the importance of diet and exercise, holistic alternatives and sex, the book transforms a complex disease into one that can be understood and managed.

In his discussion of treatment options, Mr. Grodeck takes a level-headed approach.

While noting that the new generation of medicines, taken together in various combinations, can slow or even halt the virus, he cautions that so-called alternative therapies do not improve the course of H.I.V. and that some are dangerous and can make the infection worse.

''If you like gambling,'' he writes, ''you'll love herbal medicine. Most herbal or plant-based medicines haven't been properly tested, so they are risky.'' Moreover, he says, people taking prescription drugs should ''be careful about taking herbs and supplements.''",09/12/2003
The New York Times,Fake Letters Warn of Positive H.I.V. Results,"Imagine receiving a letter from a renowned hospital, telling you that one of your sexual partners has tested positive for H.I.V., and that you might be infected. Now add another, disturbing layer to this dark tale: the letter is a fake, and someone has picked you to be the target of a hoax.

That is what has happened since early last month to at least 10 people who have received letters claiming to be from Mount Sinai Hospital. A hospital spokesman, Mel Granick, said that Mount Sinai knew of no connection among the victims, and had no idea how they were chosen, or who the letter writer might be.

A few weeks ago, officials in Virginia revealed that someone had sent a batch of nearly identical bogus letters that appeared to be from Virginia Hospital Center, near Washington. The similarities are strong enough, Mr. Granick said, to raise suspicions that the same person is responsible in both cases.

Mount Sinai notified the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is investigating. A spokeswoman for that office, Barbara Thompson, said that depending on the circumstances, creating and sending the letters could constitute a crime like possession of a false instrument - akin to forgery - or aggravated harassment.

The New York Times,"Amid Tabloid Reports, Charlie Sheen Plans ‘Revealing Personal Announcement’","The gossip site Radar Online lit an online brush fire on Nov. 2 when it published a lengthy post about an unnamed actor’s HIV-positive diagnosis. Other celebrity sites followed with their own reports — without naming the actor — but The National Enquirer on Monday identified the star as Mr. Sheen. Other media outlets, including People magazine and Radar, subsequently did the same.

NBC’s “Today” show said on Monday that Mr. Sheen would make “a revealing personal announcement” on its Tuesday edition. NBC released no further information about its interview beyond saying that Mr. Sheen would talk with Matt Lauer.

Over the years, Mr. Sheen, 50, has openly acknowledged extensive drug use and the hiring of prostitutes. His private life became the focus of global media coverage in 2011 after he had a drug-fueled public meltdown and CBS shut down production of his hit sitcom “Two and a Half Men.” Mr. Sheen was subsequently fired from the series, but he quickly returned with the FX comedy “Anger Management.”

That series has since been canceled. IMDBpro, a more extensive and fee-based version of the Internet Movie Database, indicates that Mr. Sheen has no television or movie projects currently in the works.

Mr. Bragman, who specializes in helping celebrities disclose sensitive information, in particular their sexual identity, noted that public understanding of HIV has come a long way since 1991, when the basketball star Magic Johnson disclosed his positive status. Since then, Mr. Johnson, who was 32 at the time, has backed AIDS-related efforts for the United Nations and other advocacy groups.

In September, the actor Danny Pintauro, best known for his role on the 1980s-era comedy “Who’s the Boss?,” disclosed his HIV-positive status and struggle with drug addiction in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.",17/11/2015
The New York Times,"Is Truvada, the Pill to Prevent H.I.V., 99 Percent Effective? Don’t Be So Sure","But again, there is a problem of sample size. Dr. Anderson’s model found that patients who never took their prescribed Truvada had a 3 percent chance of contracting H.I.V. in a given year, which is a little lower than what was observed among patients taking a placebo. But that estimate comes with a range of confidence; perhaps the true figure is as low as 2 percent or as high as 7 percent. If the true figure is on the high end, then subjects who chose not to take their pills really did have greater independent risk of contracting H.I.V., in line with Dr. Buchbinder’s concern.

Then there is the issue of the model itself, what statisticians call a regression analysis. It fits a curve to the outcomes for participants in iPrEx, including many infections among people not taking Truvada, a handful among people taking it sporadically, and none among people who appear to have taken it daily. This approach effectively forces the estimate into a box: Infection risk must approach zero as frequency of Truvada dosing increases, because none of the high-adherence subjects became infected. If rare circumstances make infections possible among people with high blood levels of the drug (and two such infections were observed in a study of heterosexual couples, called Partners PrEP), that chance won’t be reflected in the model.

All of which is to say, while there are good reasons to find the 99 percent estimate plausible, the model is not so bulletproof as to say the figure was “shown in a major study.” Tim Horn, H.I.V. Project Director at the H.I.V. think-tank Treatment Action Group, said in an email, “Though it is possible that efficacy can approach 99 percent — language in the lay literature seems to be growing increasingly casual as to what this really means — the data supporting this currently exist in a vacuum.”

As such, Mr. Horn prefers to point to direct study findings, such as the 92 percent figure. Dr. Buchbinder uses qualitative descriptions, such as saying PrEP is “highly effective” and can “drastically” reduce infection risk if taken daily.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has headed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and was one of the leading researchers involved in developing antiretroviral therapy for H.I.V., has perhaps found the best way to split the difference. Dr. Fauci told me PrEP is “highly efficacious, in my mind easily over 90 percent if you adhere rigidly to it,” without specifically citing the 99 percent figure. He was quick to add, in line with the guidelines from all the United States government agencies encouraging the use of Truvada as a preventive measure, that it’s meant to augment the protection provided by condoms, not to replace them.

From a policy perspective, the difference between 92 percent and 99 percent is not necessarily very important: Either way, PrEP looks to be a highly useful tool for reducing the spread of H.I.V. Any reduction in the 90-percent range looks extremely impressive when you consider a C.D.C. study from last year finding that gay men who said they “always” used condoms were only 70 percent less likely to contract H.I.V. than those who said they never used them. With perfect use, condoms (like PrEP) may approach 100 percent effectiveness, but in the real world, people often use them improperly, or do not use them through the entirety of intercourse, or “forget” to use them despite an intent to do so. The failure of condoms as a prevention strategy is one reason Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made PrEP one of three planks in his strategy to end the H.I.V. epidemic in New York.

But while either level of effectiveness argues for the use of PrEP, “99 percent effective” is a message that differs psychologically in an important way from “90 percent effective.” Bear in mind, PrEP is about reducing the probability of an already low-probability event. If the participants in iPrEx not taking medication had a 3-4 percent chance of contracting H.I.V. in a given year, 99-percent effective daily use of PrEP would reduce their annual risk of infection to 0.04 percent, or 4 in 10,000. That happens to be equal to the risk of accidental death for the average American in a given year. If you don’t walk around preoccupied with the idea that you might be hit by a bus, it’s hard to blame a PrEP user expecting 99-percent effectiveness for effectively discounting the idea he might become infected with H.I.V.

The failure of a 90-percent effective method is terrible luck; the failure of a 99-percent effective method is verging on a freakish accident. Putting too much weight on the 99-percent figure may lead some PrEP users to perceive virtually zero H.I.V. risk when they should really be thinking about very low risk. As Dr. Buchbinder puts it, “I try to be cautious when telling patients what they should expect, just because I don’t want to overpromise something that isn’t the case.”",17/07/2014
The New York Times,White House Marks World AIDS Day,"Jonathan Ernst/Reuters

A stunning, large red AIDS ribbon adorns the North Portico of the White House in advance of World AIDS Day on Tuesday.

The Obama administration held an event on Monday to tout its commitments to combating HIV/AIDS, announcing that the 2012 International Aids Conference will be held in Washington, D.C. The declaration comes on the heels of the administration’s decision in October to lift the ban against travel to the United States by those with the HIV virus.

It’s not the first time that the two-story AIDS ribbon has dressed the White House. It became part of the recognition of World Aids Day in 2007 during the administration of former President George W. Bush, whose advocacy for combatting the disease became well known under PepFar (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) across the world.

But on the eve of the actual day, ABC News reported on Monday that global AIDS groups were giving President Obama a D-plus for efforts on this front.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose husband, the former President Bill Clinton has used his global initiatives to knock down barriers to less expensive drug cocktails around the world, asserted today that this administration was doing its part. “It is clear that our nation’s investments in HIV/AIDS are having an impact,” she said.",30/11/2009
The New York Times,Mrs. Bush's Remarks on AIDS,"The emergency plan works in partnership with the hardest-hit countries, and that partnership is saving lives. When President Bush announced PEPFAR at the beginning of 2003, only 50,000 people in sub- Saharan Africa were thought to be receiving antiretroviral treatment. Now, in PEPFAR's 15 focus nations, the United States has helped provide treatment for more than 560,000 people. Even more are being reached through America's contributions to the Global Fund.

This direct medical care keeps people in good health. And education is spreading hope. Millions are now learning to live with HIV/AIDS instead of waiting to die for it -- from it. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, new data shows that Africa's ABC model of AIDS prevention has led to dramatic declines in HIV infection rates in young men and women. Pregnant mothers with HIV now know that their unborn children don't have to inherit the disease.

These are important victories. But in order to defeat AIDS, much work remains.

All people need to know how AIDS is transmitted, and every country has an obligation to educate its citizens. This is why every country must also improve literacy, especially for women and girls, so that they can make wise choices that will keep them healthy and safe.

There are too few doctors and nurses to meet the demands of the AIDS crisis, so the United States is dedicating PEPFAR resources to train community health workers in African cities and villages. Many more are needed, and I encourage all member states to contribute to this effort. Every worker trained helps build a sustainable health care infrastructure -- one that can also help curb malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases. But lifesaving treatment never reaches people who do not know they're infected, so we must make sure more people know their HIV status. Here in the United States, June 27th is recognized as National HIV Testing Day. The United States will soon propose the designation of an International HIV Testing Day. I urge all member states to join us in support of this initiative. (Applause.)

I've met people around the world living with HIV/AIDS, people like Babalwa Mbono. In 2002, Babalwa was pregnant with her second child when she discovered she was HIV-positive. Worried about her unborn baby, Babalwa sought counseling at one of Africa's Mothers-to- Mothers-to-Be Centers, where infected women receive treatment to keep their unborn children from contracting HIV. Babalwa's baby was born

HIV-free, and now Babalwa is a site coordinator for the mothers program, sharing her experience with other women. Millions of people like Babalwa can now have a second chance at life. Their needs are great, but so is the inspiration they provide. And it's a privilege to stand with them.

Thank you for your commitment to defeating this pandemic. The United States looks forward to working with you, and to finally winning the fight against AIDS.

Thank you all very much. (Applause.)

The New York Times,World's Second Man Cleared of AIDS Virus Invigorates Quest for Cure,"LONDON/CHICAGO — Scientific investigation into the world's second man cleared of the AIDS virus is zooming in on a gene and a treatment side-effect, as newly-enthused researchers strive to find a cure for the disease that has killed millions.

Known as the ""London Patient"", the man had HIV and a type of blood cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma. He responded successfully to a bone marrow transplant from a donor with rare genetic resistance to HIV infection.

The transplant cleared the man's cancer and his HIV, but the resistant genes may not be the sole cause of his HIV remission.

Since the pandemic began in the 1980s, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV and about 35 million have died, most in Africa. Medical advances mean tests can detect HIV early, new drugs can control it, and there are ways to stop it spreading - but 37 million people still live with the virus.",06/03/2019
The New York Times,A Skin Care Purchase That Benefits More Than Your Face,"CHRISTMAS often signals the conclusion of many cause marketing initiatives that involve donations to charities or nonprofit organizations in exchange for consumers’ purchase of products. For one such effort, the day after Christmas is the beginning rather than the end.

On Thursday, Kiehl’s, the personal-care products company owned by L’Oréal, is to start a worldwide, six-week cause marketing promotion to benefit a nonprofit organization, Keep a Child Alive, that works to help children and families affected by HIV and AIDS. Kiehl’s is promising to donate to the organization all the net profits, up to $200,000, from the global sales of a special one-ounce bottle of its Midnight Recovery Concentrate serum (retail price in the United States: $46).

The limited-edition bottle is decorated with the Keep a Child Alive logo; a slogan, “Join our movement!”; and the name of the singer Alicia Keys, who founded the organization in 2003 with Leigh Blake. Ms. Keys narrates a video clip on YouTube that explains the promotion and how the proceeds will support “our mission to get treatment, food, care and love to people around the world who need it most.”

“Pick up a box for yourself or a loved one and feel beautiful on the inside and out,” Ms. Keys concludes. “So come, join the movement.”",24/12/2013
The New York Times,Ghost Generation,"The generation of south-east Africans lost to HIV/AIDS.

In a fascinating Guardian article, Jemma Neville explored the rise in abuse and violence toward older women in areas of Mozambique and Tanzania:

The standing of older people in the community, largely based on age and wisdom, is being eroded as urbanisation and migration have led to the abuse and neglect of older people by their relatives.

Neville suggests that one of the reasons for this rise in persecution is that some older women are “regarded with suspicion for having outlived many of their own children – the so-called ghost generation of HIV/AIDS. Unicef estimates that 14 percent of all children in Tanzania are orphans, of whom 64 percent are cared for by grandparents.”",26/11/2008
The New York Times,"Sex and Drugs Decline Among Teens, but Depression and Suicidal Thoughts Grow","One in seven high school students reported misusing prescription opioids, one of several disturbing results in a nationwide survey of teenagers that revealed a growing sense of fear and despair among youth in the United States.

The numbers of teenagers reporting “feelings of sadness or hopelessness,” suicidal thoughts, and days absent from school out of fear of violence or bullying have all risen since 2007. The increases were particularly pointed among lesbian, gay and bisexual high school students.

Nationally, 1 in 5 students reported being bullied at school; 1 in 10 female students and 1 in 28 male students reported having been physically forced to have sex.

“An adolescent’s world can be bleak,” said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the survey and analyzed the data. “But having a high proportion of students report they had persistent feelings of hopelessness and 17 percent considering suicide is deeply disturbing.”",14/06/2018
The New York Times,F.D.A. to Weigh At-Home Testing for AIDS Virus,"The test, called OraQuick Advance Rapid HIV- 1/2 Antibody Test, is presently sold only to doctors and clinics. It has already proven to be effective, safe and easy to use. So the remaining hurdles are decisions by the F.D.A. about whether approving such a device is a good idea and whether people can understand the product's label well enough to administer it to themselves.

A 1987 application for an at-home AIDS test kit led to years of controversy. At the time, AIDS advocates and public health officials predicted that such a test would cause widespread suicides, panic and a rush to public health clinics.

At hearings, AIDS advocates handed out copies of an obituary of a San Francisco man who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge after discovering that he was infected with HIV. An official for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the F.D.A. that such tests could lead to ""a sudden increase in referrals to already overburdened health clinics,"" according to an F.D.A. document.

Federal regulators stalled the application for nine years, and at-home AIDS testing never caught on.

Some AIDS advocates are now warily supportive of at-home testing.

""For people who don't have access to a clinic or make a decision not to go to a clinic, this is better than nothing,"" said Gregg Gonsalves of Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, which opposed at-home AIDS testing 18 years ago and offers testing and counseling itself. ""But it's not a magic bullet.""

The switch by advocates is important. Politics have long played a crucial role in many F.D.A. decisions, according to longtime agency observers and previous agency officials. Recently, the agency decided to delay a decision on whether to allow over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive. The decision was seen by some inside and outside of the agency as politically driven, and it led a top agency official to resign in protest.

Dr. Spielberg said that about a quarter of the nearly million people in the United States who have the HIV virus in their blood do not know that they are infected. And somewhere between 40 percent and 45 percent of those who test positive for HIV do so less than a year before they are diagnosed with AIDS.

Since an HIV infection often takes a decade to develop into full-blown AIDS, ""this suggests that people are living with HIV, and spreading HIV for many years before they are aware of their infection,"" she said.

Many of these people avoid getting tested in clinics for a variety of reasons, including fear of discovery and convenience, studies show. And many hate having to wait more than a week for a lab result, surveys show.

Dr. Spielberg said that she surveyed 240 people infected with HIV and found that more than half said that they would have preferred to have found out about their infection with a rapid at-home test.

Having a rapid, over-the-counter test widely available, Dr. Spielberg said, ""is the most powerful strategy we have to bring down HIV infections."" People who find out that they are infected with HIV often change their sexual behavior to reduce further infections, she said.

By contrast, OraQuick requires a person to simply swab their gums and then place the swab in a holder. Twenty minutes later, a strip displays one line for a negative result and two lines for a positive one.

The argument against at-home tests has long been that they failed to ensure that patients would get adequate counseling. Activists now acknowledge that many people who get HIV tests in doctors' offices get little or no counseling anyway.

""The counseling that now occurs is very short or abrupt in many settings,"" said Gene Copello, executive director of The AIDS Institute, a Washington-based policy group.

Doug Michels, president and chief executive of OraSure, said he plans to include advice about counseling on OraQuick's label. ""It could be a hotline number, a 24-hour manned counseling center, Web support or printed material that is included in the product,"" he said.

The company said it would include whatever the advisory committee and the F.D.A. deems is necessary, he said. The company now sells the device for between $12 and $17, although the price of an over-the-counter version has yet to be decided, Mr. Michels said.",13/10/2005
The New York Times,New Illinois Law Permits Organ Donors With H.I.V.,"''We're hopeful that by removing an obstacle in Illinois, they'll be able to make change at the federal level,'' Ms. Ottenhoff said.

Details of how Illinois's plan will work are far from being sorted out. Advocates said it would essentially require the creation of a separate organ donor pool in the state just for those with H.I.V. As is already the case, all organ donors would continue to be screened for infection, disease and other problems. In years past, people with H.I.V. were not considered good candidates for receiving organs because of their reduced life expectancy. That was because drug treatments were far less advanced and life expectancies of potential H.I.V.-positive organ recipients were far shorter.

''This was not a topic five years ago, but it certainly is now,'' said David Munar, associate director of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. ''And that tells you something about how things have changed.''

Mr. Munar said that the number of people with H.I.V. who are waiting for organ transplants was unknown, but that their most common need was a liver, since the livers of those with both H.I.V. and hepatitis C tend to fail especially swiftly. Donor wait lists can now be years long -- too long, in many cases, for those with H.I.V. and hepatitis and failing livers.

In Springfield, Representative McKeon won his fight to pass the organ donation legislation with little trouble. It passed the House, which is dominated by Democrats, 95 to 22, and the Senate, also dominated by Democrats, with 55 in favor, 2 opposed and 1 ''present.'' The legislation applies to organ donors with H.I.V. or full-blown AIDS, and to those who are living at the time of the donation as well as to those who have just died. It applies only to organ donation, not blood donations or bone marrow transplants.

View all New York Times newsletters.

The most serious questions Mr. McKeon said he received were related to safety. Some colleagues wondered: How can a doctor ensure that an H.I.V.-negative patient does not accidentally receive the organ of someone with H.I.V.? And can there be any additional danger to those who already have HIV from a different strain of it?

''There are reasonable fears,'' Mr. McKeon acknowledged. ''But my position and the position of the medical people is that this doesn't add any increased risk.''

Human error that could occur in any organ donation situation -- where a donor has the wrong blood type or an unrecognized problem like rabies (as in a recent set of fatal cases) -- is no more likely in cases involving those with H.I.V., he said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Dr. Robert Murphy, a professor of infectious diseases at Northwestern University, said he believed that the transfer of organs from one H.I.V.-positive person to another was safe. But, he said, doctors must be extremely careful and fully aware of their patients' medical treatments and histories.

''We know what the risks are and we are going to look at it very closely,'' Dr. Murphy said. ''Let's do it, and if it works, instead of throwing away these good organs, we can save a lot of people. When you see someone die of liver disease, you want to do anything to stop it.''

''This is safe,'' he continued. ''What's not safe is to let a person who is infected with H.I.V. just die because they can't get an organ. If there were lots of organs to go around, you wouldn't have to do this, but that is absolutely not the case.''

But Dr. Robert Harland, a transplant surgeon at the University of Chicago, said that the practice was untested and that it might be possible for an H.I.V.-positive person to be infected with a different strain of the virus during an organ transplant.

''This is in its infancy,'' Dr. Harland said. ''It's totally unknown at this point in time.''",16/07/2004

The New York Times,South Africa’s Zuma Answers His Critics,"Jacob Zuma, newly-elected head of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress, took time Thursday to address one of the many lingering controversies related to his attitude towards HIV/AIDS.

Call it the question of the shower.

On trial for rape charges in 2006, of which he was acquitted, Mr. Zuma was widely quoted as saying he believed he would reduce the risk of contracting AIDS by taking a shower after sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive woman.

His remark fed into a deep and bitter controversy over South African policy towards its AIDS crisis, fed by official reluctance at the time to identify the HIV virus as the cause of AIDS.

Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum, Mr Zuma insisted that his remarks about AIDS and the shower had been taken out of context.

Some people, he said, ”put it as if I said that taking a shower cures AIDS. It’s not true. I didn’t say so. I was answering the question: What did you do after this? It included me taking the shower. But then it was taken out of context.”

Mr. Zuma’s presence among the 2,500 participants attending the World Economic forum represented his first major foreign foray after he defeated President Thabo Mbeki in elections last December for the leadership of the African National Congress. He was invited to Davos at the least moment after Mr. Mbeki cancelled his own plans to attend, Forum officials said.

”I’m here mainly to learn,” he said. But he defended South Africa’s record on seeking political change in Zimbabwe and said Africans alone could not be blamed for the continent’s woes.

Mr. Zuma is facing a separate trial on corruption charges this year but that has not deterred him from his plan to stand as a candidate for South Africa’s next President in elections scheduled for mid-2009. If elected, he would adhere to his party’s ”comprehensive plan and policy to deal with HIV and AIDS,” he said. Asked about his likely attitude to white minority if elected president of the country, he said he would promote racial and ethnic diversity.

He said the corruption charges would not thwart his presidential bid unless he was found guilty. ”We are a country that practices the rule of law,” he said. “Charges don’t mean you are guilty as long as there has been no conviction.” – Alan Cowell",24/01/2008

The New York Times,Learning From Soap Operas,"TIRANA, ALBANIA — A friend of mine, a physician who works the longest hours of anybody I know, makes only one exception from her demanding schedule in New York. Once a week, she returns home early to watch a new episode of her favorite soap opera.

I cannot think of a more unlikely fan. It goes to show that soap operas appeal across a broad spectrum, from the most intellectually sophisticated to people with little or no formal education.

So it should come as no surprise that soap operas, or telenovelas, are increasingly being used throughout the world to disseminate messages about health issues such as the need for contraception, domestic violence, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, how to achieve peace between countries in conflict and how to elevate the status of women in developing countries. By identifying themselves with the protagonists’ dreams and problems the viewer establishes an immediate connection with them.

In Colorado, state officials have developed a telenovela called “Crossroads: Without Health, There Is Nothing,” specifically aimed at conveying health messages to the population. One of the producers’ aims was to increase the number of health-insured kids in the state, since almost half of the 150,000 uninsured children were eligible either for Medicaid or the Child Health Plan Plus program. Following the airing of the telenovelas, there was a substantial increase in the number of children applying for insurance.

The New York Times,Four Stars for a Tough-Talking Campaign,"The Internet is also a central focus of the campaign, which includes a dedicated Web site (loveandrespect.us), designed by Indigo6, an agency in Norwalk, Conn., and video clips of the commercials, which can be watched on youtube.com and MySpace (myspace.com/looklistenloverespect).

Although the campaign has a national distribution, it began as a collaboration between two organizations in New York, HIV Forum NYC and the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. Financial support for the ads is coming from two other organizations, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, representing the theater community, and Cable Positive, for the cable TV industry.

The campaign offers a twist on the time-honored tactic of celebrity endorsements for causes as well as for commercial purposes, both intended to sprinkle a bit of stardust on the brands or organizations being promoted.

Almost from the days that stars first began to be paid to peddle products, they also lent a hand – free of charge -- to raise money for charitable organizations. The list of beneficiaries includes the March of Dimes, the Will Rogers Institute, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

More recently, celebrities have started to promote causes that are less mainstream and sometimes touch on hot-button issues. Among them are abortion rights, fighting global warming, ending poverty and preventing AIDS.

The four stars in the new campaign join other celebrities who have appeared in pro bono campaigns about AIDS and HIV including Bono, Richard Gere, Heidi Klum, Sharon Stone and Elizabeth Taylor.

“Our primary objective is to stimulate dialogue around HIV and gay men’s health,” says Dan Carlson, co-founder of HIV Forum NYC, who developed the campaign with Jay Laudato, executive director of Callen-Lorde, and Colin A. Weil, a writer, director and producer.

“HIV prevention these days is more nuanced from back in the day when it was, ‘Wear a condom, wear a condom, wear a condom,’” Mr. Carlson says.

“Everyone knows condoms prevent HIV, but infection rates have increased since 1999,” he says, adding: “It’s not an issue of education. It’s behavior, more of a commitment to personal health and to each other.”

The idea was that women could best “change the conversation about condom use,” Mr. Carlson says, “that it’s not a barrier or an inhibition or about feeling less, it’s an act of self-love, everyone’s responsibility, an act of respect for each other.”

Why women? “For gay men, we love our female icons,” Mr. Carlson says. “We felt these honest, direct, loving messages would be heard best if told by women we can see as our mothers, best friends, sisters.”

“They can tell us things we may not be ready to hear from each other,” he adds.

Another reason for women to appear in the campaign, Mr. Laudato says, is that “the message would be clouded if there were men” because the target audience may have wondered “Is he straight? Is he gay? Is he hot? Is he not?”

“We wanted people of stature,” Mr. Laudato says, “and frankly, I don’t think we would have gotten men of similar stature” because well-known actors may have been more reluctant “to talk about controversial things” than the actresses are.

To say the four actresses touch on controversial topics in their eight commercials is an understatement.

For instance, in one of the two commercials featuring Ms. Perez, she declares: “Safe sex can be hot sex. I mean, trust me. It just takes a little imagination.”

One of the two spots with Ms. Sarandon begins with her saying: “You’re at a club. You just met. He’s really hot, and you go home together. Now, the moment of truth. Do you talk about HIV?”

In the other commercial, Ms. Sarandon discusses what research shows is a correlation between the growing use of the drug crystal meth (methamphetamine) and the increase in HIV infection rates.

That subject is brought up in other spots, too. Ms. Peet says, “Be a friend, say something” if someone you know is using the drug. Ms. Perez asserts, “You can join the party without losing your head.”

Ms. Goldberg may be the frankest of all. “Come over here, we need to talk,” she says at the start of both her spots. One focuses on drug use: “Do you really think doing crystal meth makes you cool? Meth makes you do dumb stuff like barebacking” – that is, have sex without a condom.

In her other commercial, Ms. Goldberg mocks the idea that barebacking is cool by countering that “fighting back” and “love and respect” are actually cool.

Mr. Weil praises the actresses for agreeing to deliver what he calls “compassionate and caring messages” that, by using women rather than men, are “not clouded by sex per se.”

Gay men are vexed by “self-image uses, self-esteem issues, isolation issues,” Mr. Weil says. “At the end of the day, they’re not taking care of themselves because they feel they’re not worth it.”

So the campaign, along with others from organizations like GMHC (Gay Men’s Health Crisis), which carry themes like “HIV stops with me,” is intended to say, “We’re all part of the problem and we’re all part of the solution,” Mr. Weil says.

That approach has generated considerable debate within the gay community, centered on the concept that ads deemed judgmental of behavior can be counterproductive because the target audience tunes out the criticism as nagging, scolding or simplistic.

Some computer users who posted comments about the campaign on a popular blog, Towleroad (towleroad.com), were quite critical.

“Everyone needs to show responsibility in their sexual behavior, not just gay men,” one poster wrote. Another poster made a snide remark about Ms. Peet’s acting abilities.

A third poster wrote: “Selecting four random women to deliver the message feels a lot like Nancy Reagan’s ‘Just say no’ campaign. Frankly, when an old woman tells me not to do something, it just makes me want to do it more.”

Mr. Laudato says he was “horrified” by some of the posts. Mr. Carlson says he was surprised by the tone the complainers took because “from my perspective, they were missing the message.”

“For many years, we’ve been told we’re not valued and our relationships were not valued,” he adds. “A more positive message might be a little difficult to hear, even from people like Susan and Whoopi, who’ve been with us for many years and come to this with a tremendous amount of credibility.”

A second round of commercials is being considered, the three creators of the campaign say, which they hope would be out for the annual series of gay pride events in June.

Mr. Weil says they are “open to a different type of cast” next time, “maybe out gay actors.”

No fair asking a catty question like, “Will they hold the casting call inside a phone kiosk?”

The New York Times,A New Approach to Biofuel in Africa,"The biofuel concept: If you just burn plant materials, you put out a lot of bad pollutants. But if you heat the materials in a container without oxygen (“pyrolysis”), you leave most of the carbon as “biochar,” which makes an excellent soil additive (in fact Amazon Indians built up rich soils over hundreds of years using biochar). The gas that is given off by pyrolysis can be processed into clean-burning fuel. All of which sounds great, but skeptics point out that Africa is a prime target for biofuel land grabs, which destroy small farms and forest preserves. Hence the importance of using agricultural residues like corn cobs, and researching the impact.

If you send a known gas mixture into the biofuel apparatus, you get some characteristic flame “profile” –shape, color and temperature. Now send through an unknown gas at the same rate—produced by pyrolysis of corn cobs for example—and you can find the nearest profile, giving a rough assessment for the biofuel potential, which is all we need for our mission here. In December we will bring KNUST students back to RPI, where they will carry out more precise testing of the chemical composition.

Ron Eglash

But you can’t compare flames unless you have the gases flowing at the same rate, and our flow meter needed a final adjustment inside its tube. We couldn’t find a needle-nose pliers or tweezers to reach inside, but KNUST resourcefulness had rubbed off on our undergrad engineers at this point, and they fashioned a tool from a spare hairpin. With the addition of a combustion chamber adapted from a filter canister, the system is now ready for testing.

Audrey Bennett’s HIV workshop had also taken a productive turn. She began with a half-dozen KNUST students, and they discussed their understanding of HIV transmission and local prevention campaigns. One of them maintained that there are condom shortages in Ghana, especially on Valentine ’s Day. Favorite prevention campaigns included a local KNUST billboard, “Acquire a degree, not HIV,” and a billboard showing a bus covered with a condom (emphasizing the transmission that occurs in the context of migrant workers and transportation). Audrey then showed them the posters created by a rural group in Kenya during one of her previous projects, and an interactive poster she had created, based on one of the Kenyan designs, that allowed users to change images and text.

Finally it was time to set the students lose on creating their own sketches for poster concepts. Fortunately the student who had what everyone agreed was the best design—a soccer-based poster that read “Give AIDS the red card”—was able to find time to return to his community and test out the idea. He reported that several suggested the poster should also show a condom. Audrey held a quick photo shoot (the original image showed a white hand holding the card), and soon had a finished prototype. Her next steps will be to create a small hand-out to go with the poster—an actual red card with HIV prevention tips.

Lastly, the math education project at Ayeduase jr. high school: on our final two days we focused on fractals. First we just covered the idea of repeated geometric transformations using cornrow hairstyles. Since the website includes a cultural history of cornrows, this gave me a chance to see how the students in Ghana thought about their connection to African American culture. They were a bit more reluctant to discuss the slave trade era (perhaps only because they knew less about it), but just like African American students they all wanted to focus on the hip-hop section of the history.

On the final day we moved from the simple scaling series of cornrows to the fully recursive patterns of other African Fractals. We had previously found a spectacular example of fractal kente cloth in Bonwire, and the students used our software to produce some terrific fractal designs of their own. Several seemed fascinated by fractals in Ethiopian designs related to Christianity. My favorite was a piece two students created that featured a scaling array of crosses. But I have to say that the best moment for me was when we left the computer lab and walked outside to look at fractals in bark and branches. It was that moment when they connected math and African culture to their own power to investigate the world around them.",12/07/2010
The New York Times,Sex in This City,"NAIROBI — Kenya’s cosmopolitan capital barely sleeps. Not only are most workers up before the sun, for many young men and women, the predawn hour is when the real fun starts.

Then, Nairobi’s youth spill out of clubs and bars, and head for their chips funga — a slangy way of describing French fries to go. In Kiswahili, funga means “to be covered,” a reference to the way any late night greasy spoon will bundle your potatoes in tinfoil or a paper bag for takeaway. But among the young and hungry, chips funga has become a euphemism for taking a paramour home from the club.

The term works as a noun (“chips” or “chipo”), verb (“to chip”) adjective (“chipsed”) or past participle (“chipoed”). In many ways it’s the antidote to funga ndao — meaning to marry, or “tie the knot.” Chips Funga is now also the name of a Web site for online dating in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

Kenyan youth, who love wordplay, have come up with variations. A “corporate funga”: a tryst during the week; a “regular funga”: a more consistent companion; a “sausage funga”: a man who is taken home by a woman.

To me, sausage funga reveals a new culture of female empowerment. Too bad the policies and programs related to sexual health in Africa are not improving fast enough to keep pace with sexual mores.

Upwardly mobile, working and educated women in Kenya are taking ownership over casual sex. In a post titled “You’re Really Terrible in Bed. Honestly!” a female Kenyan blogger explains:

“It’s an unwritten rule that a sausage funga should not by any chance sleep over, request for a toothbrush, insist on using one of your towels, stay long enough to even open up the fridge and make you breakfast that was not asked for, ask for your number or take you out for lunch etc. This is just a NO-go zone.”

This is a forward-leaning statement. It implies financial independence, a level playing field for female opinions and even a right to satisfaction.

Unfortunately, this sassy stance is unusual. In Kenya and in Africa generally, women are rarely so well off or so well regarded as to run the show. Most African women have very little control over how and when they have sex, and consequently, when they bear children — or if they contract HIV/AIDS.

Just 46 percent of women in Kenya use contraception, and the figure dips dramatically outside of urban centers. Those who want contraception often can’t get it due to high prices or shortages. Sporadic sexual activity — fungas — actually reduces the likelihood of proper use. And women who rely on hormonal birth control are more likely to be casual about condom use.

Given Kenya’s rates of sexually transmitted disease — about 1.5 million people there are living with HIV — the funga culture is a dangerous form of empowerment.

On July 11, the Gates Foundation and the British government are convening a massive summit on family planning. It’ll mark a useful turnabout. In part at their behest, for a while much of the funding for health in Kenya has been spent on preventing malaria and HIV rather than improving access to contraception. And it’s rare to see a “talk to your partner” practicum or even a male-focused outreach campaign.

Thus it was encouraging to hear, last week, Kenyan popular radio specifically debating contraceptive methods and the role men can play in safe sexual practices. A recent national study concluded that urban Kenyan men are willing to talk with women about protection — even if few of them bring up the topic themselves.

In addition to joking about takeaway food, young Kenyans could explore another kind of sausage funga: insisting that sex itself take place “covered up.”",26/06/2012
The New York Times,Kofi Annan's Remarks on AIDS,"The following are the remarks made by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, as provided by Federal News Service.

Mr. President, distinguished delegates, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming today. I hope the fact that so many governments are represented here at the highest level today signals real commitment to our fight against HIV/AIDS.

In 25 years, AIDS has changed the world. It has killed 25 million people. It has become the leading cause of death among both men and women aged between 15 and 59. It has inflicted the single greatest reversal in history of human development. In other words, it has become the greatest challenge of our generation.

The world has finally begun to recognize this. Since this assembly held its Special Session on AIDS five years ago, the response has started to gain real strength. In some countries, there are fewer younger people being infected than five years ago, and seven times more people have access to treatment.

But the epidemic continues to outpace us. Last year, globally, there were more new infections than ever before, and more people died than ever before. There were more women and girls living with HIV/AIDS than ever before. There were more serious warnings that if we don't see radical change, we will get nowhere close to universal access of HIV prevention, treatment and care, and support, by 1020 (sic/2010), the goal that you committed yourselves to at the world summit last September. If we don't step up the fight drastically, we will not reach the Millennium Development Goal of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV and AIDS by 2015.

It requires real, positive change that will give more power and confidence to women and girls, and transform relations between women and men at all levels of society. It requires greater resources for women, better laws for women, and more seats for women at the decision-making table. It requires all of you to make the fight against AIDS your personal priority not only this session, or this year, or next year, but every year until the epidemic is reversed.

The New York Times,Must See: Videos Worth Watching,"“The Danger of Livestock Waste” (07:07)

In a modern society, clean drinking water is considered a citizen’s birthright. So why are some people in the United States apparently getting sick from their local drinking water? That’s the important question asked in “The Danger of Livestock Waste.” This video, by Brent McDonald and Charles Duhigg of The New York Times, is part of the Toxic Waters series examining clean-water problems in the United States.

The video takes us to rural Idaho, where we meet the Tom and Collette Kudlo, a middle-aged couple who moved there in the 1980s and who used to drink water from a private well. Not anymore. Now, they drink only bottled distilled water. They live just a few miles from a dairy farm, where some 20,000 to 30,000 cows produce as much sewage as a medium-sized city. The Kudlos say they have gotten sick and experienced reproductive problems from their well water, which they say has been contaminated by runoff from the farm.

Tests show that dangerous levels of bacteria, nitrates and pathogens have been detected in groundwater nationwide where people and livestock farms are in proximity. The video is informative and even a bit chilling. (E.O.)

“Where Children Find Hope”

Last month, The Detroit Free Press won a 2009 News and Documentary Emmy for its 2008 multimedia package “Where Children Find Hope.” It includes a terrific series of videos that shine a light on a handful of the 18,000 children in Michigan’s foster-care system.

For three years, The Free Press multimedia team documented the lives of the young male residents of Christ Child House on Detroit’s west side. Many of the boys have been in the system for years, and this is their last quality chance for adoption.

The producer Brian Kaufman punctuates his intimate interviews with Kathleen Galligan’s provocative photos to create seamless segments. The opening shots — wet snow against the reflection of a home in a car mirror — match the fractured tone of many of the young men’s voices. For instance, the young Carlos remembers his “first day here … after I saw Eric and Kevin fight, then I was like, I’m going to get used to this place.”

“Where Children Find Hope” is a compelling and detailed documentation of a world many never see. The work once again demonstrates the benefits of dedicating time and resources to such stories. In accompanying background notes, the writer Robin Erb says she failed as reporter. After her first day of reporting, she was unable to close her notebook and move on. Three years later, she and her multimedia colleagues are justly rewarded for their dedication and talent. (K.B.)

Also among the recent Emmy winners is a multimedia Web site dedicated to the impact of HIV on Jamaicans. In 2007, the poet and writer Kwame Dawes traveled five times to “the second Jamaica” — the area of the south coast, beyond the tourists and the all-inclusive hotels, to report on HIV in the region.

His poems, photographs and video reports culminate in this dynamic interactive Web site. The portraits, poems and music provide stirring lyrical texture to the two corollary video reports. In his second video, Mr. Dawes tells of Annesha, a young woman whose face appeared on HIV posters. Talking about the stigma of her status, she says, “It makes you want to kill yourself more faster.” Her story of survival is complex and human, and provides one of the sparkles of hope in this tapestry of struggle.

The New York Times,Scientists Explore Ways to Lure Viruses to Their Death,"The researchers engineered mice to produce CAR on their red blood cells and then compared how they fared against coxsackie virus B compared with normal mice. In the engineered mice, viruses reached only 1 percent to 10 percent of the levels they reached in many organs in normal mice. The normal mice all died within a week of infection. The engineered mice tended to live longer, and after two weeks a third of them were still alive.

Dr. Finberg’s experiments show that virus traps have some promise, but they do not reveal exactly why they failed to eradicate the virus. “What is the threshold for these traps so that they will force the viruses into extinction?” asks Paul E. Turner, an evolutionary biologist at Yale. Dr. Turner and his colleagues are trying to find the answer, but instead of studying mice, they are studying bacteria.

The researchers study a virus called phi-6, which normally infects a species of bacteria called Pseudomonas phaseolica, a microbe that lives on plants. The bacteria grab onto plants with long sticky hairs, which they retract to bring themselves close to their hosts. The phi-6 virus attaches to proteins on the hairs, and when the bacteria retract, the viruses can invade them.

A mutant form of Pseudomonas grows a lot of extra hairs, which make it an attractive target for viruses. But it cannot retract its hairs, so the viruses cannot get inside it to replicate. Dr. Turner and his colleagues reasoned that these mutants might act as traps for phi-6 viruses, luring them into a dead end.

Because Dr. Turner’s team study bacteria instead of mice, they can run many more experiments to discover the ecological rules of viral traps. Dr. Finberg’s team needed a year to design and raise a handful of mice with viral traps. Bacteria can breed by the billions in a few hours.

Dr. Turner and his colleagues created a mathematical model to predict how phi-6 would fair if they mixed viral traps into a colony of normal Pseudomonas hosts. They predicted that the more virus traps the scientists added, the more the virus population would shrink. Above a threshold of traps, the viruses would not be able replace their lost numbers, and they would disappear completely.

To test the model, the scientists mixed normal bacteria with different levels of mutant traps and then infected them with viruses. After letting the viruses replicate, the scientists took a small sample to start a new colony. They discovered there was indeed a trap threshold above which the virus population could not survive. Above that threshold, the viruses disappeared by the time the scientists started the third round of colonies.

Dr. Turner and his colleagues reported their results this month in the journal Ecology Letters.

Now Dr. Turner and his colleagues are using what they have learned with bacteria to study HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Normally, HIV infects immune cells called CD4 T cells. Dr. Turner’s team is building red blood cells studded with CD4 proteins on their surface, in the hope of building an HIV trap.

“Once we have those, we can test whether they truly attract HIV,” Dr. Turner said. “And then we can set up experiments like the ones we’ve done with bacteria.”

The next stage of their research would be to mix engineered red blood cells and normal immune cells in a dish and see whether they can trap HIV. Dr. Turner speculated that someday it might be possible to give HIV patients transfusions of engineered blood cells. The cells would lure the virus away from T cells, allowing a patient’s immune system to recover. And since red blood cells survive only a few months before being destroyed in the spleen, the trapped viruses would gradually disappear from the patient’s body.

“Of course, all this is science fiction at this point,” Dr. Turner said.

Dominik Wodarz, an expert on virus ecology at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the research, said: “I think it’s a very exciting concept. It’s something that makes a lot of sense.”

Dr. Wodarz cautioned that the ultimate success of such a strategy would depend on the details of HIV infection. At some points in an HIV infection, a single milliliter of blood can contain as many as 10 million viruses. “I don’t know if it would be possible to put enough traps in,” he said.

Dr. Turner acknowledged this uncertainty. It is also possible, he said, that viruses will mutate in such a way that they avoid the viral traps. “The data are exciting, but there are all these other intricacies that you have to address,” he said.

He also pointed that even if the virus was not completely destroyed in a patient, driving down the numbers would have significant benefits. It would keep the immune system from collapsing, which is what AIDS drugs are designed to do now. But traps might end up being cheaper.

Dr. Finberg is also exploring other ways to trap viruses. “We did it with red blood cells, but they didn’t have to be red blood cells,” he said. “Another way to do it would be to pull them out with beads.”

Dr. Finberg and his colleagues are currently running experiments with tiny protein-coated beads to see how effectively they act as traps.

Some viruses will be easier to trap than others, Dr. Finberg said. “A virus that only lives in cells, we’ll never have the opportunity to attack it,” he said. “With something that’s circulating, we’ll have the opportunity to get hold of it. At least it’s the easiest kind to start with.”",27/03/2007

The New York Times,Long Island Hospital Warns of Possibly Contaminated Syringe,"In an “abundance of caution,” a Long Island hospital sent out over 4,000 letters to patients recommending that they be tested for hepatitis and HIV because of concerns about the proper use of an insulin syringe, a hospital spokesman said.

Newsday reported that in a letter dated Feb. 22, South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside said patients may have received insulin from a syringe reservoir that could have been used more than once.

Damian Becker, a hospital spokesman, said that no one was observed reusing the reservoir but that a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so.

The risk of infection is “extremely low,” the hospital said. The hospital has set up a toll-free hotline for patients to schedule a blood test. The number is (516) 208-0029.",12/03/2014

The New York Times,Democratic Debate at Howard U.,"Senator Chris Dodd is not Paris Hilton. Tavis Smiley is not Alex Trebek. And both Michelle and Senator Barack Obama are HIV-free.

These were among the lighthearted moments of tonight’s debate at Howard University, where the eight Democratic presidential candidates came together at the historically black university to participate in the “All American Presidential Forum” broadcast on PBS and moderated by Tavis Smiley, the talk show host.

At a forum dominated by questions of particular importance to the country’s minority communities, the candidates used the opportunity to discuss their views on issues that ranged from education to unemployment to the disproportionately high rate of incarceration among African-Americans.

Against the backdrop of today’s Supreme Court decision on the use of race in integrating schools, Senator Hillary Clinton responded to a question about whether “the color line” still exists in America, and captured both the spirit and the contradiction of this evening’s debate.

“You can look at this stage and see an African American, a Latino, a woman contesting for the presidency of the United States,” she said. “But there is so much left to be done.”

Addressing the scourge of HIV/AIDS among African American teenagers, who are infected with the virus at much higher rates than the population as a whole, Mrs. Clinton offered a hypothetical:

“If HIV/AIDS were the leading cause of death of white women between the ages of 25 and 34, there would be an outraged outcry in this country,” she said. The statement turned out to be one of her biggest applause lines tonight.

In answering the same question, Senator Joe Biden said that he had been tested for HIV/AIDS and then referred to Mr. Obama as a fellow testee. The camera then panned briefly to Mr. Obama, looking vaguely stunned, and then to a straight-faced Reverend Al Sharpton in the audience.

“Tavis, Tavis, Tavis,” Mr. Obama interjected to laughter. “I just got to make clear — I got tested with Michelle when we were in Kenya in Africa. So I don’t want any confusion here about what’s going on.”



The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina offered Senator John Edwards a moment, to remind the audience that he had kicked off his campaign there, and wanted the next president of the United States to have an adviser who briefed the administration every day about something that had been done there the day before.

All the candidates said the United States should be doing more to address the crisis in Darfur, including enforcing a no-fly zone over Sudan and increasing the number of international peacekeepers in the region.

“It’s time for the United States to stop looking at Africa as a place where our corporations can exploit the people,” Mr. Kucinich said. “I mean, because let’s face it, let’s face it, if Darfur had a large supply of oil, this administration would be occupying it right now.”

Mr. Obama said the nation needed to focus more consistently on issues in Africa and “not just after a crisis happens.”

Because time was running out, the moderator, Mr. Smiley, limited Mr. Kucinich and Mr. Gravel to a mere 15 seconds to answer the question about Darfur.

Mr. Gravel, whose microphone seemed to malfunction just as he was trying to answer, was able to get only a few words in. In a moment that reminds of us a cell phone commercial, Mr. Gravel said: “What? No mike? You can’t hear me? You can hear me now?”

Yes, we could hear him, and Senator Dodd, ever the gentleman, lightly patted him on the back as the candidates filed off the stage.

The New York Times,Emily Oster's Research on AIDS,"In her research on AIDS, Emily Oster has come up with three main conclusions:

One, as I described in this week’s column, is that better-off, healthy Africans practice safer sex more than they once did — much as Americans do. But poorer Africans, who have much shorter average lifespans even if they don’t contract HIV, have not made as many changes.

Two — and arguably most important to the spread of the disease — other sexually transmitted diseases, like herpes, are far more common in Africa, and they ease the transmission of HIV. Medical researchers have long known that other diseases played an important role, but Ms. Oster thinks the role is even larger than many people have realized.

Three, the officials estimates on the number of AIDS cases are seriously exaggerated, perhaps by a factor of two or three, she says. But the estimates have been getting more accurate over time, which means that number of cases is actually growing more quickly than the official statistics suggest.

Ms. Oster summarized the work herself in a recent article in Esquire magazine. She has also posted her research papers (here, here and here) on her Web site.",09/01/2007
The New York Times,Answers About Gay Youth in New York,"Following is the first set of responses from Kai Wright, the author of “Drifting Toward Love: Black, Brown, Gay and Coming of Age on the Streets of New York” (Beacon Press, January 2008), who is responding to readers’ questions about gay youth in New York City; the challenges they face; and the future lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community they are creating.



We are no longer accepting questions for this feature.

Is this such a wide-spread issue in New York or in America for that matter that commands our attention? I don’t think so. This is your typical NY Times “agenda” article that is exclusively a Manhattan topic for discussion. Get real – there are more important issues that affect our daily lives than the supposed victimhood by individuals who base their existence on the sexual orientation and choice of lifestyle in the epicenter of American liberalism, NYC.

— Posted by William L. Esposito

This seems a good place to start. Mr. Esposito raises questions that, frankly, come up a great deal, particularly in communities of color and in families outside of major cities. They are worth addressing in a bit of detail.

The first implicit question is a straightforward numerical one. The U.S. Census Bureau does not tally people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, so there is no hard data on the community or where it lives. Advocates campaigned hard to add a sexual orientation question to the 2010 Census, but the census makes such changes quite slowly. We can tally the number of same-sex households, since that can be gathered from same-sex household members who check the partner box under relationship. The 2000 Census identified roughly 600,000 such households, spread out across 99 percent of U.S. counties. These, of course, represent only couples living together and who are politically aware enough to identify themselves on a Census form.

Certainly, you’ll find some of the most visibly identified gay neighborhoods — complete with plenty of commerce targeting gay consumers — in Manhattan and other large cities. But gay communities and the individuals who make them up come in all forms. I’ve covered sexual politics and sexual health from Jackson, Mississippi, to Harare, Zimbabwe. I’ve met proud, openly gay-identified people who are building communities in nearly every one of the dozens of places I’ve traveled or reported from.

But Mr. Esposito’s question suggests a deeper issue than numbers. Why should others care about gay people and our lives? The simple answer is, of course, that we are your neighbors and family members and part of the inescapably collective enterprise of living in and developing our cities. And here’s the thing: We have a great deal to offer in that process. Too often gay people and communities are discussed solely as problems to be addressed — political problems, health problems, hate-crime problems — Mr. Esposito’s “victimhood.” To be sure, there are problems to spare. Gay rights advocates have demanded, for instance, protection from being thrown out of our apartments because a landlord doesn’t like gay families; it remains perfectly legally to do so in many cities and states. But I’d argue all sides of the public conversation on sexuality — gay rights advocates included — have too often looked past the many incredible positive facts about both individual gay lives and the communities we have built. Gay politics got on the defensive long ago. A little offense could go a long way (though, I’m sure there’s a Beltway pollster ready to argue the contrary!).

What is the single biggest change you’ve seen in gay youth in the last 15 years?

— Posted by Victor Hoff

Conventional wisdom is that the biggest change is the age at which young people “come out” and identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. There certainly seems to be truth to that, though I think it would vary widely based on where you are and what support is available to you. For instance, Gay-Straight Alliance clubs — which are just what they sound like — have certainly blossomed in high schools around the country. But they remain clumped in relatively privileged, well-funded schools. School activists I’ve spoken to say that in the huge swath of already overwhelmed public schools, it’s near impossible to engage administrators on finding ways to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. Instead, they respond only once there has been a crisis — someone gets beat up (or worse), there’s a suicide or a gay student simply forces the issue by, say, bringing a date to the prom. So, again, we too often start with a problem when we should be supporting young people as they make active, healthy decisions about their lives.

Can you weigh in on the benefits and perils of adults in youth leadership roles (teachers, counselors, etc.) being openly out with their students? On one hand I imagine intangible benefits in teaching tolerance, acceptance and diversity. But it is not hard to imagine possible situations that would arise with more conservative parents, issues regarding the discussion of sex and sexuality with students, etc.

— Posted by Dave Mitchell

Personally, I think out gay educators offer students wonderful opportunities to learn not just about diversity but also the critical thinking it fosters. There are obvious political challenges, which stretch past sexual orientation. Teachers from all walks of life are too often discouraged from bringing their full selves to the classroom, to my mind. But I won’t wade too deeply into education policy, lest I show how little I know.

More broadly, I’ll say that adults working with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth consistently report their greatest challenge is people power: There just aren’t enough adults willing to enter into what are by any measure challenging relationships. The cross-generational communication challenges are enormous and filled with assumptions and misunderstandings on both sides. There’s just not a lot of trust between gay youth and adults, in part because there is so little contact between them.

In addition, the significant baggage many gay adults have with their own youth (who wants to go back there?) can make it difficult for some to step up to the challenge.

I’ve been deeply disturbed by the surge in HIV-infection rates among young gay men — not just in NYC, but nationwide. It seems like we’re going back to the bad old days, after making so much progress in getting everyone to practice safe sex back in the ’80s and ’90s. In your estimation, what’s driving this? Complacency brought on by the availability of new drug therapies? The flood of “bareback” pornography? Old-line organizations that used to target this community but now have other priorities — and possibly no longer the ability to speak to young gay men effectively?

I’m doing my own part to turn things around, starting an organization of young gay men to do peer-to-peer outreach in social/new media to get it back in the daily conversation and dispel the myth of HIV being “no big deal” to live with… but is there one root cause that’s deeper than the others? And is anyone in the city besides Harlem United doing any energetic, active outreach to combat the resurgence of HIV? I’ve been disheartened by the efforts (or lack thereof) from other groups that should be on top of this!

— Posted by Dave

I have to say that there’s actually been enormous concern in the past several years, within public health and among HIV service providers, about the growing rates of infection among young gay and bisexual men, and particularly among black men. The lack of concern lies with elected officials, because first and foremost, there’s just plainly not enough money available, for this or any other part of our response to the epidemic. There are now more people living with HIV in the U.S. than ever before, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates a fifth of them have no idea they are infected. That’s a pretty good way to keep the party going.

Several Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studies have shown that young gay men — and, again, young gay men of color particularly — are even more unlikely to be aware of their infections. So part of the problem is simple: We need to spend far more resources getting people tested and connecting them with care when they’re positive.

But I strongly disagree with the growing meme that young gay men shrug off HIV. There’s no empirical evidence of it and I’ve seen no sign of it in either my reporting or my personal life. In fact, surveys show that gay men in New York City are more likely to use condoms than any other population. The same is true for black gay men nationally, despite the fact that infections are rising most rapidly among black men. There are some simple, unavoidable truths that are far less sexy but much more important. One is biology: Unprotected, receptive anal sex offers HIV an easier way into the body than any other kind of intercourse. The presence of an untreated STD makes it even easier. So if you’re having anal sex and not able or willing to talk to a doctor about it, it’s a recipe for disaster. Another reality is social: The more tight-knit a sexual network, the more rapidly a virus can spread through it. Some researchers believe this is part of the explanation for high infection rates in black communities, both gay and straight — that African Americans are more likely to have small, overlapping circles of sex partners. That would translate to young people too, it seems to me.

Here’s the bigger picture. In order to create a sustainable HIV prevention plan, we must people smart and give them easy access to the services they need to be healthy and eliminate scare-tactics.

What do you consider the most interesting and important LGBT organizations working today in the city, with youth or more generally? How about more nationally?

— Posted by Emily Hobson

There are several, but here are three service providers (as opposed to advocacy groups) that I spent time with in New York City while reporting Drifting Toward Love, and that either myself or friends have volunteered for:

The Ali Forney Center — It provides housing for homeless gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth, the vast majority of them youth of color. What’s nice is it’s not just a bed and a roof; they have a large suite of programs to support their young folks in getting the skills they need to build healthy lives as adults. Again, it’s moving away from fixing problems and toward supporting talents.

LiveOutLoud — It recruits lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults to speak at high schools and other venues about their lives. It’s nice because it’s simple: Just get out gay folks to stand up and say they exist and they’re doing well. And it’s done in the context of a general class, so it’s not just pulling aside the gay kids to listen. It’s also an easy commitment: All you gotta do is go speak.

The Hetrick-Martin Institute — One of the first and most well-known, both here in the city and nationally. It’s most known for the Harvey Milk School, a high school for youth who’ve otherwise left school because of — well, a lot of reasons (bullying, homelessness, depression, behavior problems that grow out of all of the above). But the Institute has a big list of services, ranging from a free lunch to reading groups.

The New York Times,‘The Invisible Cure’,"For more than twenty years, scientists have been trying to make such a vaccine, and most experts predict it will take at least another decade. The editor of Britain's prestigious medical journal The Lancet has even suggested that a truly effective AIDS vaccine may be a biological impossibility.

I continued to work on AIDS as a writer and consultant for various development agencies after I left Uganda, and I continued to wonder about what might be done to arrest the epidemic, and whether some other device or program might substitute for a vaccine. In 1996, a combination of three antiretroviral drugs, taken for life, was found to dramatically relieve the symptoms and extend the lives of HIV-positive people. At the time, these drugs were patented and extremely expensive, and for years they were out of reach of the millions of poor African patients who needed them. Before long, a worldwide network of AIDS activists began to pressure pharmaceutical companies to cut the prices of these drugs and urged international donors to raise billions of dollars to fund AIDS treatment programs in developing countries. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Africans with HIV are now receiving treatment.

In this book, I do not deal at length with this extraordinary struggle, a story that has been ably covered by other writers, some of whom are activists themselves. While the humanitarian urgency of AIDS treatment programs is inarguable, these drugs will not halt the epidemic on their own. They are not a cure, they don't work for everyone, and they can have severe side effects. In Africa, those most likely to spread the virus to others are often at an early stage of infection and are not in need of treatment. In many cases, their infections may not even be detectable by HIV tests. Because Africa's health-care infrastructure is in such a dire state, treatment programs are expensive and difficult to administer, even when the drugs themselves are practically free. Those who do receive treatment can expect to gain, on average, only an extra four or five years of life because the virus eventually develops resistance, necessitating second- and third-line treatment, presently all but unavailable in Africa. It is impossible to put a price on four years of anyone's life, least of all that of an African mother whose children would otherwise be orphaned, so the international community must endeavor to expand the range of AIDS drugs available in Africa. However, it would be better by far if that mother had never become infected in the first place.

To date, the closest thing to a vaccine to prevent HIV is male circumcision, which was shown in 2006 to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by roughly 50 percent. The widespread practice of male circumcision in the predominantly Muslim countries of West Africa may largely explain why the virus is so much less common there than it is along the eastern and southern rim of the continent. It is urgent that as many men as are willing to undergo the procedure have access to cheap, safe circumcision services. But it may take years to develop such services and in the meantime, millions of people will become infected. In any case, HIV infection rates may be quite high, even in West African cities where nearly all men are circumcised.

As international concern about the epidemic has grown, along with foreign-aid budgets for programs to fight it, a global archipelago of governmental and nongovernmental agencies has emerged to channel money, consultants, condoms, and other commodities to AIDS programs all over the world. During the past decade, I have visited dozens of these programs and spoken to hundreds of people. I never found a panacea, but I did learn a great deal. I learned, for example, that AIDS is a social problem as much as it is a medical one; that the virus is of recent origin, but that its spread has been worsened by an explosive combination of historically rooted patterns of sexual behavior, the vicissitudes of postcolonial development, and economic globalization that has left millions of African people adrift in an increasingly unequal world. Their poverty and social dislocation have generated an earthquake in gender relations that has created wide-open channels for the spread of HIV. Most important, I came to understand that when it comes to saving lives, intangible things-the solidarity of ordinary people facing up to a shared calamity; the anger of activists, especially women; and new scientific ideas-can be just as important as medicine and technology.

Like many newcomers to Africa, I learned early on that the most successful AIDS projects tended to be conceived and run by Africans themselves or by missionaries and aid workers with long experience in Africa-in other words, by people who really knew the culture. The key to their success resided in something for which the public health field currently has no name or program. It is best described as a sense of solidarity, compassion, and mutual aid that brings people together to solve a common problem that individuals can't solve on their own. The closest thing to it might be Harvard sociologist Felton Earls's concept of ""collective efficacy,"" meaning the capacity of people to come together and help others they are not necessarily related to. Where missionaries and aid workers have, intentionally or not, suppressed this spirit, the results have been disappointing. Where they have built on these qualities, their efforts have often succeeded remarkably well.

It's easy to be pessimistic about Africa. Headlines from the continent chronicle apparently endless war, tyranny, corruption, famine, and natural disaster, along with a few isolated nature reserves and other beauty spots. Certainly there are many war-torn countries in Africa and many poor, sick people who need assistance. But sometimes helplessness is in the eye of the beholder. There is also another Africa, characterized by a striking degree of reciprocity, solidarity, and ingenuity. Time and again, African people have relied on these qualities to save themselves-and at one time, the entire human family-from extinction. Now, faced with the scourge of AIDS, some of them, including the farmer I met in Kenya, are trying to do so again.

Most of the black Africans who now live in the region covered in this book are descended from Bantu farmers who began migrating from western Africa several thousand years ago, across the continent and then south. On the way, some of them encountered other African population groups-the San and Khoi of southern Africa and the Nilotes of the Sahel, for example-with whom they exchanged aspects of language and culture and with whom they sometimes intermarried. Subgroups splintered off from each other and adapted to local circumstances.

Their story is, with some exceptions, not about the accumulation of great personal fortunes and the founding of cities with palaces, cathedrals, and libraries. It is a story of relatively small groups banding together to survive on a harsh and dangerous frontier, of natural disasters and political and economic crises.

Survival was not inevitable. The ancient, infertile soils of Africa could not sustain large permanent farming settlements, and the development of towns was further prevented by infectious diseases that spread rapidly as soon as populations reached a certain threshold. When farmers cleared large tracts of land to grow crops, malaria bloomed in the sunlit mud; as herds expanded, the animals succumbed to tuberculosis and sleeping sickness, which spread to their owners.

Faced with such a mutable, dangerous world, the people of East and southern Africa developed a genius for local improvisation, adapting to life in forests, deserts, or lakesides. Cut off by the Sahara from the developing technologies of Europe and Asia, they were forced to innovate and developed their own methods of agriculture, iron smelting, and mining. In a world without the apparent consolations of property and bureaucratic institutions, a powerful sense of spirituality provided moral order and solace to the suffering. Few groups developed writing, but they relied on drumming, the patterns woven into cloth and beadwork, and their prodigious memories to transmit information and an ever-changing repertoire of stories and myths.

On the harsh African frontier, you were nowhere without other people, and this is still the case, even though the crises facing the continent are very different and constantly changing. It is almost impossible to be truly alone in Africa, and this has a profound effect on how people see the world and act in it. In remote villages, the poorest families will invite strangers into their houses and won't let them leave until they have eaten an enormous meal. Most Africans I know live in households that swarm with a vast and changing cast of inhabitants, including grown offspring, nieces, nephews, poor relations, aged aunts and uncles, and innumerable children. You would need a spreadsheet to establish who is related to whom and how.

These societies, wrote the historian Basil Davidson, ""enclosed relations between people within a moral framework of intimately binding force.... an intense and daily interdependence that we in our day seldom recognize, except in moments of postprandial afflatus or national catastrophe. The good of the individual was a function of the good of the community, not the reverse.""

This sense of solidarity has a downside when it contributes to tribalism and social rigidity, but it can also be a source of power and creativity, and it has been at the heart of the region's most successful responses to AIDS.

What I didn't know when I was in Uganda in the early 1990s was that something remarkable was happening there. Between 1992 and 1997, the HIV infection rate fell by some 60 percent in the arc of territory along the northern and western shores of Lake Victoria, an area comprising southern Uganda and the remote Kagera region of Tanzania. This success, unique on the continent at the time, saved perhaps a million lives. It was not attributable to a pill or a vaccine or any particular public health program, but to a social movement in which everyone-politicians, preachers, women's rights activists, local and international health officials, ordinary farmers, and slum dwellers-was extraordinarily pragmatic and candid about the disaster unfolding in their midst. This response was similar to the spontaneous, compassionate, and angry AIDS activism of gay men in Western countries during the 1980s, when HIV incidence in this group also fell steeply. Why has such a response been so slow to emerge elsewhere? The complete answer may never be known, but in this book, I suggest that outside of Uganda and Kagera, health officials misunderstood the nature of the AIDS epidemic in this region, in particular why the virus was spreading so rapidly in the general population. As a result, the programs they introduced were less effective than they might have been and may have inadvertently reinforced the stigma, shame, and prejudice surrounding the disease. The AIDS epidemic is finally beginning to subside in many African countries, owing to increasing awareness and commonsense changes in sexual behavior. This is heartening, but it is possible that many lives might have been spared had policymakers better understood the nature of the epidemic early on.

Much of this book is concerned with donor-funded AIDS programs that failed in some way, beginning with my own vaccine project. I tell these stories not with a sense of satisfaction. I could not have done better myself at the time. But in science, failures are often as important as successes, because they tell us where the limits are. Only by looking honestly at our mistakes can we hope to overcome them. When it comes to fighting AIDS, our greatest mistake may have been to overlook the fact that, in spite of everything, African people often know best how to solve their own problems. They have been doing so throughout human history. Had they not succeeded, I would not be here to write these words, nor would you be here to read them.

This is your typical NY Times “agenda” article that is exclusively a Manhattan topic for discussion. Get real – there are more important issues that affect our daily lives than the supposed victimhood by individuals who base their existence on the sexual orientation and choice of lifestyle in the epicenter of American liberalism, NYC.

— Posted by William L. Esposito

This seems a good place to start. Mr. Esposito raises questions that, frankly, come up a great deal, particularly in communities of color and in families outside of major cities. They are worth addressing in a bit of detail.

The first implicit question is a straightforward numerical one. The U.S. Census Bureau does not tally people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, so there is no hard data on the community or where it lives. Advocates campaigned hard to add a sexual orientation question to the 2010 Census, but the census makes such changes quite slowly. We can tally the number of same-sex households, since that can be gathered from same-sex household members who check the partner box under relationship. The 2000 Census identified roughly 600,000 such households, spread out across 99 percent of U.S. counties. These, of course, represent only couples living together and who are politically aware enough to identify themselves on a Census form.

Certainly, you’ll find some of the most visibly identified gay neighborhoods — complete with plenty of commerce targeting gay consumers — in Manhattan and other large cities. But gay communities and the individuals who make them up come in all forms. I’ve covered sexual politics and sexual health from Jackson, Mississippi, to Harare, Zimbabwe. I’ve met proud, openly gay-identified people who are building communities in nearly every one of the dozens of places I’ve traveled or reported from.

But Mr. Esposito’s question suggests a deeper issue than numbers. Why should others care about gay people and our lives? The simple answer is, of course, that we are your neighbors and family members and part of the inescapably collective enterprise of living in and developing our cities. And here’s the thing: We have a great deal to offer in that process. Too often gay people and communities are discussed solely as problems to be addressed — political problems, health problems, hate-crime problems — Mr. Esposito’s “victimhood.” To be sure, there are problems to spare. Gay rights advocates have demanded, for instance, protection from being thrown out of our apartments because a landlord doesn’t like gay families; it remains perfectly legally to do so in many cities and states. But I’d argue all sides of the public conversation on sexuality — gay rights advocates included — have too often looked past the many incredible positive facts about both individual gay lives and the communities we have built. Gay politics got on the defensive long ago. A little offense could go a long way (though, I’m sure there’s a Beltway pollster ready to argue the contrary!).

What is the single biggest change you’ve seen in gay youth in the last 15 years?

— Posted by Victor Hoff

Conventional wisdom is that the biggest change is the age at which young people “come out” and identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. There certainly seems to be truth to that, though I think it would vary widely based on where you are and what support is available to you. For instance, Gay-Straight Alliance clubs — which are just what they sound like — have certainly blossomed in high schools around the country. But they remain clumped in relatively privileged, well-funded schools. School activists I’ve spoken to say that in the huge swath of already overwhelmed public schools, it’s near impossible to engage administrators on finding ways to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. Instead, they respond only once there has been a crisis — someone gets beat up (or worse), there’s a suicide or a gay student simply forces the issue by, say, bringing a date to the prom. So, again, we too often start with a problem when we should be supporting young people as they make active, healthy decisions about their lives.

Can you weigh in on the benefits and perils of adults in youth leadership roles (teachers, counselors, etc.) being openly out with their students? On one hand I imagine intangible benefits in teaching tolerance, acceptance and diversity. But it is not hard to imagine possible situations that would arise with more conservative parents, issues regarding the discussion of sex and sexuality with students, etc.

Personally, I think out gay educators offer students wonderful opportunities to learn not just about diversity but also the critical thinking it fosters. There are obvious political challenges, which stretch past sexual orientation. Teachers from all walks of life are too often discouraged from bringing their full selves to the classroom, to my mind. But I won’t wade too deeply into education policy, lest I show how little I know.

More broadly, I’ll say that adults working with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth consistently report their greatest challenge is people power: There just aren’t enough adults willing to enter into what are by any measure challenging relationships. The cross-generational communication challenges are enormous and filled with assumptions and misunderstandings on both sides. There’s just not a lot of trust between gay youth and adults, in part because there is so little contact between them.

In addition, the significant baggage many gay adults have with their own youth (who wants to go back there?) can make it difficult for some to step up to the challenge.

I’ve been deeply disturbed by the surge in HIV-infection rates among young gay men — not just in NYC, but nationwide. It seems like we’re going back to the bad old days, after making so much progress in getting everyone to practice safe sex back in the ’80s and ’90s. In your estimation, what’s driving this? Complacency brought on by the availability of new drug therapies? The flood of “bareback” pornography? Old-line organizations that used to target this community but now have other priorities — and possibly no longer the ability to speak to young gay men effectively?

I’m doing my own part to turn things around, starting an organization of young gay men to do peer-to-peer outreach in social/new media to get it back in the daily conversation and dispel the myth of HIV being “no big deal” to live with… but is there one root cause that’s deeper than the others? And is anyone in the city besides Harlem United doing any energetic, active outreach to combat the resurgence of HIV? I’ve been disheartened by the efforts (or lack thereof) from other groups that should be on top of this!

— Posted by Dave

I have to say that there’s actually been enormous concern in the past several years, within public health and among HIV service providers, about the growing rates of infection among young gay and bisexual men, and particularly among black men. The lack of concern lies with elected officials, because first and foremost, there’s just plainly not enough money available, for this or any other part of our response to the epidemic. There are now more people living with HIV in the U.S. than ever before, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates a fifth of them have no idea they are infected. That’s a pretty good way to keep the party going.

Several Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studies have shown that young gay men — and, again, young gay men of color particularly — are even more unlikely to be aware of their infections. So part of the problem is simple: We need to spend far more resources getting people tested and connecting them with care when they’re positive.

But I strongly disagree with the growing meme that young gay men shrug off HIV. There’s no empirical evidence of it and I’ve seen no sign of it in either my reporting or my personal life. In fact, surveys show that gay men in New York City are more likely to use condoms than any other population. The same is true for black gay men nationally, despite the fact that infections are rising most rapidly among black men. There are some simple, unavoidable truths that are far less sexy but much more important. One is biology: Unprotected, receptive anal sex offers HIV an easier way into the body than any other kind of intercourse. The presence of an untreated STD makes it even easier. So if you’re having anal sex and not able or willing to talk to a doctor about it, it’s a recipe for disaster. Another reality is social: The more tight-knit a sexual network, the more rapidly a virus can spread through it. Some researchers believe this is part of the explanation for high infection rates in black communities, both gay and straight — that African Americans are more likely to have small, overlapping circles of sex partners. That would translate to young people too, it seems to me.

Here’s the bigger picture. In order to create a sustainable HIV prevention plan, we must people smart and give them easy access to the services they need to be healthy and eliminate scare-tactics.

What do you consider the most interesting and important LGBT organizations working today in the city, with youth or more generally? How about more nationally?

— Posted by Emily Hobson

There are several, but here are three service providers (as opposed to advocacy groups) that I spent time with in New York City while reporting Drifting Toward Love, and that either myself or friends have volunteered for:

The Ali Forney Center — It provides housing for homeless gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth, the vast majority of them youth of color. What’s nice is it’s not just a bed and a roof; they have a large suite of programs to support their young folks in getting the skills they need to build healthy lives as adults. Again, it’s moving away from fixing problems and toward supporting talents.

LiveOutLoud — It recruits lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults to speak at high schools and other venues about their lives. It’s nice because it’s simple: Just get out gay folks to stand up and say they exist and they’re doing well. And it’s done in the context of a general class, so it’s not just pulling aside the gay kids to listen. It’s also an easy commitment: All you gotta do is go speak.

The Hetrick-Martin Institute — One of the first and most well-known, both here in the city and nationally. It’s most known for the Harvey Milk School, a high school for youth who’ve otherwise left school because of — well, a lot of reasons (bullying, homelessness, depression, behavior problems that grow out of all of the above). But the Institute has a big list of services, ranging from a free lunch to reading groups.

The New York Times,When Prabal Met Maggie,"Ben Gabbe/Getty Images

There’s no disputing the socialite bona fides of Maggie Betts, the daughter of the film producer and Chelsea Piers developer Roland Betts and a fixture of Gotham’s party scene. But Betts, a 36-year-old Princeton graduate, is also a passionate advocate for AIDS awareness in Africa who has spent long periods on the continent bearing witness to the epidemic. Her first film, “The Carrier,” which premieres Thursday as part of the Tribeca Film Festival, is the culmination of five years of research. The documentary tells the story of a Zambian woman, Mutinta Mweemba, who tries desperately not to pass on her HIV infection to her unborn child. Here, Betts is interviewed by the designer Prabal Gurung, her good friend and the recently appointed Goodwill Ambassador for the nonprofit group Maiti Nepal.

Prabal Gurung: What was the force and motivation behind making this film? And why film versus all other mediums out there?

Maggie Betts: I’ve been obsessed with movies my whole life and have always dreamed of making a film – somehow this particular idea, this particular issue finally motivated me enough to convince myself I had to do it. I know you had a similar experience, the way you almost woke up one moment and said, “That’s it, I’m starting my own line.” I think there’s a moment when you finally get sick of thinking and talking about something and you realize you just have go for it, regardless of the outcome. I also felt that the larger message of the film was so valid and meaningful and important to try and share, it was worth my taking a risk for.

Gurung: What was your initial reasoning behind making this documentary? Was there one particular message you wanted to get across that prompted you to begin creating this film?

Betts: My starting point was really just learning about P.M.T.C.T. [Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission] and the extraordinary potential it now holds toward seeing a new HIV-free generation in Africa. I started to learn that there were all these anonymous young HIV-positive pregnant women, all engaged in this heroic act of trying to protect their unborn babies from HIV, all across the continent. And I felt it was something that not a lot of people were aware of but would probably be very moved and inspired by once they learned. There’s just something so profound about the larger idea of P.M.T.C.T.: the idea that there’s this new sort of battleground taking place in the fight against AIDS in Africa, and it all starts with something as simple and universal as a mother’s inbred love of her child.

Gurung: Your character Mutinta is fascinating for a viewer to watch and in many ways is the epitome of a strong yet graceful woman. She really moves the message across. What was it about her and in what ways did she speak to you emotionally?

Betts: There are certain people in your life that you meet that just leave an indelible mark on you forever. I consider myself very proud and so incredibly blessed to say that Mutinta Mweemba, this young subsistence farmer whom we met and interviewed one November day in rural Zambia, who then became the film’s protagonist as well as a sort of living embodiment of all the larger themes in the story, really is that person for me. I cannot express how one individual can sort of represent and really “carry” within themselves, within her heart and her steadfast strength and determination, so many larger ideas and values that I wanted to express through the film. She is, in my mind, the epitome of a heroine, and that really has to do with the impossibly heroic way in which she confronts and deals with all the challenges of her life. I truly look up to and admire her for who she is, perhaps more than any other person I’ve ever met.

Gurung: I feel that as of late there is a definite shift in some corners of society where people of privilege are using their platform to address bigger issues. Where do you think this is coming from, and have you seen an evident shift amongst your peers?

Betts: You and I have talked about this a lot, and I agree and am excited by this kind of shift that we both feel taking place around us, maybe like a tiny zeitgeist change, wherein people our age seem to be becoming more and more socially aware, more interested and compelled by larger issues beyond themselves. I think there are always these slow but constant pendulum shifts in America, sometimes decades long, but I’ve noticed one take place in our recent time period. It’s like a shift from this very sort of insular, self-involved view point into a kind of new mindset of being more curious and engaged by these larger issues taking place in our world. I suppose I’m very in sync with my generation in that way, or at least want to be.

Gurung: Typically a documentary with such a strong message and one that speaks to something as serious as P.M.T.C.T. can be incredibly dark and raw. Your film has a poetic, almost lyrical feel to it, with significant aesthetic appeal. You create a juxtaposition between beautiful imagery and a deeply consequential issue. How did this evolve throughout the process?

Betts: I am an extremely visual and deeply aesthetic person, not unlike yourself. Before even coming to the idea of this particular story, I knew that if I was ever going to make a film, I wanted it to be absolutely stunning to look at, and to really envelop its audience in a very lush-feeling visual atmosphere. I also worked very hard with our director of photography, Kat Westergaard, who’s an incredibly talented person at creating a specific look and visual language for the film. Almost every frame had some sort of unique and photographic element taking place within it. It didn’t hurt that the specific location we were shooting in – Monze, Zambia – was also one of the most breathtaking places I’ve ever been. And the people were just so jaw-droppingly beautiful as well, both in their faces and in their spirits and absolute determination to overcome obstacles.

The New York Times,An Artful Homage to Roller Disco,"When Hauser & Wirth moved into its Dieter Roth-designed West 18th Street space two years ago, the gallery inherited an unexpected treasure trove: hundreds of roller skates left over from the former tenant, the famous Roxy roller disco. With the opening of Mark Bradford’s new exhibition, “Be Strong Boquan,” this past weekend, the history of the building comes back to life. Immediately upon entering the show, visitors encounter “Deimos,” a video installation depicting dozens of the little orange wheels from the Roxy’s skates, spinning from one end of the frame to the other. T premieres the video exclusively here (in the gallery, it’s displayed across three screens on one very long wall).

“Deimos” is playful and exuberant — but carries with it a sense of what’s missing. Themes of lack and loss resonate throughout the exhibition, which uses a variety of media to explore the politics of race and queerness, as well as the AIDS epidemic. (A standout series of canvases on display, which appear at first glance to be abstract compositions, were in fact loosely inspired by the molecular composition of human cells — including Kaposi’s sarcoma, the cancer that causes lesions in those infected with HIV.) In creating “Deimos,” Bradford explains, “I just really started to think about the Roxy and how we lost so many people around that time. The play between something super violent and something super beautiful: that’s where it came out of.”

Before Bradford created the video, Hauser & Wirth shipped him the skates, and he’d been surrounded by them in his studio for some time — “I hung them from things, it was great,” he says — but he couldn’t figure out how to incorporate them into his work. “And then I just thought, ‘The wheel! It’s all about the wheel anyway,’” he says. “As I was doing it, I noticed that sometimes the wheels would animate and you’d start to feel that they became people. And I thought, ‘Oh, they’ll create their own narratives.’”

In considering how to present the video, scale became symbolic. “Early language around the epidemic was almost epic, it was insane, it was like Biblical proportions,” he says. “A lot of the language around HIV was almost created, invented in popular culture. So I wanted to have a cinematic feel to it. And this idea of a cinema, which is dark, and the roller rink that’s dark — whizzing through these dark spaces and being free and anonymous.” The video is soundtracked by a version of the 1988 disco hit “Grateful,” which Bradford has slowed to a more contemplative tempo. Bradford knew its singer, the androgynous West Coast counterculture icon Sylvester, who died of AIDS in 1988. “I actually sat next to Sylvester at Catch One in Los Angeles, and she was done up and furred out, but you could tell she wasn’t well; it was one of the last times she was out,” he says. “I remember her very clearly. Sylvester had a big fox coat on and she would get on the dance floor and just twirl. Work, honey, work!”",09/11/2015
The New York Times,"Barton Lidice Benes, Provocative Artist, Dies at 69","Barton Lidice Benes, a New York sculptor who worked in materials that he called artifacts of everyday life, expanded his definition of “everyday” as he went. He used the everyday mementos of childhood in his early work, and later made sculptures from chopped up, everyday American cash (purchased pre-shredded from the Federal Reserve).

When friends started dying of AIDS, and Mr. Benes himself tested HIV-positive, he began working in everyday materials of the epidemic — pills and capsules, intravenous tubes, HIV-infected blood and cremated human remains.

Mr. Benes, who died of acute kidney failure on May 30 at 69, created a body of work that was exhibited internationally and included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Smithsonian.

His work dealing with the AIDS epidemic was acclaimed for its raw approach to death. Some of it was so raw that he had difficulty finding art galleries willing to show it. Among his best known works — though it was never exhibited publicly — was his collection of memento mori filling his 850-square-foot Greenwich Village apartment and studio floor to ceiling: thousands of artifacts like tribal masks, animal skeletons, taxidermy, religious relics, voodoo dolls and a stockpile of celebrity ephemera. He called it “my tomb.”

The North Dakota Museum of Art in Grand Forks, which in the early 1990s showed controversial artworks of his that no other galleries would, plans to build a replica of his apartment and furnish it exactly as Mr. Benes left it. Among its objects, many of them macabre, are a blackened human toe; a giant hourglass holding the mingled ashes of two of Mr. Benes’s friends, partners who died of AIDS; a gall stone removed from his friend Larry Hagman, the actor; and a stuffed giraffe’s head.

The New York Times,AIDS Documentary May Become ABC Miniseries,"The acclaimed documentary “How to Survive a Plague,” about the genesis of the AIDS epidemic, could become a television miniseries. The Hollywood Reporter said Thursday that ABC Studios, a production company owned by the Disney/ABC Television Group, had bought the rights to the documentary so it could develop a dramatic miniseries about HIV-positive young men who, as the title implies, beat the medical odds.

David France, who co-wrote and directed the documentary, said, “We’d like it to be an extended story that’s not just about AIDS and what AIDS wrought, but about this tremendous civil rights movement that grew from the ashes of AIDS and the dawn of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movement.” He said that ABC Studios was a logical home for such a miniseries: “ABC is the network of ‘Roots.’”

“How to Survive a Plague” was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature, but lost last Sunday to “Searching for Sugar Man.”",28/02/2013
The New York Times,Finding a Home in the Bronx After Fleeing Anti-Gay Violence in Haiti,"A makeup artist for eight years, he had worked at “Journal de Loisirs,” a celebrity talk show, and often carried a purse and makeup bag to the office. Seven months before the stabbing, Mr. Joseph said, he was kidnapped from his workplace, hooded and taken to an abandoned home, where he was chained to a pole and beaten. Three men threatened to kill him, he said, and called him an embarrassment to his country. They later let him go.

“I always felt threatened,” he said. “And I never said anything back to these people. I was afraid of a violent response. There was always a fear.”

After the 2012 attack, Mr. Joseph applied for a tourist visa to the United States, hoping the country would be as welcoming as it was portrayed on the television shows he had watched as a child, he said.

“It was always my dream country,” Mr. Joseph said. “America is where you can make happen the dreams you envision for yourself.”

He arrived in April 2013 on a tourist visa and settled in New York City. A few weeks later, he attended his first party since the attack, at the Monster, a piano bar in the West Village. Feeling safe, he took the stage to sing “Lumane Casimir,” a well-known Haitian song.

The New York Times,The Lazarus Effect,"The “miraculous” effect of antiretroviral drugs on Africans suffering from AIDS.

Writing for CNN, Eric Marrapodi reported:

They were left for dead in Africa. Gaunt, skin and bones; AIDS patients with hollow eyes. But a month later they are healthy, smiling and brimming with life after a series of pills that costs about 40 cents a day.

Doctors and relief workers call it “The Lazarus Effect,” referring to the biblical miracle in the Gospel of John in which Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.

According to Marrapodi, “The Lazarus Effect” is also the title of a documentary by director Lance Bangs:

On Sunday, hundreds of churches around the country will be screening clips from Bangs’ Lazarus documentary to raise awareness of a medical miracle their congregants can take part in.

The movement is called Lazarus Sunday and is spearheaded by ONE, an advocacy and campaigning group co-founded by Bono that fights against extreme poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa.",19/04/2011

She added that Mr. Johnson, as a gay man who is HIV-positive, could understand some of the issues facing minorities, a sentiment that was echoed by Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez of Manhattan, another speaker candidate.

Mr. Johnson carefully acknowledged the remarks.

“There is no way for me to say I can fully relate to the experience of being a person of color in New York City,” he said. “But as someone who’s an openly gay man, who’s openly HIV-positive, who did not grow up in a family with a lot of money, I think that experience gives me some more sensitivity.”

Mr. Johnson said he would call on the diversity of the body to address various issues.

“When there are issues related to race in New York City … I don’t need to be the main spokesperson,” he said.

The New York Times,U.N. Chief Says World Is Losing Battle With AIDS,"The dark tone of Mr. Annan's remarks diverged markedly from the upbeat speeches by world leaders at the start of the 3-day session on Wednesday, and from the positive speech given immediately before his remarks by Laura Bush, the first lady.

""This is a hopeful moment in the fight against AIDS,"" Mrs. Bush began. She noted that the administration of her husband, President Bush, began a program in 2003 to contribute a total of $15 billion over 5 years to the international fight against AIDS.

""The American people are on track to meet or exceed that commitment,"" she said.

Not enough, Mr. Annan — the next speaker — seemed to say, as Mrs. Bush listened from the front row. ""This fight requires every president, every parliamentarian to say, 'AIDS stops with me,' "" he said.

The United States, the host country for the special session, has been roundly criticized by AIDS activists around the world for dispatching Mrs. Bush as its representative at the session, rather than a senior administration official. France and Brazil sent their foreign ministers, for example, and many African presidents are in attendance.

Mrs. Bush's 5-minute speech steered away from many of the criticisms that have been leveled against the United States's international AIDS policy, most notably that it seeks to promote sexual abstinence rather than scientifically proven approaches to stemming the spread of the virus, particularly condom use.

""The U.S. funds abstinence or abstinence-until-marriage programs that are ideologically driven and have nothing to do with reality,"" said Jodi Jacobson, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equality, an American advocacy group. ""In a lot of places, teenagers are sexually active and married women are getting infected from their husbands.""

Ms. Jacobson noted that at this week's session, American delegates pushed for the removal of phrases like ""sex workers"" or ""men who have sex with men"" from conference documents, preferring to refer to ""vulnerable groups"" instead. The United States has sided with Syria and Yemen in refusing to talk about ""the empowerment of girls,"" she said.

Ms. Bush did not address such controversies. She made passing reference to the official U.N. program for AIDS prevention — known as ABC, short for Abstinence, Be-Faithful, and Condom use — by noting that ""Africa's ABC model has led to dramatic declines in HIV"" in some countries.

Mrs. Bush also suggested the creation of an international HIV testing day, and spoke of the way that wider availability of anti-AIDS drugs allowed people with HIV ""a second chance at life.""

But the three U.N. officials who spoke after Ms, Bush, including Mr. Annan, said that far too few people in Africa had access to such drugs, and that the U.N. was desperately short of the money needed to improve the situation.

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria, a war chest of money created after the 2001 conference, has helped more than 500,000 people to receive lifesaving cocktails of antiviral drugs, a number that has grown by 40 percent in the last 6 months.

But the World Health Organization estimates that as few as 1 in 6 people infected with HIV are able to get such drugs, because of the high cost.

The U.N. estimates that it needs $18 billion to combat AIDS in 2007 and $22 billion in 2008. At present, it has commitments for less than half that amount, according to Dr. Richard Feachem, head of the Global Fund.

""Public and private funding needs to be greatly expanded,"" Dr. Feachem said. ""Let all countries contribute fully, according to their means.""",02/06/2006
The New York Times,"Biden v. Giuliani, Another Round","While you were out trick-or-treating last night, the great Biden-Giuliani debate of 2007 continued apace.

Luis Navarro, Joe Biden’s campaign manager, sent this out last night: “Rudy Giuliani seems to be increasingly worried that Joe Biden is questioning his lack of leadership and his use of 9/11 for his own political purposes. This criticism is grounded in reality: there are numerous examples of Mr. Giuliani using 9/11 as a substitute for real experience and real answers to important topics.’’

Then, another needle: “In the spirit of Halloween, Rudy, if the dress fits, wear it.’’

The Biden campaign passed along these citations:

Giuliani on…Accomplishing our Goals in Iraq. Giuliani said, “Maybe it’s because I was mayor of America’s largest city and I was mayor of America’s largest city during periods of crisis. You know about September 11th. So, to me, when I look at Iraq what I look to is, how well and how effectively are we keeping the civilian order functioning in the right way.

The New York Times,AIDS Group Opposes Frieden for C.D.C.,"Responding to a report in The Wall Street Journal that Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, New York City’s health commissioner, is being considered for a possible appointment as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Housing Works, a leading organization for people with H.I.V. and AIDS, on Wednesday urged the Obama administration to pick someone else.

The organization’s president and chief executive, Charles King, said in a statement:

Appointing Commissioner Frieden to the top post at the CDC would be a devastating blow to combating HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as other chronic illnesses that require complex public health solutions and involvement from local communities. Throughout his tenure as New York City Health Commissioner, Frieden has simultaneously employed an authoritarian, my-way-or-the-highway approach and an unabashed secretiveness undignified of a public servant. He has excluded AIDS groups wherever possible from having input into life-and-death AIDS funding, testing and care policymaking decisions.

The Health Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Housing Works statement.

This is not the first time Housing Works has clashed with Dr. Frieden.

In February 2005, when Dr. Frieden announced the discovery of a possibly new and deadly H.I.V. strain, some scientists dismissed the news as isolated to one man and unworthy of alarm, other scientists said not enough research had been done to warrant a public health announcement, and activists worried Dr. Frieden’s emphasize safe-sex practices would set up gay men as culprits.

Housing Works said in a statement:

Notwithstanding strong objections from New York City’s extensive community-based AIDS services network, Frieden sought to persuade New York State legislators to make sweeping changes to the state’s HIV-testing policies, including the elimination of written consent and pre- and post-test counseling. He also attempted to divert AIDS funding away from community-based AIDS organizations toward large hospitals and ignored the need for basic services, such as housing, that allow low-income people to remain medically adherent. Frieden’s efforts proved his indifference to the profound stigma attached to AIDS and his ignorance of the critical role supportive services provided by community-based organizations play in the health of people living with the disease. Frieden also sought sweeping access to medical records of people living with HIV/AIDS and diabetics with insufficient consideration to the damage that the revelation of personal health information could pose for individuals.

After reading the news release by Housing Works, Dr. Roy M. Gulick, chief of the division of infectious diseases at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, called The Times to defend Dr. Frieden. Dr. Gulick said in a phone interview:

I think Tom Frieden has done an enormous amount for H.I.V.-infected people in New York City. He’s increased community services over the time he’s been commissioner. He’s emphasized prevention. He’s promoted needle exchange and condom use. He’s promoted testing so there are more New Yorkers aware of their status. I think the community and the city know that this is a guy who’s made a big difference, through the Department of Health, for people living with H.I.V./AIDS. One of the biggest controversies he has bumped into is the whole thing about routine testing. From Tom’s point of view and his public health background, he certainly has the support of the medical community that there shouldn’t be barriers to routine H.I.V. testing. We’re talking about the difference between written, informed consent and a routine blood test. In all but 11 states, H.I.V. testing is routine, throughout most of the country. It remains a special case here in New York State. Tom took this on from a public health point of view, and said we should make testing easier.

Dr. Gulick, who is prominent in the field of clinical research in H.I.V. and has worked on the issue since the 1980s, said he understood advocates’ concern about stigma but said that the benefits of widespread, readily available H.I.V. testing outweighed such concerns. “There are great studies that show if people are H.I.V.-infected, they don’t pass the virus on to other people,” he said. “Despite this huge controversy, I think time will tell that H.I.V. testing will be routine and that this will become another example in how New York City is a leader.”",28/01/2009

The New York Times,A Wrenching AIDS Tale Spanning Two Continents,"Photo

There’s a simple moment in the Off Broadway hit “In the Continuum” that speaks far more eloquently than any government statistics could about the AIDS crisis in Africa. Abigail Murambe, an announcer on Zimbabwe’s state-run television channel, is trying to flag down a jitney after learning that she is HIV-positive. Shooing away the street urchins pestering her for money, she says: “Go away, you kids! Where are your parents?”

The words are no sooner out of her mouth than her expression changes. In a flash, a look of horror crumples the features of Danai Gurira, who plays Abigail, a character she invented while studying acting at New York University. As Abigail realizes that the begging children are among Zimbabwe’s more than one million AIDS orphans, she also registers the awareness that her own young son and the baby she is carrying could someday be on the street too — like so many other African women, Abigail has been infected by her husband.

“In the Continuum,” which plays through Feb. 10 at the Yale Repertory Theater, cleverly mirrors Abigail’s story with that of Nia, a troubled teenager from South Central Los Angeles who finds herself in a similar predicament: pregnant and HIV-positive, but also jobless, husband-less and pretty much homeless. Nia, the creation of another former N.Y.U. acting student, Nikkole Salter, is, in Ms. Salter’s winning performance, a headstrong mix of innocence and guile. She feels alternately thrilled and angry with the high school basketball star responsible for both her pregnancy and her infection, and she does not know if she is better off with his love or his money.

When, in 2003, Ms. Gurira and Ms. Salter combined their separate monologues at the suggestion of an N.Y.U. professor, the whole clearly added up to more than the sum of its parts. The show opened commercially at Primary Stages in 2005 and then moved to the Perry Street Theater. The stop at the Yale Rep is part of a larger tour that has taken Ms. Gurira and Ms. Salter across the country and around the world, and on a nearly bare set designed by Peter R. Feuchtwanger, with minimal costuming by Sarah Hilliard and a handful of props by Jay Duckworth, they demonstrate why “In the Continuum” has been so successful.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Under the direction of Robert O’Hara, Ms. Gurira and Ms. Salter people the stage with more than a dozen vivid characters — men, women and children — from different but intersecting worlds. A pair of glasses and a scarf turn Ms. Salter into Nia’s well-meaning but clueless social worker; the scarf becomes a crying baby when Nia visits her preoccupied mother. Ms. Gurira puts on a posh accent to become one of Abigail’s expatriate high school friends; a feather headdress and a fly whisk transform her into a witch doctor. Nia tosses aside a tissue in Los Angeles; Abigail retrieves it in Harare.

As the two women search for help, the play lays out — with compassion and humor and sometimes more detail than is strictly necessary — exactly how unsatisfactory their options are. The problem is the same for both the girl in the ’hood and the married woman in Africa: if either tries to prevent her man from infecting others by revealing his HIV status, she risks destroying his willingness and his ability to see her through the illness.",21/01/2007
The New York Times,Memory Books,"Books filled with photos and details of a family’s history.

In an extraordinary photo essay for the BBC, Kate Holt of HelpAge International illustrated how an N.G.O. in Uganda is helping people ensure that their family history is not lost to Aids or old age:

Parents in Africa often do not leave behind photo albums or diaries when they die, due to the continent’s strong oral traditions, as well as poverty. But for children orphaned very young, this makes it difficult to find out their family history.

More than a million children in Uganda have been orphaned by Aids. Many of them now live with their grandparents.

The elderly grandparents and HIV-positive parents are being taught how to write a “memory book” so they can pass on their family history and traditions to the children, before they become too ill and die.

According to Holt, the memory book scheme is also teaching people how to write wills, so that their children and grandchildren can defend their property rights.",27/08/2009
The New York Times,The Question of Circumcision and H.I.V.,"The New York City health commissioner’s decision to encourage men at high risk of contracting HIV to get circumcised has drawn an array of reactions today, including a note of caution from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

On March 28, the World Health Organization recommended that countries include circumcision as part of their AIDS prevention efforts, citing studies in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa that showed that circumcision could lower a man’s risk of contracting HIV from heterosexual sex. Today, Donald G. McNeil Jr., a science writer for The Times, reported that the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has asked the city’s public hospitals system to perform the procedure at no charge for uninsured men.



But from the sound of things, the mayor may not have been fully briefed.

“I have not had a chance to talk to Tom Frieden and Alan Aviles about this,” Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Queens, referring to Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the health commissioner, and Alan D. Aviles, chairman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.

According to Diane Cardwell, The Times’s City Hall bureau chief, Mr. Bloomberg added that although education levels in New York City are “far and away greater than a lot of the third world countries,” residents are still contracting HIV “that turns into AIDS and dying. Shame on us. We have to do something about it and we should be looking at everything — and when reputable health organizations talk about ways to do it you certainly are going to give it some serious consideration.”

He added, “Whether it’s something that the government should be involved in, or just giving advice and making sure that people get educated, education in the end is the real tool to stop the spread of AIDS in our society. That may or may not be true elsewheres.”

The W.H.O. has cautioned that circumcision does not provide complete protection from HIV infection, and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS has noted that little is known about the effectiveness of circumcision in preventing infection among men who engage in anal sex.

Several health experts said today they were uncertain what effect the W.H.O. recommendation and the awareness campaign proposed by Dr. Frieden will have.

Dr. Bruce R. Schackman, associate professor of public health at the Weill Cornell Medical College, said, “It was a tremendous finding and very responsible of the W.H.O. to move pretty quickly in terms of this recommendation.” He added that in certain parts of Africa, men have followed the recommendation at fairly high levels.

Adult circumcision is typically an outpatient procedure performed by a urologist, with the patient under local anesthesia or mild sedation, according to Dr. Michael D. Stifelman, the director of minimally invasive urology at N.Y.U. Medical Center.

Typically, he said, the procedure results in 24 hours of mild discomfort requiring pain medication, but the patient is usually back to work within 48 hours and back to all normal activity within 2 or 3 weeks.

Dr. Stifelman said the most common reasons for getting circumcised among American men are phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin does not retract naturally over the glans of the penis, causing discomfort, difficulty in urination or buildup of debris; infections of the foreskin; and lesions or abnormal growths on the foreskin. Adult circumcisions for social or religious reasons — including among converts to Judaism — are fairly rare.

Dr. Stifelman said he believed that most uncircumcised men prefer to stay that way and added, “I’m not sure this W.H.O. recommendation will be powerful enough to change their cultural beliefs.”

Update, 10:52 p.m.: The city issued a statement saying it had not developed a campaign to promote circumcision, but had begun a discussion on the possible benefits of the procedure. See here for more details.",05/04/2007
The New York Times,"Livestock Antibiotics, Alzheimer's Care and Detox Diets","HIV and Tuberculosis Infections Worse than Estimated, Report Says

The number of people around the world who are infected with both HIV and tuberculosis is double previous estimates, a World Health Organization report says, and efforts to slow the spread of TB have been inadequate. The report said there were some 9.2 million new cases of TB in 2007, most of them concentrated in India, China, Indonesia, Nigeria and South Africa, The Washington Post reports.

Opposition to Ban on Antibiotic Use in Livestock

A proposal to restrict the routine use of antibiotics in livestock is already facing fierce industry opposition, Reuters reports, with officials from the American Farm Bureau Federation saying a ban on nontherapeutic use would compromise food safety and increase costs. Some 70 percent of all antibiotics sold in the United States are used in healthy livestock, and there is a concern the widespread use could lead to new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The High Cost of Caring for the Elderly with Alzheimer's

The health care costs of Alzheimer's disease patients are more than triple those of other elderly people, even without counting the uncompensated care typically provided by family members, a new report says. The Alzheimer's Association report estimated annual costs per patient are at least $33,007, compared with $10,603 for other elderly patients.

Grant Money Available for Autism Research

Some $60 million in grants for research into autism is up for grabs, but the money has to be allocated by the fall of 2010, The Wall Street Journal health blog reports. The money, which comes from the stimulus bill, is the largest funding opportunity ever for research into the developmental disorder, according to the National Institutes of Mental Health.

Evaluating Detox Diets

Gwyneth Paltrow, Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce Knowles have touted the benefits of so-called detox or cleansing diets, USA Today reports, but health experts are skeptical about whether the diets are good for health, saying they may even be harmful. Obesity experts say the diets don't lead to long-term weight loss and may exacerbate other medical problems; The diets, many of which are liquid diets, often do not include enough protein, so they can lead to loss of muscle mass, experts say.

The New York Times,Is Congress Partly to Blame for D.C.’s AIDS Crisis?,"AIDS cases are increasing in the nation’s capital and Congress may be partly to blame.

Congress fanned the flames of a public health disaster when it used its powers over the District of Columbia’s budget to bar the city from spending even locally raised tax dollars on clean needle programs.

These programs have been shown across the United States and abroad to slow the spread of AIDS by giving drug addicts access to clean needles.

D.C. has struggled to put in place a program, relying on meager private funding, but it has not been able to keep up with the need.

The harm wrought by Congress’s senseless ban is underscored in a hair-raising report just out from the District’s health department.

The city’s first AIDS update since 2000 found that Washington has the highest AIDS case rate in the nation, with 128.4 cases per 100,000 population in the District. That’s compared to just 14.0 cases per 100,000 population in the United States as a whole.

Cases appear to be increasing more rapidly in D.C. than in comparable cities with well-established needle exchange programs.

The AIDS epidemic is partly driven by intravenous drug users, who often contract the disease by sharing dirty needles, then transmit the virus to sexual partners and unborn children. The D.C. study found that more than 20 percent of the city’s cases could be traced back to intravenous drug use.

The impact on women — especially black women — has been catastrophic. The number of women with AIDS in the District has jumped by more than 76% over the past six years, according to the report. Black women account for only 58% of the District’s female population, but they account for 90% of all new female HIV cases — and 93% of all women living with AIDS.

Children appear to suffer more from AIDS in the Washington, D.C. than anywhere else in the country. Between 2001 and 2006 in the District, 56 children ages 13 or younger were diagnosed with either HIV or AIDS. During that same period, many states reported no new childhood infections.

Critics argue that handing out needles encourages drug use — despite studies here and abroad showing that the programs cut infections without increasing addiction. By barring the District from using even local tax dollars for needle programs, the federal government has hurt women and children and driven up the city’s AIDS rate. Congress, which is on the verge of overturning the ban, needs to act right away.",27/11/2007

The New York Times,The Pope’s Words on Condoms,"Excerpted from “Light of the World: The Pope, The Church and The Signs Of The Times,” an interview with Pope Benedict XVI and Peter Seewald. All rights St. Ignatius Press (2010).

On the occasion of your trip to Africa in March 2009, the Vatican’s policy on Aids once again became the target of media criticism. Twenty-five percent of all Aids victims around the world today are treated in Catholic facilities. In some countries, such as Lesotho, for example, the statistic is 40 percent. In Africa you stated that the Church’s traditional teaching has proven to be the only sure way to stop the spread of HIV. Critics, including critics from the Church’s own ranks, object that it is madness to forbid a high-risk population to use condoms.

The media coverage completely ignored the rest of the trip to Africa on account of a single statement. Someone had asked me why the Catholic Church adopts an unrealistic and ineffective position on Aids. At that point, I really felt that I was being provoked, because the Church does more than anyone else. And I stand by that claim. Because she is the only institution that assists people up close and concretely, with prevention, education, help, counsel, and accompaniment. And because she is second to none in treating so many Aids victims, especially children with Aids.

I had the chance to visit one of these wards and to speak with the patients. That was the real answer: The Church does more than anyone else, because she does not speak from the tribunal of the newspapers, but helps her brothers and sisters where they are actually suffering. In my remarks I was not making a general statement about the condom issue, but merely said, and this is what caused such great offense, that we cannot solve the problem by distributing condoms. Much more needs to be done. We must stand close to the people, we must guide and help them; and we must do this both before and after they contract the disease.

As a matter of fact, you know, people can get condoms when they want them anyway. But this just goes to show that condoms alone do not resolve the question itself. More needs to happen. Meanwhile, the secular realm itself has developed the so-called ABC Theory: Abstinence-Be Faithful-Condom, where the condom is understood only as a last resort, when the other two points fail to work. This means that the sheer fixation on the condom implies a banalization of sexuality, which, after all, is precisely the dangerous source of the attitude of no longer seeing sexuality as the expression of love, but only a sort of drug that people administer to themselves. This is why the fight against the banalization of sexuality is also a part of the struggle to ensure that sexuality is treated as a positive value and to enable it to have a positive effect on the whole of man’s being.

There may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility, on the way toward recovering an awareness that not everything is allowed and that one cannot do whatever one wants. But it is not really the way to deal with the evil of HIV infection. That can really lie only in a humanization of sexuality.

Are you saying, then, that the Catholic Church is actually not opposed in principle to the use of condoms?",23/11/2010
The New York Times,Ukraine Will Not Allow Adoption Proposed by Elton John,"The government of Ukraine said Monday that Elton John cannot adopt a child from that country because he is too old and is not married, The Associated Press reported.

But Yuriy Pavlenko, who is Ukraine’s minister for family, youth and sports, said that the adoption could not be permitted.

The New York Times,Jim Parsons and Lee Pace Join Cast of ‘Normal Heart’ on Broadway,"Getty Images

Proving that it is possible for the star of a CBS comedy to take a break from his series without mortifying the network or his co-stars or burning all of his bridges in the entertainment industry, Jim Parsons, the “Big Bang Theory” star, will join the cast of the coming Broadway production of “The Normal Heart,” the play’s press representatives said Monday. Mr. Parsons, who in recent months has won an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of the physicist Sheldon Cooper, will make his Broadway debut in “The Normal Heart,” playing Tommy Boatwright, a Southerner in a nascent group of HIV/AIDS activists in the early 1980s. Also joining the cast is Lee Pace, a star of the late, lamented ABC series “Pushing Daisies,” who will be making his Broadway debut in the role of Bruce Niles, a closeted fellow activist.

The New York Times,AIDS Drug Provokes Legal Fight in India,"""The quality matches that of U.S.- manufactured drugs, but the prices are affordable,"" she added. ""These drugs are very important, which is why we are opposing this patent application.""

The immediate challenge came when the Delhi Network of Positive People and the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS registered a formal opposition to a patent application for the drug tenofovir made by Gilead Sciences, based in the United States.

The groups' lawyers make the case Tuesday on a scientific technicality, arguing that tenofovir is not a new drug, but a modified version of an earlier drug, and therefore not eligible for a new patent under India's act. The successful challenge to a patent for the cancer drug, Gleevac, was also made on this basis — that the application claims ""a new form of a known substance.""

Those backing the challenge are hoping to gain a legal precedent for use in other patent applications. They say the recent rejection of a patent application by Novartis for a cancer drug, on the grounds of similar legal arguments, gave some cause for optimism.

The World Health Organization recently recommended tenofovir for patients who are just starting treatment for AIDS, as well as for those who have been receiving antiretroviral treatment therapy for some time but have become resistant to those treatments. The drug has relatively few known side effects.

Eric Goermaere, of Médecins Sans Frontières in South Africa, said in a statement: ""If Gilead is granted the patent, our patients will face a potentially deadly delay.""

In developed countries, Gilead's tenofovir costs $5,718 per patient per year. Cipla, one of the largest generics companies in India, is marketing a generic version, called Tenvir, at a cost of $700 per person per year in India. The chairman of Cipla, Yusuf Hamied, said that the drug would, in time, be made available in Africa for about half the price in India.

But Tenvir would have to be withdrawn if Gilead was given a patent, lasting 12 years.

About 150 protesters, many of them HIV-positive, demonstrated outside the Indian Parliamenttoday in support of the legal action, carrying banners declaring ""Patients before patents"" and ""Lives before profit.""

Among the protesters was Loon Gangte, president of the Delhi Network of Positive People, who — like more than five million people in India — is HIV-positive. ""If this patent is granted, it will chop off a lifeline for me,"" he said.

The New York Times,Awards Night | Not Afraid of Color,"This week, the paint company Benjamin Moore will present its Hue Awards for the best use of color in architecture and interiors, and the lifetime achievement award will go to the New York design team of William Diamond and Anthony Baratta, whose sophisticated, bold, and vividly-colored interiors have been featured in The New York Times Magazine. Although the choice of Diamond Baratta would seem a no-brainer, this is the first time that the award has gone to interior designers; past winners were the architects Steven Holl, Ettore Sottsass, and Ricardo Legorreta. Diamond Baratta is known for custom-designing everything from fabrics to braided rugs, and paint colors are no exception. But in an odd coincidence, the designers have always used Benjamin Moore paint bases. And when they told told the company that they were donating their $5000 prize money to the Center for Special Studies at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, which provides specialized care to people with HIV and AIDS, Benjamin Moore matched Diamond Baratta’s donation. Baratta credits Diamond with being the firm’s color maven. “Bill is really the maestro of color selection,” he said. “It’s like music–you have to have perfect pitch.” Above, a few of the firm’s colorful interiors.",03/05/2010
The New York Times,Travel Booking for a Good Cause,"Book a flight, save a life. That’s the goal of MASSIVEGOOD, a new fund-raising initiative that allows travelers to make “micro-contributions” to global health causes when booking a plane, hotel or car.

For example, a traveler booking a flight on Travelocity can click the rainbow-colored MASSIVEGOOD logo and donate $2 to treat two children for malaria.

MASSIVEGOOD is scheduled to go live this Thursday, when former President Bill Clinton makes the first “click” at an inaugural event at the United Nations in New York. The event will also feature a short film by Spike Lee and an original song by Will.i.am, both created for the campaign.

Proceeds go to UNITAID, a Geneva-based organization that raises money to treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in low-income countries. Supporting organizations include Travelocity, Accor, the American Society of Travel Agents, American Express Business Travel and Carlson Wagonlit Travel.

“There are over two billion air passengers alone each year,” said Dr. Bernard Salomé, managing director of the Millennium Foundation for Innovative Finance for Health, a nonprofit organization in Geneva that created the campaign, in a press statement. “Imagine if even a quarter of the people making those reservations decided to add just $2 to the price of their ticket.”",01/03/2010
The New York Times,Behind the Scenes: Altered Visions,"Kurt Weston, 51, was once part of what he calls “the illusion machine.” As a glamour photographer, he would jet to Europe with hair stylists and makeup artists to transform models and create the appearance of beauty.

Now he says he is interested only in authenticity. Mr. Weston’s subjects are the elderly and the frail, with special attention to issues surrounding blindness. Surface appearances do not interest him so much.

What changed his work was an HIV/AIDS-related condition — cytomegalovirus retinitis — that destroyed his sight in one eye and left the other with minimal peripheral vision. In 1995, Mr. Weston was close to death, but new antiviral drugs saved his life.

Today, he is a legally blind photographer.

“I was grateful to be alive, but I assumed I couldn’t do photography,” he recalled in a recent telephone interview from Huntington Beach, Calif., where he lives. “But I learned mobility skills, adaptive computer skills and how to use low-vision devices like monoculars, video magnifiers and thick clear-view glasses to help me see.”

Mr. Weston was shocked when he realized he could photograph again. “I still don’t see very much of anything,” he said, “but I see enough to get by.”

His first major projects were about his own blindness. He started with self-portraits that illustrated the psychological, emotional and physical weight of vision loss. There is nothing glamorous about these images. He lay atop a scanner and dripped foaming glass cleaner onto the surface to create visual disturbance. Some images include the vision assistance devices on which he relies.

“I try to replicate my vision,” Mr. Weston said. “When i move my eye, I see spiderlike tendrils. There’s nothing in focus or sharp.”

In his next series, Silent Age, he photographed elderly people, using a medium format camera. With a scanner, he combined these images with photographs he took of peeling paint on the walls of Chicago subway stations. Together, they suggest the deterioration that often comes with advanced age. Other images involved subjects, often in their 80s and 90s, laying on the scanner.

Mr. Weston feels he is unlikely to reach a great age himself because of HIV and the drugs he takes. “The body is like a machine that breaks down,” he said. “It deteriorates over time.”

While the concept of a blind photographer may seem counterintuitive, Mr. Weston is not alone. Many legally blind people photograph and exhibit their work, as Time noted in “The Art and Heart of Blind Photographers.” There are over 150 members of a group started by Tim O’Brien. The Web site Blind Photographers developed out of the Flickr community.

When Mr. Weston teaches photography at the Huntington Beach Art Center, he doesn’t tell his students that he is legally blind. He waits until they figure it out. He says that after their original shock, the students realize he has much to teach them.

He helps them develop their vision, just as he has expanded his own.

“I was part of the illusion machine, but now I’m dealing with mortality and the reality of being human,” Mr. Weston said. “I just want it to be intensely real.”",29/06/2009

The New York Times,Stadium Activism,"Incorporating activism into a rock concert, as exemplified by U2.

Reporting from Amsterdam, The Guardian’s Dorian Lynskey wrote:

Inside the city’s ArenA, the color green floods a giant mosaic of video screens, below which stand the four members of U2, three weeks into their 360 tour. As the band strike up Sunday Bloody Sunday, the screens flash images of protesters on the streets of Tehran alongside lines in Farsi by the Persian poet Rumi. Thus, a song written 26 years ago about political violence in Northern Ireland finds a new and pressing context.

The sequence vividly illustrates U2’s unique brand of stadium activism. There’s also a tribute to the incarcerated Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi during Walk On, and a recorded message from Desmond Tutu for the One campaign, co-founded by Bono to mobilize support for developing country debt relief and HIV/Aids treatment, among other issues.

According to Lynskey, U2 “have always worked on the principle that in the awareness-raising business something, however imperfect, is better than nothing.” But, he said: “Iran-watchers might justifiably argue that an emotive one-minute montage simplifies, even trivialises, a complicated situation.”",06/08/2009

At the time of his death, Mr. Friedman was the artistic director of City Center’s Off-Center series, which produces revivals of pathbreaking Off Broadway musicals and will stage “Gone Missing” on July 11 and 12, the theater announced on Friday.

(Read more about what Mr. Friedman’s death meant for the theater community.)

The New York Times,Free Agency Ushers in End of Tampering Season,"After meeting LeBron James on Thursday, Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni expressed confidence that his team had made a good pitch to the star free agent.

The coach also said jokingly that he was relieved that he could finally utter James’s name and meet him in person without fear of getting fined by the N.B.A.

“You know what was good? LeBron James being there,” D’Antoni said. “No one can call me for tampering. It’s liberating, really.”

D’Antoni was referring to the heavy fines against Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Steve Kerr, the former general manager of the Phoenix Suns, and others. Cuban was fined $100,000 for merely saying that any team would benefit having James on it squad.



Now that the veil on speaking about and to James (and Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Amar’e Stoudemire, etc.) has been lifted, it’s worth asking where all the fines went. It turns out that the N.B.A. gives the money to various charities. One is N.B.A. Cares, which supports campaigns that address social issues like literacy and HIV/AIDS education.

Coaches and front office executives have to pay the fines out of their own pockets and are not allowed to appeal their penalties. A league spokesman declined to say how much in fines the league collected this year, and said there is no lay-away plan for those who are penalized.",02/07/2010
The New York Times,2 Flights Carried Man With Deadly TB,"But those and other so-called first-line drugs do little against a type of tuberculosis known as multidrug-resistant TB, or MDR TB. More worryingly, the type of tuberculosis found in the infected American — known as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR TB — resists treatment even by three of the six second-line drugs used when first-line drugs fail. Only two cases of the strain were found last year in the United States.

Tuberculosis is typically spread by sneezing or coughing, and the C.D.C. said the man potentially was infectious during the two flights.

Health officials recommended medical exams for cabin crew members on the flights, as well as passengers sitting within a few rows of the man. Dr. Gerberding would not say the row in which he sat, but the doctor said the nearby passengers would be contacted. More information can be obtained at the Web site of the Centers for Disease Control, www.cdc.gov.

Antibiotics have helped lower tuberculosis rates for years, also though the CDC found some resurgence starting in 1985, particularly among recent immigrants and people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Still, TB cases hit an all-time low last year in the United States of 13,767, according to The Associated Press.

But tuberculosis is still deadly, particularly in countries where medical care is lacking, killing about 1.6 million people each year worldwide. It is particularly deadly among those infected with HIV.

At any given time, one person in three worldwide is infected with dormant tuberculosis germs, according to the World Health Organization. People become ill when the bacteria become active, usually when a person’s immunity declines, whether because of advancing age, HIV infection or some other medical problem.

While first-line drugs usually are effective, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis can develop if those medications are misused or improperly administered. That requires treatment with more expensive — and less well-tolerated — second-line drugs, which require treatment courses of 18 to 24 months, compared with six to nine months for first-line drugs.

Misuse or mismanagement of those drugs, in turn, can render them ineffective, leading to the extensively drug resistant TB, or XDR TB. Options for treating it are extremely limited, according to the W.H.O. Only about 30 percent of patients can be cured.

A 2005 survey by the C.D.C. and the W.H.O. found that 10 percent of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strains met the definition for XDR TB, Dr. Gerberding testified before Congress in March. Cases of the latter were found in 17 countries, most often in the former Soviet Union and Asia. While in the United States just 2 percent of multidrug-resistant TB cases were XDR TB, the figure was 15 percent in South Korea and 19 percent in Latvia.

In one outbreak in South Africa, Dr. Gerberding testified, 41 percent of the 544 patients infected with tuberculosis were found to have multidrug-resistant strains; of those, 53 met the definition of XDR TB.

Of the latter group, all but one person died, on average just 16 days after health workers had tested them.",29/05/2007
The New York Times,"In a First, Gene Therapy Halts a Fatal Brain Disease","The study opens new avenues for using gene therapy to treat brain diseases, said Dr. Theodore Friedmann, a gene therapy pioneer at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine.

“Many think the central nervous system is intractable and unapproachable,” he said. This study proves them wrong.

The research began with a determined mother, Amber Salzman, who was an executive with a Ph.D. in mathematics at GlaxoSmithKline. In 2000, her nephew was diagnosed with ALD, a disease she had heard of only in the movie, “Lorenzo’s Oil.”

He was “this wonderful sweet brilliant kid,” Dr. Salzman said. “All of a sudden he loses his abilities. He crumbles in front of your eyes.”

She had her one-year-old son tested and found that he had the mutated gene, as did another nephew. She looked into Lorenzo’s oil, a difficult dietary regimen featuring a specially designed oil.

Statisticians at her company told her studies of it did not show any effect.

Dr. Salzman met with Dr. Tachi Yamada, who was head of research and development at Glaxo. “I said, ‘It will be a few years before the bomb goes off in my son and other nephew. What do we do?’”

Dr. Yamada told her that her best bet was gene therapy, but it had never been tried against a disease like ALD.",05/10/2017
The New York Times,Hillary Clinton Aides Issue Talking Points on Rebutting Attacks,"Photo

Aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton circulated a series of talking points to allies on Monday to help them respond to a spate of negative news accounts in recent weeks about the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

An email from Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman, Nick Merrill, which was obtained by The New York Times, instructed those receiving it to focus on the work of the foundation and stress that it “is a philanthropy, period.” The email also emphasizes that the contributions the foundation receives from foreign governments, for which it has been criticized, are driven by its “groundbreaking, life-changing work around the globe.”

The talking points were sent to a broad list of surrogates and allies after a string of critical news articles about foreign donations to the foundation and reports of internal conflict at the organization that led to the departure of its chief executive, Eric Braverman.

In addition to highlighting the foundation’s work on HIV/AIDS treatment and reducing greenhouse gases, Mr. Merrill also stressed its transparency and noted that it was the disclosure of its donors that allowed for the critical coverage.

“Let’s remember why journalists are able to dig through all these records,” Mr. Merrill wrote. “Because unlike many other similar charities, the foundation voluntarily discloses all of its contributors’ names, right on the Clinton Foundation website. And it refuses to take anonymous contributions. No charity is required to do these, but the Clinton Foundation does it, on its own accord.”

The foundation’s staff has made similar points to a number of news outlets in recent months, but the latest effort seems to reflect a growing sense of urgency among Mrs. Clinton’s advisers to push back against these articles. Since Mrs. Clinton lacks a full-scale political operation to respond to critical coverage, the effort has largely fallen to the foundation’s staff, which may not be able to answer charges as aggressively as a campaign would. The comments — and the strong focus on the foundation’s good works — also provide a hint of how the Clintons plan to respond to attacks if, as is expected, Mrs. Clinton runs for president.",02/03/2015
The New York Times,Clinton Signs AIDS Financing Pledge,"Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton just signed a pledge that commits the next president to investing $50 billion by 2013 to combat AIDS around the world. She is also planning to deliver a formal policy on AIDS.

Gay and lesbian activists have been asking the presidential candidates to sign the pledge, which is being circulated by a global AIDS alliance.

Among the Democratic candidates, only Bill Richardson had signed the pledge. John Edwards and Barack Obama have issued AIDS plans and have agreed to many of the pledge’s goals but have not signed it.

ACT UP, a coalition of gay and lesbian activists, had been planning a demonstration against Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday in Philadelphia, where the Democratic presidential candidates are meeting for a debate. Some activists had been complaining that she had not signed the pledge.

But when The Caucus contacted the Clinton campaign, a spokesman said that Mrs. Clinton would sign the pledge shortly; moments later she did.

“Senator Clinton has been working on a formal AIDS policy that she will be unveiling in the near future,” a statement from the campaign said. “She already supports investing $50 billion over the next five years to fight global AIDS and advocates a comprehensive approach to fighting AIDS both here and abroad.”

Initially, ACT UP, which has been demonstrating on behalf of people with AIDS for nearly 20 years, announced that it would march against Mrs. Clinton at the debate Tuesday. Kaytee Riek, a member of ACT UP and a member of Health GAP, an organization that is also sponsoring the demonstration, said that the protest was aimed at Mrs. Clinton because “she’s the front-runner,” even though she has a “spectacular” record on AIDS. She also said that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obama had already put out plans that would achieve many of the goals stated in the pledge.

But informed subsequently that Mrs. Clinton had signed the pledge, Ms. Riek said, “That’s excellent!” She also said that this would probably change the focus of the demonstration on Tuesday to urge all candidates to make discussion of AIDS a campaign priority.

Mr. Edwards was the first to issue a comprehensive AIDS plan that includes $50 billion, which Ms. Riek said was “excellent.”

Senator Obama has said that as president, he would double foreign assistance from $25 billion per year to $50 billion per year for numerous projects, including the treatment of AIDS and other diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. In outlining his “millennium development goals,” Mr. Obama’s campaign said he would “dedicate as much funding to HIV/AIDS as possible — without cutting into other critical foreign assistance programs — to ensure a comprehensive fight against this global pandemic.”

Mrs. Clinton has addressed numerous aspects of the AIDS issue, including the racial disparities that ACT UP has said is one of its chief concerns.

“If HIV-AIDS were the leading cause of death of white women between the ages of 25 and 34, there would be an outraged outcry in this country,” Mrs. Clinton said at a forum in June at Howard University. She also said she was committed to getting Medicaid to cover AIDS treatment.",26/10/2007
The New York Times,Running for a Cause: Commitment Challenge,"Jessica Dolan/U.S. Fund for UNICEF

For four years, I talked about running the New York City Marathon. But each year I ended up curbside, coffee cup in hand, watching waves of people push themselves to the finish. I would leave the race and say to friends, “I’d really like to run the marathon while I live in New York.”

Some obstacle — work, travel, graduate school, the heat, a nagging soccer injury — would provide me with a convenient excuse. In 2008, I entered the marathon lottery, but was — to my relief — denied a spot.

This reluctance to commit did not carry over into other areas of my life, and certainly not my professional life. I work for the U.S. Fund for Unicef, the United Nations Children’s Fund. In over 150 countries, Unicef provides children with health care, clean water, nutrition, education, protection, emergency relief, and more. The U.S. Fund supports Unicef’s work through fund raising, advocacy, and education in the United States. There’s no place for dilettantes here.

I’ve traveled all over the world and met amazing children, like J.R., an HIV-positive teenager in Brazil who spends three hours getting to the Unicef office to organize online support groups twice a week that help others living with HIV. I’ve met children in the Amazon who travel six hours by boat to go to school.

Why couldn’t I muster the courage to tackle 26.2 miles of New York City roadway?

My work with Unicef provided the motivation and the opportunity. Last year, the U.S. Fund formed Team Unicef, which raised over $150,000 running in the 2009 New York City Marathon. The 2010 Team Unicef has 60 runners and a goal to raise $225,000 for Unicef’s lifesaving programs. We’ve already raised over $133,000. I signed up, with a personal fund raising goal of $3,500.

None of the sports I participated in during high school and college prepared me for the mental and physical challenges of marathon training. The longest I had run before this year was six miles. Now, since June, I’ve run almost 300 miles, including the Queens Half Marathon (in 90-degree heat) and the ING NYC 18M Tune-up.

I bought a sensor for my running shoes that allows me to track my progress online and virtually race against a friend who lives in Hong Kong. My runs are posted on my Facebook page and I’ve received encouragement from family, friends, and Unicef colleagues and supporters in Europe, Brazil, Kenya, Cambodia, and all over the United States.

Dolores Gahan/U.S. Fund for Unicef

It’s not always easy, but I’m committed. During a visit to Peru this summer, I planned to train at altitude, but a five-minute soccer game 12,000 feet above sea level with some young Peruvian kids was too much. I believe the medical term is “bonked.”

After playing catch-up when I returned to New York, I finished a 20-mile training run last week, and I physically and mentally feel much better.

I don’t know if I would go through rigors of marathon training without the inspiration of children around the world who go through so much more. It’s important for me to honor them, and Unicef’s work.

A few weeks ago, Unicef announced that the number of children who die every day from preventable causes has dropped this year from 24,000 to 22,000. In 1990, just 20 years ago, 34,000 children died every day from preventable causes. Each day I train for the marathon, 12,000 more children are waking up and starting their long journey to school. That’s something I can be proud of no matter my finishing time.

Brian Meyers is the Director of Board Relations and Leadership Development at the U.S. Fund for Unicef. He lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and hopes to finish the marathon under four hours.",14/10/2010
The New York Times,"What ‘Angels in America’ Meant to Them, and to You","Joan Marcus

For the film and theater director Mike Nichols the play changed how he thought about characters. For the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Doug Wright (“I Am My Own Wife”) it established a dividing line for gay-themed theater. For other dramatists like Lisa Kron (“Well”), Tarell Alvin McCraney (“The Brother/Sister Plays”) and Sarah Ruhl (“In the Next Room, or the vibrator play”) it was inspiration. And for academics and artistic directors, it became the last major stage work of the 20th century to wrestle with.

Tony Kushner’s play “Angels in America” opens Thursday at Off Broadway’s Signature Theater Company, the first revival in New York since the original, acclaimed Broadway run in 1993-94, and it seems like a ripe moment to ask ArtsBeat readers: What’s your sharpest memory from seeing or reading “Angels”? And two decades on, how do the themes or politics of “Angels” resonate today?

As for the examples above, here are some excerpts from interviews last week.

Mr. Nichols: “It replaced drama’s traditional family – unhappy parents, unhappy teens – with a group of friends bound by love and illness, who became their own family. It changed the way I saw characters. We saw kindness on stage for once. We were reminded that love means wanting a person to be his or her best self.”

Mr. Wright, on plays about gay life and characters pre- and post-“Angels”: “The plays before generally declared, to varying degrees of urgency, ‘this is who we are and pay attention to us.’ What Tony did was write a play where being gay was a metaphor for the whole human experience. He conveyed that we all experience injustice and persecution, and the characters in ‘Angels’ just happened to experience these things because they were gay.”

Ms. Kron: ‘Angels’ put us at the center of the intellectual universe as gay people, and showed that gay people can be the metaphorical stand-ins for all people. ‘Angels’ marked the complete obliteration of any kind of ghettoization of gay people in American culture.”

Mr. McCraney: “I read the play as a young gay man in American whose mother was HIV-positive, and in a way the play is like a time capsule of not only a particular era but also all of the lost men of color who were HIV-positive whose lives were decimated, men who I never knew but inspired me, like Alvin Ailey and Joseph Beam.”

Ms. Ruhl: “I think because we’re a young country our drama has less of that sense of exploding history than other countries. I think Tony Kushner made people feel that going to the theater was a way of engaging in this incredible aesthetic, political, civic, historical event, and a historical event that was also highly of the moment. I think he influenced younger playwrights a great deal and taught us not to be afraid of epic or of language. Certainly I took courage from him when I decided to write a play – ‘Passion Play’ – in three acts and three historical epochs.”

Jean Howard, chairwoman of the English and Comparative Literature department at Columbia University, who will teach a course in the spring on Mr. Kushner’s work: “I’m not sure I would have taught a course just on Tony 15 years ago. But the key thing is that he’s kept producing work – he didn’t have just one hit, but since then he is extending and deepening, like ‘Homebody/Kabul’ and ‘Caroline, or Change.’ ”

Kay Thigpen, managing director of Trustus Theater in Columbia, S.C.: “It’s the only show that we’ve ever done that sold out completely before we even started performances, in 1996. And unlike some of our other shows, it didn’t inspire protests. I think a lot of people in Columbia understood that this play was something special, that it had a point of view about the 1980s and AIDS that was worth considering. Not everyone agreed with that point of view, of course, but I think American theater was lucky to have a play that tried to capture a time in our history so ambitiously.”

The New York Times,"Sex Education for Teenagers, Online and in Texts","In Chicago, teenagers can subscribe to Sex-Ed Loop, a program endorsed by the district that includes weekly automated texts about contraception, relationships and disease prevention. Through Hookup, California teenagers can text their ZIP codes to a number and receive locations for health clinics.

Many services, like Sexetc.org, a national site run by and for teenagers, offer both privacy and communities where adolescents can learn about sexuality and relationships, particularly on mobile devices, eluding parental scrutiny. Services offer links to blogs, interactive games, moderated forums, and Facebook and Twitter pages.

The messages, rendered in teenspeak, can be funny and blunt: for Real Talk, a technology-driven H.I.V. prevention program run by the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York, teenagers made a YouTube video, shouting a refrain from a rap song, “Sport Dat Raincoat,” during which a girl carrying an umbrella is pelted with condoms.

“When we ask young people what is the No. 1 way they learn about sex, they say, ‘We Google it,’ ” said Deb Levine, executive director of ISIS Inc., an Oakland, Calif.,-based nonprofit organization that administers texting services and checks content for medical accuracy. “But most of the time, the best information is not coming up in those searches.”

Quantifying services is difficult. But Ms. Levine, who hosts Sex::Tech, a conference about sexual health programs for youth, said that requests to make presentations about online or mobile services had soared. Typically, she receives between 40 and 50 applications. This year, she received about 120.

Unlike classroom lessons, which are supposed to follow local, state or federal guidelines, Internet programs have no independent standards. And proponents of abstinence-based sexual education argue that these digital services presume that sexual activity among teenagers is the norm, and do not spend enough time on alternatives.

“They are only focusing on the risk-reduction model,” said Valerie Huber, executive director of the National Abstinence Education Association, which hopes to kick off its online service for teenagers next year.

Those who run digital programs say they simply want teens to have accurate information, to help them make good decisions. Even though popular culture is saturated with sex, facts and advice can be hard to find.

Few disagree about the need for more education. Although the teenage birth rate dropped 9 percent in 2010 from 2009, the United States still has one of the highest rates among developed countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rates of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia among American teenagers continue to rise.

Most online services receive grants from philanthropies, like the Ford Foundation, and health and education agencies on the state and federal level. Classroom content is largely controlled by school districts, but it is a low priority in many areas. Chicago, for example, does not have a mandated sex education curriculum, although teachers are encouraged to include material in science or physical education classes. School officials see programs like Sex-Ed Loop, which began in September, as vital.

Mary Beth Szydlowski, the H.I.V. education prevention specialist for Chicago schools, said that Sex-Ed Loop not only reinforces what students learn in class but can reach all teenagers, including dropouts. It is managed by the Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, which enlists Chicago teenagers to create the text messages as well as blog posts and testimonial videos for its site.

Juan Chavez, 19, a sophomore at DePaul University, remembers sex education during ninth-grade health class as awkward.

“The teacher had been a nutrition major,” Mr. Chavez said. “He was really uncomfortable. He just said, ‘I don’t believe you guys should be having sex, so I’ll just say this because I have to.’ ”

Now, through the Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, Mr. Chavez texts and blogs, with a focus on gay teenagers, about such subjects as what to do if a condom breaks, which clinics are gay-friendly and where to find low-cost lubricants — “things people need to know on the fly,” he said.

Parents who fear that sex education will encourage a child to experiment are misguided, said Elizabeth Schroeder, executive director of Answer, a national sex education organization that oversees Sexetc. Studies show the opposite is true, she said.

But making sure that Web-surfing teenagers find these programs, rather than pornographic sites, has been challenging.

Leslie Kantor, vice president for education at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said it was expanding its chat program, which teenagers can use with handheld devices or online. The organization is trying, she said, to embed material with search terms used by teenagers.

“How do I write content that says ‘sex’ 80,000 times so our page will pop up in a kid’s search on Google near the top?” she said.

When it comes to marketing, programs are increasingly relying on the customer: teenagers.

Real Talk held a classroom contest to see which student could send the most texts containing this prevention message: “ROFL!!!” (Translation: rolling on the floor laughing). “STDs and HIV can spread as fast as this message. Still laughing? Pass on the message not HIV/STDs. 518-HIV-TEST.” Within an hour, the message had been sent to nearly 450 phones.",31/12/2011
The New York Times,Ebola Evolved Into Deadlier Enemy During the African Epidemic,"The Ebola epidemic that tore through West Africa in 2014 claimed 11,310 lives, far more than any previous outbreak. A combination of factors contributed to its savagery, among them a mobile population, crumbling public health systems, official neglect and hazardous burial practices.

But new research suggests another impetus: The virus may have evolved a new weapon against its human hosts. In studies published on Thursday in the journal Cell, two teams of scientists report that a genetic mutation may have made Ebola more deadly by improving the virus’s ability to enter human cells.

The researchers do not yet understand exactly how it works, but several lines of evidence suggest it helped expand the scope of the epidemic. One alarming finding: Patients infected with the mutated version of Ebola were significantly more likely to die.

“It’s hard to escape the conclusion that it’s an adaptation to the human host,” said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and an author of one of the new studies.",04/11/2016
The New York Times,"For First Time, AIDS Vaccine Shows Some Success","“We often talk about whether a vaccine is even possible,” said Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, or AVAC. “This is not the vaccine that ends the epidemic and says, ‘O.K., let’s move on to something else.’ But it’s a fabulous new step that takes us in a new direction.”

In which direction is still unknown. No one — including the researchers from the United States Army , the National Institutes of Health , the Thai Ministry of Public Health and two vaccine companies that tested the vaccine — knows why the vaccine gave even its weak indicator of success.

Experts generally disdain vaccines that do not protect at least 70 to 80 percent of those getting them. And this vaccine did not lower the viral loads of people who were vaccinated but caught the virus anyway, which was baffling because even mismatched vaccines usually do that.

Simply repeating the trial to confirm the results would be pointless, experts agreed.

The trial, the largest AIDS vaccine trial in history, cost $105 million and followed 16,402 Thai volunteers.

The men and women ages 18 to 30 were recruited from two provinces southeast of the capital, Bangkok , from the general population rather than from high-risk groups like drug injectors or sex workers. Half got six doses of two different vaccines; half were given placebos.

For ethical reasons, all were offered condoms , taught how to avoid infection and promised lifelong antiretroviral treatment if they got AIDS. They were then regularly tested for three years; 74 of those who got placebos became infected, but only 51 of those who got the vaccines did.

Although the difference was a mere 23 people, Col. Jerome H. Kim, a physician and the manager of the Army ’s H.I.V. vaccine program, said it was statistically significant and meant that the vaccine was 31.2 percent effective.

The results were surprising because both vaccines, one from the French company Sanofi-Aventis and one developed by Genentech but now licensed to Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit health group, had failed when used individually.

“This came out of the blue,” said Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi’s chief executive. Even 31 percent protection “was at least twice as good as our own internal experts were predicting,” he added.

In 2004, there was so much skepticism about the trial just after it began that 22 top AIDS researchers published an editorial in Science magazine suggesting that it was a waste of money.

One conclusion from the surprising result, said Alan Bernstein, head of the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, an alliance of organizations pursuing a vaccine, “is that we’re not doing enough work in humans.”

Instead of going back to mice or monkeys, he said, different new variants on the two vaccines could be tried on a few hundred people in several countries.

This vaccine was designed to combat the most common strain of the virus in Southeast Asia, so it would have to be modified for the strains circulating in Africa and the United States .

Sanofi’s vaccine, Alvac-HIV, is a canarypox virus with three AIDS virus genes grafted onto it. Variations of it were tested in several countries; it was safe but not protective. The other vaccine, Aidsvax, was originally made by Genentech and contains a protein found on the surface of the AIDS virus; it is grown in a broth of hamster ovary cells. It was tested in Thai drug users in 2003 and in gay men in North America and Europe but failed.

In 2007, two trials of a Merck vaccine in about 4,000 people were stopped early; it not only failed to work but for some men also seemed to increase the risk of infection.

Combining Alvac and Aidsvax was simply a hunch: if one was designed to create antibodies and the other to alert white blood cells, might they work together?

One puzzling result — those who became infected had as much virus in their blood whether they got the vaccine or a placebo — suggests that RV 144 does not produce neutralizing antibodies, as most vaccines do, Dr. Fauci said. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins formed by the body that clump onto invading viruses, blocking the surface spikes with which they attach to cells and flagging them for destruction.

Instead, he theorized, it might produce “binding antibodies,” which latch onto and empower effector cells, a type of white blood cell attacking the virus. Therefore, he said, it might make sense to screen all the stored Thai blood samples for binding antibodies.

“The humbling prospect of this,” he said, “is that we may not even be measuring the critical parameter. It may be something you don’t normally associate with protection.”",25/09/2009
The New York Times,China Calls for Expanded Use of Condoms,"HONG KONG — China has just issued a new “action plan” to combat the rising spread of H.I.V. and AIDS, and this seems to be the takeaway: Condoms or condom vending machines should be available in 95 percent of the country’s hotels by 2015.

The plan by the State Council, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, “urged comprehensive intervention to prevent H.I.V./AIDS infection through sexual intercourse, as intercourse has become the most common transmission channel in China.”

China’s “overall burden” from H.I.V. and AIDS cases is low, according to the World Health Organization office in Beijing. But the numbers of reported cases in China are rising as heterosexual transmission surpasses injection drug use as the No. 1 cause of infection.

“There is still time for China to slow the spread of HIV and to prevent a wider epidemic,” a W.H.O. bulletin said. “Concerted, scaled-up prevention efforts are needed to ensure universal access to condoms, clean needles and other protective measures.”

Government figures say the country has about 780,000 people living with H.I.V./AIDS, including 154,000 AIDS patients.

The government wants AIDS deaths to decrease 30 percent by 2015, with new infections dropping 25 percent and total infections maxxing out at 1.2 million by 2015.

Michel Sidibé, executive director of the United Nations’ AIDS prevention agency, has lobbied China, South Africa, India and Russia to energize (or in some cases reverse) their approaches to the epidemic, as my colleague Donald G. McNeil Jr. reported in a recent profile of Mr. Sidibé.

“He pressed China to admit that H.I.V. was spreading rapidly among gay men and drug users,” Donald wrote, “and that the 500,000 Chinese working in Africa and 40 million migrant laborers, many of whom visit prostitutes, were potential risk pools.”",04/03/2012
The New York Times,What We Can Do to Help,"One of the most common comments we get goes: “What can I do to help? You guys talk so much about the problems, and now I want to do something.” I don’t like to bring up problems without proposing solutions. In this second-to-last entry, I propose concrete action steps to channel passion and idealism into activism and action.

Be forewarned that I don’t think that giving money is usually the best way to help. I believe that education, awareness and tangible actions multiple many times over. They are actions that, during your lifetime, will far outweigh infrequent monetary contributions. An aid worker at HEAL Africa summarized my thoughts when she said, “It’s too easy to give money and feel like you’ve helped. Doing something shouldn’t be about relieving your guilty conscience.” That said, there are many humanitarian organizations doing great things that rely on donor funds, and I do hope that you consider supporting them. I am just proposing other ways to help beyond monetary contributions.

1) Educate yourself

Exposure to and understanding of issues is the most important, and most fundamental step, of “doing something” to help. Broaden your understanding through reading and traveling. Your voice as an activist will be much stronger if assertions are backed by evidence, and if your passion and conviction is grounded in reality.

Keep the big picture in mind. I agree with Dr. Paul Farmer that too many HIV/AIDS activists ask only for more money for HIV/AIDS while neglecting related issues like malaria, malnutrition, and primary healthcare. HIV funding should not be decreased, but rather, funding should take into account the big picture to develop a “horizontal” approach to improving overall healthcare.

Spend time abroad if you can. Nick often says that a college education is not complete without spending some time in a developing country: “How can you consider yourself educated if you do not know how 1/3 of humanity lives?” For young people, there are many opportunities to volunteer or work abroad. Consider programs like the Peace Corps and National Security Education Program. Seek out internship opportunities at an U.N. agency, NGO, or religious charity organization. Study abroad. Teach English. For those past college-age, there are similar types of opportunities available with NGOs.

2) Educate others

Once you understand the issues and have spent time abroad, use your social and professional networks to educate others and share ideas. You have more networks than you might think. Forward articles to help educate family and friends. Join discussion forums. If you worked abroad or spent time researching an issue, seek opportunities in your community to give talks.

Join associations. Consider professional organizations that focus on service and advocacy. For physicians-in-training, groups like the American Medical Student Association and National Physicians Alliance are organizations that promote discussion of international health issues, service opportunities, and advocacy and lobbying. Groups like these also provide a forum for you to bring up ideas, and to receive advice from others about opportunities to assist and contribute.

3) Take action

Assist existing humanitarian aid groups. There are many excellent aid organizations worthy of your investment or volunteer time. We have listed some of the groups in the “blog roll”, and encourage that you check these out and look into other options as well. The projects I am most inspired by include ones that focus on capacity-building, peace and reconciliation, long-term economic development, community-oriented public health, education, and women’s empowerment. Horizontal programs that don’t pinpoint only one disease or only one intervention are relatively rare, but particularly effective, in addressing systemic problems.

I am also impressed by organizations that take a need-based approach to critically examine community needs. Aya Shneerson of the World Food Program talked to us about her frustrations with groups that start with the opposite approach, “It should not be about what aid groups can offer. It’s all about what the people need.” Rwanda’s President Kagame also had mixed feelings about NGOs, and said that while their overall benefit is positive, they often bring in their own agendas.

Lobby your legislators. It’s not because of politicians that the U.S. is not doing enough to help Africa or to stop the war in the Congo. It’s because we have not, as a country, expressed interest in global issues. Let’s show our legislators that we care about international health, ongoing wars, and global poverty. Let’s place public health and international development as top priorities in our foreign policy agenda. My next blog entry will mention more specifics about what our government should do; ultimately it is us who will propel our government to action.

Finally, remember that problems don’t exist just in Africa; ­injustices exist everywhere. Social activism is not limited just to the places “over there”; there are many opportunities to assist no matter where you are. Insecurity is not limited just to war-torn areas; there are destructive people and destructive values that exist in our own backyard. There is a lot we can do by assisting our own communities. Part of being globally conscious involves striving to help all those around us, to the best of our abilities, every single day.

The New York Times,Three Things to Watch This Week,"‘Younger’

When to watch: Tuesday at 10 p.m., on TVLand

“Younger” has been fabulous this season, especially because the writers finally decided to let the cast sing, even just a little. Sutton Foster sang a song from “The Sound of Music” earlier this season in a moment that was charming but contrived, like the show itself. This week, it’s Miriam Shor’s turn, and she duets with the guest star Martha Plimpton. Next week is the season finale, so savor this episode like the last day of summer vacation. Maybe Hilary Duff will get her big musical number in Season 6.

The New York Times,"Tory Dent, Poet Who Wrote of Living With H.I.V., Dies at 47","Tory Dent, a poet, essayist and art critic whose verse told of life with a diagnosis of H.I.V. and of the struggle to keep her creativity alive, died last Friday at her home in the East Village. She was 47.

The death was announced by her husband, Sean Harvey. The cause was an opportunistic infection associated with AIDS, to which her condition had progressed about nine years ago.

Since she was found to be H.I.V-positive at the age of 30, Ms. Dent published three volumes of her poetry. ""What Silence Equals"" (Persea Books), which came out in 1993, was followed by ""HIV, Mon Amour"" (Sheep Meadow Press), in 2000. The third, ""Black Milk"" (Sheep Meadow), appeared in 2005, just weeks before her death.

""HIV, Mon Amour"" drew a great deal of attention and won several awards, including the James Laughlin Award of the Academy of American Poets. It contained unflinching, graphically detailed verse accounts of her fight with the disease, the unending medical appointments she endured and a daily existence lived in defiance of it.

The New York Times,‘Little Dorito’ and More: Suggestions for Literary Product Placement,"A blogger’s recent discovery that a 99-cent e-book version of “War and Peace” sold in Barnes and Noble’s Nook Store had replaced every instance of the ordinary English word “kindle” with the word “Nook” prompted much online tittering about the wisdom of outsourcing book digitization to a company named Superior Formatting Publishing as well as reminders of the deep roots of literary product placement. (When Jules Verne began serializing “Around the World in 80 Days” in 1872 shipping companies lobbied to be name-checked in the text.)

But for the keepers of “Questioningly,” the New Yorker’s weekly Twitter-based contest, the glitch was also an opening. Last Friday they invited readers to offer their own corporate-literary mash-ups. And now, the results are in.

The contest drew multiple entries for “Gone With the Windex,” “Slaughterhouse Five-Guys,” and “Midnight in the Olive Garden of Good and Evil,” along with at least one pitch for “One Flew Over the Condé Nast,” a reference to the New Yorker’s parent company. But ultimately the judges cast aside “Little Dorito,” “Less than Xerox,” “Remembrance of Things Pabst,” and “Pninterest” to proclaim “Bayerwulf” the winner.

“Everyone guffawed,” Ben Greenman, the contest organizer, said in an e-mail. “Some almost spit-took. I guess the compactness of it pleased people and also the absurdity of the collision — Old English heroic poem meets tiny aspirin tablets.”

The New Yorker contest, which previously invited readers to choose the most annoying word in English or summarize “Star Wars” in a single Twitter message, is closed, but readers with deep pockets still have time to corrupt the literary enterprise. Until Tuesday the online auction site Charity Buzz is accepting bids to have yourself or a loved one appear as a character in the forthcoming John Grisham novel.

The New York Times,Possible Mold in the Walls and an Unresponsive Board,"A. Mold is serious and needs to be taken care of. Although black mold is toxic, common molds can be harmful to your health, too. If you are allergic to mold, it could cause a reaction or exacerbate asthma, and if your immune system is compromised from an illness like HIV or AIDS, such exposure could pose a serious health threat, said Dr. Louis DePalo, a pulmonology professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Even if the mold does not bother you now, you should still insist on removing it because “if you continue to live in that space, you might develop an allergy” to mold eventually, Dr. DePalo said. So how do you make sure the mold is really gone? You need the board to step up because fixing this is the board’s responsibility. The licensing agreement is between the board and the developer, and the board is responsible for problems within the walls, according to Robert J. Braverman, a real estate lawyer. “It is the board, not you, that is in a position to enforce the terms of the agreement” with the developer, Mr. Braverman said.

Because mold was discovered in your walls, there is a good chance that reports exist identifying the type of mold and the extent of the problem. Keep pressing the board to get hold of those reports, and any remediation reports, too, reminding the board that this is its responsibility.",03/02/2018

The New York Times,The Price of Dinner,"My final days in St. Louis have been filled with excitement, anticipation, and trepidation. How does this “win-a-trip” really work, and what would it be like to work with Nick Kristof? What should we expect, and what unexpected challenges will we face? How much DEET and how many pairs of underwear should I pack? What will I write about, and how should I figure out “my” approach? How can I best convey what I see and hear to you, our readers?

I sought the advice of friends and colleagues, fellow activists in the fight for global health justice. Many brought up specific issues that they hoped I would write about: the scourge of HIV/AIDS; the dearth of healthcare workers; the lack of access to essential and life-saving medications; the effects of poverty on health and disease; the efficacy of and need for foreign aid; the responsibility of governments and international community to address global public health. But as the countdown to the trip continued, I still did not know what to write or how to approach it.

The answer came for the price of a dinner. Before I left for New York City en route to Africa, I went out to a Thai restaurant with a good friend and fellow activist medical student. The conversation was great, the food was delicious, and my friend, ever the gentleman, insisted on paying the bill. He then sent me the following email. I think it’s a fitting place to begin my blog:

“I want you to write about the price of our dinner this evening.

In total, the cost of our appetizer, entrees, tax, and 20 percent tip came to $25 for the two of us — a fairly modest dinner outing by US standards and well within the means of most people here. My challenge to you is this: during your journey, find out what this amount of money and other similar expenditures you make during your travels would have purchased for people residing in the nations and communities you visit.

For $25, how many people could have afforded to buy their daily ration of food? How many lifesaving doses of drugs for malaria or HIV or childhood vaccines could have been administered? How many textbooks or protective gloves or medical equipment for the healthcare workers could have been purchased?”

Neither my friend nor I believe that guilt is the way to achieve meaningful change. If we had not gone to our dinner, would the $25 have gone directly to feed starving children and provide mosquito nets? Probably not. His point, and what I now identify as my goal on this reporting trip, is that we need to find ways to translate the problems “over there”, in sub-Saharan Africa, to ways that are understandable “over here”, in the U.S.

My approach on this trip will be to communicate seemingly abstract concepts like “poverty in Africa” or “global neglected diseases” through telling stories. Unlike cold numbers and hard statistics, stories are about about real people, going through real challenges, and trying to overcome real difficulties. Indeed, finding out people’s stories is why I went into medicine, and learning how to communicate them is why I applied for this trip. Medical school taught me to listen to my patients and to serve as their advocate. I hope to now learn to share their stories with the world, and to find links between their stories and yours, beginning with the price of dinner.

The New York Times,Debating Circumcision and Consent,"Two pro, two con, one “it’s complicated.” That’s the breakdown of Room for Debate’s discussion of whether there should be an age of consent for circumcision, a procedure performed by observant Jews and Muslims for religious reasons, but also by a majority of American families until relatively recently. (During the 1980s and ’90s, about two-thirds of infant boys were circumcised, but in recent years, that number appears to have dropped to less than half.)

Did those parents who chose circumcision “make martyrs of their children” with “irrevocable genital amputations” as John V. Geisheker of Doctors Opposing Circumcision argues?

One reason this is such a difficult question to consider is the past prevalence of the procedure. As Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz wrote last year in the Chicago Tribune, “for decades, American parents were on circumcision autopilot.”

“Conventional wisdom held that the foreskin-free penis was healthier and cleaner,” she wrote. “Everyone was doing it, so everyone had it done.”

A court in Cologne, Germany, recently ruled that parents could not have boys circumcised unless there was an urgent medical need. A similar law was proposed in San Francisco last year, but the ballot initiative never came to a vote. The American Academy of Pediatrics remains neutral, offering reasons for and against the procedure, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been considering updating its neutrality since 2009, particularly in light of research into its value in HIV prevention.

Those who argue against circumcision often liken it to female genital mutilation, while those in favor of parents’ making the choice for their sons cite religious freedom. For me personally, this ship has sailed (and out of respect for my sons’ privacy, I think I’ll omit any mention of the direction it took). I do find it hard to imagine making circumcision illegal, and hard, too, to equate it with female genital mutilation or enforced martyrdom. But I’m open to the possibility that my ideas may be outdated, and colored by what, in my lifetime, has always been the status quo.

Civil comments and thoughts are welcome here, and on the various viewpoints at Room for Debate. Is it time to rethink circumcision, and how?",12/07/2012
The New York Times,India Leads World in Deaths of Children Under Five,"Adnan Abidi/Reuters

The world welcomed a piece of good news today: The number of children dying under the age of 5 has steadily dropped over two decades, according to a report by United Nations Children’s Fund.

In India, that news was tempered by the fact that the country accounts for a significant number of those deaths.

Across the world, the number of children dying under the age of 5 was estimated to be 6.9 million last year — a notable drop from almost 12 million in 1990. The decline is attributed to effective interventions to fight diseases like measles, malaria and polio, as well as HIV.

With 1.7 million under-5 deaths, India alone accounts for nearly a quarter of those deaths worldwide, according to Unicef. Although the number of such deaths has fallen in India over the years, the pace of the decline has been much slower than in other countries.

“The decline has been insufficient,” said Pavitra Mohan, a health specialist with Unicef in India “Based on the current trend, it appears unlikely that India will achieve the Millennium Development Goals” set by the United Nations.

Mr. Mohan said India has had the highest number of under-5 deaths for years partly because of the sheer number of births in the country. He notes that roughly a quarter of those deaths are in the populous state of Uttar Pradesh.

Mr. Mohan said the killers in India include infections and low birth weight that plague babies in their first month, and diarrhea and pneumonia once they’re older. The government and development agencies have responded by expanding community-based intervention, newborn care in households and treatment of diarrhea and pneumonia, he said.

In Thursday’s report, Unicef said that under-5 deaths are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In 2011, 82 percent of under-5 deaths occurred in these two regions, up from 68 percent two decades before, the agency noted.

“The global decline in under-5 mortality is a significant success,” Unicef’s executive director, Anthony Lake, said in the report. “But there is also unfinished business: Millions of children under 5 are still dying each year from largely preventable causes for which there are proven, affordable interventions.”",13/09/2012
The New York Times,"Putting the Swag, Not the Swagger, Back in Media","Somewhere near the bottom of the crater in the publishing economy, there is a lot of wreckage and at least two items of treasure: One is all the talented people who have been pushed out by flight of spending on magazines, Web sites and newspapers. And the other? All the swag they collected during the golden days of a-party-every-night and the huge bags of stuff on the way out the door.

This Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Fontana’s NYC, the ASSME, or American Society of (Recently Fired) Media Elites –- the group’s actual name doesn’t render very well in New York Timesland –- will hold a raffle of those tchotchkes its members no longer hold dear, including an American Idol gumball machine, a pristine unopened Spice Girls pin, a Jack Bauer action figure (mug shot not included), a set of Being John Malkovich nesting dolls and the ever popular Pee Wee’s Playhouse mini backpack.

One hundred percent of the proceeds will go toward supporting homeless people with AIDS and HIV. The swagless will be asked for a $5 donation.

“In part it’s an attempt to put things in perspective, a reminder to those of us in a beleaguered industry that no matter how dark it looks, there are plenty of people out there facing bigger struggles,” said Aaron Gell, president of ASSME.

Those who are still employed in media industries might want to scan their desk and decide, “Do I really need that ‘Dexter’ bobblehead or might it enjoy a better home?” And those who count themselves as recently dispossessed can finally get around to opening up that cardboard box from their old job that they got handed along with a pink slip and find gold at the bottom, like a dusty but perfectly fine Pets.com onesie. It may lead to some spirited bidding: How can you even put a price on a “Dancing With the Stars” headband?",23/06/2009
The New York Times,Where to Stream Jonathan Demme Movies,"Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation website.

Jonathan Demme, who died Wednesday at age 73, was a filmmaker who was comfortable working across several genres. He made family dramas like “Rachel Getting Married,” terrifying suspense movies like “Silence of the Lambs” and cutesy romantic comedies like “Married to the Mob.” Demme was also cool enough to capture the essence of performers like Justin Timberlake, Neil Young and the Talking Heads in several lively concert movies.

If you have no idea where or what to start watching from his lengthy career, here are some highlights currently available to stream on subscription services or to rent on digital platforms:

Demme is possibly best known for this 1991 film that earned him a best director Oscar, but this horror-thriller starring Jodie Foster as an F.B.I. trainee and Anthony Hopkins as a legendary (and imprisoned) serial killer is an outlier in his filmography. It won five top Oscars — best picture, director, actor, actress and adapted screenplay — and was a box office hit.

One of the purest expressions of joy and exultation ever committed to film, “Stop Making Sense” is the concert doc par excellence. In capturing one landmark show from the art-rock gods Talking Heads (and in stuffing frontman David Byrne in that instantly classic oversized white suit), Demme created a monument to the transcendent powers of rock and roll.

Updated from the Cold War settings of the original to those of the Persian Gulf war of 1991, the film’s creepy premise remains intensely suspenseful.

Aside from providing a chance to get up close and personal with the most charismatic man currently working in pop music, Demme’s final film makes for a satisfying coda to a cinematic career marked by an overflowing, guileless love for the binding powers of live performance.

The first of three documentaries in which Neil Young was a subject for Demme, “Heart of Gold” may be the most disarmingly poignant of the three. The film was shot shortly after the making of “Prairie Wind,” which Young recorded right before and after his double surgery for a cerebral aneurysm and just after the death of his father. The homespun songs in “Heart of Gold,” filmed across two of Young’s concerts from that time, come from a man feeling the weight of the ages but still charged with life force. More plaintive than most of Demme’s music-world work, the film doubles as a biopic and an audiovisual experience.",26/04/2017
The New York Times,Opinion | Free Speech and an Anti-Prostitution Pledge at the Supreme Court,"A 2003 federal statute, called the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act, finances a wide range of public health initiatives to treat and prevent disease around the world.

That law prohibits the use of any government money to “promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution.” But it also goes beyond that reasonable provision to require almost all recipients of funds to “have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution” — to make an anti-prostitution pledge — and to refrain from any speech the government deems “inconsistent with” the policy.

On Monday, in Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on whether this provision violates the recipients’ First Amendment right to freedom of expression. It clearly does by requiring them to speak and advocate the government’s position, without the option of staying silent. This provision could also hurt outreach programs by undermining trust with sex workers, who may avoid seeking help from organizations with a declared anti-prostitution agenda.

The government contends that placing a condition on federal dollars is a legitimate way to promote its policies and those who do not want to make an explicit pledge can avoid it by not taking government money.",23/04/2013
The New York Times,World Briefing | Africa: South Africa: Minister Defends Garlic Aids Diet,"The minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimangagain, insisted that a diet of garlic, olive oil and lemon juice helps fend off the effects of AIDS, repeating a message denounced last year by a leading national medical journal as ''ill-considered advice'' not backed up by scientific data. Ms. Tshabalala-Msimang scolded reporters at a parliamentary briefing for their earlier ridicule of her prescription, saying that the three ingredients are ''absolutely critical'' to boosting the immune system and that as little as a monthly teaspoon of olive oil would reap benefits. Like President Thabo Mbeki, she has cast doubt on what most scientists call an irrefutable link between the HIV virus and AIDS. Estimates vary, but at least one in 10 South Africans is H.I.V.-positive. Michael Wines (NYT)",10/02/2004
The New York Times,Novartis and Penn Unite On Anticancer Approach,"The drugmaker Novartis and the University of Pennsylvania announced a research and licensing agreement early Monday that aims to bring to market a new approach to fighting cancer that has shown promising results in early trials.

The alliance seeks to build on the recent results of an experimental treatment that trains a person’s immune system to kill cancer cells. Scientists at the university announced last year significant results in several patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were treated using the new technique, including two who went into complete remission.

The treatment uses a disabled form of the HIV-1 virus to carry cancer-fighting genes into the patients’ T-cells, a type of white blood cell that fights viruses and tumors. Although the study involved patients with leukemia, researchers hope to apply the approach to treat patients with a variety of cancers. Other trials are under way for lymphoma, mesothelioma, myeloma and neuroblastoma.

A spokeswoman for Penn declined to comment on the financial details of the arrangement, but included in the deal is a commitment by Novartis to contribute $20 million to build the Center for Advanced Cellular Therapies, which will be devoted to studying the new treatments, on the campus.

Novartis and Penn say the deal will combine the intellectual resources of the university with the commercial wherewithal of the company, a major drugmaker. Penn is granting Novartis an exclusive worldwide license to the technologies, and Penn will receive royalty payments.

“Penn’s intellectual resources, combined with a pharmaceutical industry leader like Novartis, offer a powerful symbiotic relationship in our mutual goal of finding more effective treatments for cancer,” J. Larry Jameson, dean of the Perelman School of the Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and executive vice president for the Health System, said in a statement announcing the deal.

The arrangement is being announced as major pharmaceutical companies are cutting back on their deals with biotech firms and collaborating increasingly with universities instead. Agreements between pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies totaled $18.9 billion in the first seven months of this year, a decline from the $22.7 billion in deals that were done over the same period a year ago, according to a recent report by the venture capital firm Burrill & Company.",06/08/2012
The New York Times,Want to Help Treat AIDS in Africa? Buy a Cellphone,"Mr. Gates said he was at first skeptical that the group would be able to persuade large retailers to participate. “I wasn’t sure they would get enough companies on board to make Red a viable entity, and whether it could generate enough revenue for the global fund to make it worthwhile,” he said. “I was pleasantly surprised on both counts.”

The Red retailers are embracing a brand that is not their own, a move retailers are usually loath to do, and Red products will sit at the heart of the companies’ collections rather than in small baskets on check-out counters. The Global Fund and Red say they intend for the retailers to pocket a profit on Red products.

“Gap in the beginning couldn’t understand how they were going to make money,” Mr. Shriver said. “They wanted to do a T-shirt and give us all the money. But, we want them to make money. We don’t want anyone to be thinking, ‘I’m not making money on this thing,’ because then we failed. We want people buying houses in the Hamptons based on this because, if that happens, this thing is sustainable.”

Red products have been in stores in Britain since February, and the share of profits that has gone to the fund passed the $10 million mark last month, said Richard Feachem, the executive director of the Global Fund. That is twice what the fund received from companies and individuals from 2002 to 2006, he said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been the largest nongovernmental donor to the fund, pledging $650 million.

“I could go with my begging bowl every year to a major corporation and say ‘give me some money,’ and they might give me a one-off contribution, but it wouldn’t be large and it wouldn’t be sustainable,” Dr. Feachem said. “Red is intrinsically sustainable because Red is good for the companies.”

With the $10 million it has earned so far from Red, the fund is financing testing and treatment of HIV-positive women and children in Rwanda and is taking care of orphans in Swaziland whose parents died of AIDS, Dr. Feachem said.

HIV infection has exploded in developing countries in the past decade. The fund plans to dedicate money from Red solely to help people in Africa, which has the world’s highest percentage of HIV-positive adults, according to Dr. Feachem. But there are also substantial AIDS problems in other countries like China and India, which has the highest number of people infected with HIV, Dr. Feachem added.

The cost of AIDS medications has fallen in recent years in part because of negotiations with several pharmaceutical companies, led by former President Bill Clinton. Today, medical care for one person costs about $1,000 a year, and there are about five million people in Africa who need treatment, Dr. Feachem said. That puts the bill to treat them all at $5 billion a year.

The fund has received $5.7 billion over the last four years, and an additional $4.3 billion, mostly from governments, has been promised. The United States contributes about $600 million a year.

Income from Red will not close the budget gap, but its money will certainly help, said Tommy G. Thompson, the former secretary of health and human services and current honorary chairman of the Global Fund.

“The reason the private sector’s got to be involved is there’s just not enough money coming in from the government,” Mr. Thompson said. “This is a huge thing and the demand and the need is so great that we just don’t have enough money coming in from the governments to do it.”

The retailers selling Red items have gone to great lengths to link the products to Africa. Gap has produced several of its Red items at its factory in Lesotho. American Express carries writing on its red-color card, now available only in Britain, that says: “This card is designed to help eliminate AIDS in Africa.” Motorola is manufacturing some of its Red phones in Nigeria.

Converse, too, has incorporated African themes into its Red line. One of the company’s shoes is made of Mali mud cloth, a traditional woven cotton fabric that is painted with dyes made of mud and bark, said David Maddocks, the chief marketing officer at Converse, which is owned by Nike.

While Bono and Mr. Shriver had to persuade some of the retailers to participate, Motorola competed with other wireless companies to be included. Motorola and the other partner companies are paying Red a licensing fee, which helps cover Red’s administrative expenses, and are donating part of their profits to the Global Fund.

The amounts donated in the United States vary, but Converse is giving Red 15 percent of the revenue from its shoes sold online, Mr. Maddocks said. Motorola and a wireless partner whose identity Motorola is to announce on Oct. 13 plan to together donate $44.50 for each Motokrzr phone sold, said Alan Buddendeck, a Motorola spokesman.

“I don’t believe it’s giving up profit. What I believe it is, is making more profit,” said Ron G. Garriques, president of mobile devices at Motorola.

Bono and Mr. Shriver have persuaded some celebrities, like Chris Rock, Edward Norton and Leonardo DiCaprio, to pitch Red products in print and on TV spots posted on the Red Web site, www.joinred.com. Gap and the other retailers are paying for their own promotions of Red products. Mr. Shriver said he hoped other retailers, particularly those with large marketing budgets, would join. Next, he said, he would like to recruit a cosmetics company.

“We’d like to have an everyday product,” Mr. Shriver said. “So that people can feel that for three bucks they can participate.”

While the retailers have committed to sell Red products for five years, the success of the campaign will depend on whether customers continue buying the products, supporters acknowledged.

“Ultimately, this idea lives or dies with the consumer — if they like it and buy Red, then it’s here to stay,” Mr. Clinton said in an e-mail message.

One long-lasting charity brand is Newman’s Own, a company co-founded by the actor Paul Newman in 1982 to raise money for charities. Kirsten McKamy, public relations manager for Newman’s Own, said the key was for consumers to buy the products because they liked them, rather than purely to give money to charity.

“Mr. Newman knew from the start that ‘Yes, I can put my face on the product, people will buy it, but they’re not going to come back if it’s not good,’ ” Ms. McKamy said. “The more money the company gives to Mr. Newman every year to give away, the happier we are. That’s the reason we’re in business.”",04/10/2006

The New York Times,H.I.V. Strain Adds Urgency to Changes in City AIDS Program,"Despite the complexity of routinely getting such information, it could be done, Dr. Frieden said.

Dr. Guthrie S. Birkhead, director of the New York State Health Department's AIDS Institute, said he discussed the measure with Dr. Frieden and was open to considering changing state law. However, Dr. Birkhead and Dr. Frieden said they recognized that because laboratories do not use a standard format to report test results, collecting the data could prove extremely difficult.

Dr. Frieden said he also wanted the state to require all laboratories across the country that test newly infected New York City residents to report whether they have strains of the virus that respond to medication to improve tracking the disease and to provide feedback to doctors about the best treatment for their patients.

Immediately after the rare H.I.V. strain was reported to the department, Dr. Frieden said he asked the dozen or so laboratories licensed by the state to check their records for any other patients with the same strain of the virus.

Dr. Birkhead said the city and state were currently allowed to collect such data under limited powers granted to prevent the outbreak of a new disease. The state would be open to the idea of testing newly infected H.I.V. patients to see what medication they respond to, he said, if it decided a case was worthy.

Dr. Frieden is seeking certain specific information: of all people on treatment, how many remain on treatment a few months later; what proportion of them return to school or work; what proportion of those stop treatment because of bad reactions; and how many of them die.

More broadly, the city's health officials are trying to fight complacency about the spread and danger of AIDS and to change the way people think about the disease. Concerned that the public and medical providers have come to see the disease as just another chronic condition, Dr. Frieden said that an act as simple as changing the name of the department's AIDS unit was important.

The unit had been called the Bureau of HIV/AIDS Services, and it will now be named the Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.

While proposals to restructure the AIDS bureau have been in the planning stages for months, they gained added urgency after the city announced last week that a strain of H.I.V. had been found that showed resistance to multiple drugs and possibly led to the rapid onset of AIDS in a New York City man, perhaps in as few as two months.

How far the strain has spread is unknown, but investigators are actively trying to track down the infected man's partners. One person briefed on the case said the man slept with hundreds of people in the fall of 2004. So far, investigators have contacted about a dozen people they believe had sexual contact with him.

But Dr. Frieden noted that changes in the program have been studied for more than a year.

Some eighteen months ago the city appointed a commission to study how the health department dealt with HIV and AIDS, and the commission is expected to issue its report this spring.

Dr. Frieden has been criticized recently for issuing a citywide alarm after finding the new strain in just one patient, whose own immune system may have made the strain seem more virulent. But he defended his action, saying the man ""has one of the most resistant strains that has been seen"" and had unprotected sex with many partners.

Still, Dr. Frieden said that despite his aggressive approach in this case and the proposals for changing the department's approach to AIDS prevention and treatment, patient privacy remained paramount.

""Confidentiality is a core and supremely important concept here,"" he said.",16/02/2005
The New York Times,Showcase: An African Panorama,"Take a generous serving of fresh art. Season liberally with food.

That was the unusual formula devised 10 years ago in Seattle by the photographer Casey Kelbaugh to create communities around art projects. The format, known as a Slideluck Potshow, involves a potluck-style dinner followed by slide shows of work by new and established artists.

Naturally, Mr. Kelbaugh, 35, has had the chance to learn about the art and cooking of many cities. But in Nairobi, Kenya, where the most recent event was held, the sense of place was unparalleled.

“You couldn’t confuse it with anywhere else we’ve ever been,” Mr. Kelbaugh said.

The slide shows in Nairobi were grounded in Africa. They included the photography of Paolo Woods, Myriam Abdelaziz and Mariella Furrer, whose black-and-white work on child abuse in South Africa documents the longterm effects of rape on young victims.

[Mr. Woods was profiled on Lens last November in “Iran, Beyond Stereotype.” Ms. Furrer will be the subject of a post on Friday. And the work of Ms. Abdelaziz will be featured on Lens next week.]

Slide shows in New York, where Mr. Kelbaugh now lives, can draw more than 1,000 people. But he wasn’t sure how such an event would be received in Kenya, where neither contemporary art nor potluck dinners are especially well established. Georgina Goodwin, a photographer who was born in Nairobi and served as the show’s local producer, helped him navigate cultural differences.

“We haven’t really had anything like that in Kenya before,” she said. “We’re very starved of stuff like that.”

Ms. Goodwin’s photo essay, “Health and Wealth,” focusing on HIV and malaria in the slums, was one of the slide shows at the event, which drew nearly 400 people.

Georgina Goodwin

The recognition of weighty subjects helps distinguish the series, Mr. Kelbaugh said. Organizers try to balance lighter pieces with nuanced explorations of social issues.

“These moments that punctuate the evening, that really drive home some important point or really take you to a place that’s so far from what you’ve experienced, are really a lot of what we’re about,” he said.",04/03/2010
The New York Times,Two Summer Spots on Rome’s Gay Scene,"ROME | To make the most of Rome’s balmy summer nights, the gay scene migrates to the capital’s suburbs where parking is easier and you can rock on till the wee hours without fearing the complaints of sleep-deprived neighbors.

The scene is split between two principal venues.

Every Friday night until September, the Ecodisco on Lungotevere Maresciallo Diaz, near the Olympic Stadium, will play host to Muccassassina. The weekly disco has been such a hit for nearly two decades that it’s effectively financed the activities of the Mario Mieli association, named after a gay activist who died in 1983.

“We fund legal and psychological assistance, not to mention HIV support initiatives, for our members through the disco,” said Andrea Berardicurti, one of the organizers behind Mario Mieli.

The party starts at 11 p.m. and lasts “until they ask us to shut it down,” usually around 3 a.m., Mr. Berardicurti said. There are two dance halls, once featuring house music (and “go-go boys”), the other offering more commercial fare. International DJ’s do the spinning in both. Information can be found by calling the Mario Mieli Association at 39-06-541-3985 or from the online calender.

Across town, in the EUR neighborhood, Rome’s Gayvillage is a more recent entry into the gay nightlife — but no less animated for it. After some uncertainly, last week city officials finally gave organizers a green light for a new home at the Parco del Turismo, in Via delle Tre Fontane, and the season will kick off on July 2 (it ends on Sept. 6).

The New York Times,Showcase: An African Panorama,"Take a generous serving of fresh art. Season liberally with food.

That was the unusual formula devised 10 years ago in Seattle by the photographer Casey Kelbaugh to create communities around art projects. The format, known as a Slideluck Potshow, involves a potluck-style dinner followed by slide shows of work by new and established artists.

Naturally, Mr. Kelbaugh, 35, has had the chance to learn about the art and cooking of many cities. But in Nairobi, Kenya, where the most recent event was held, the sense of place was unparalleled.

“You couldn’t confuse it with anywhere else we’ve ever been,” Mr. Kelbaugh said.

The slide shows in Nairobi were grounded in Africa. They included the photography of Paolo Woods, Myriam Abdelaziz and Mariella Furrer, whose black-and-white work on child abuse in South Africa documents the longterm effects of rape on young victims.

[Mr. Woods was profiled on Lens last November in “Iran, Beyond Stereotype.” Ms. Furrer will be the subject of a post on Friday. And the work of Ms. Abdelaziz will be featured on Lens next week.]

Slide shows in New York, where Mr. Kelbaugh now lives, can draw more than 1,000 people. But he wasn’t sure how such an event would be received in Kenya, where neither contemporary art nor potluck dinners are especially well established. Georgina Goodwin, a photographer who was born in Nairobi and served as the show’s local producer, helped him navigate cultural differences.

“We haven’t really had anything like that in Kenya before,” she said. “We’re very starved of stuff like that.”

Ms. Goodwin’s photo essay, “Health and Wealth,” focusing on HIV and malaria in the slums, was one of the slide shows at the event, which drew nearly 400 people.

The recognition of weighty subjects helps distinguish the series, Mr. Kelbaugh said. Organizers try to balance lighter pieces with nuanced explorations of social issues.

“These moments that punctuate the evening, that really drive home some important point or really take you to a place that’s so far from what you’ve experienced, are really a lot of what we’re about,” he said.",04/03/2010
The New York Times,Prince Harry Says He Regrets Not Discussing His Mother’s Death,"LONDON — Prince Harry, who was 12 when his mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a car crash, has expressed regret that he did not talk openly about her death for many years.

In comments that were broadcast on Monday by the BBC, Harry, 31, said that he had not discussed his mother’s death until three years ago, and regretted it. He made the comments last Thursday while hosting a barbecue for a mental health charity. The event was attended by star athletes, including the Olympic runner Kelly Holmes and the soccer player Rio Ferdinand.

“I really regret not ever talking about it,” he said, referring to his mother’s death in Paris in August 1997. “For the first 28 years of my life, I never talked about it.” He added: “It is O.K. to suffer, but as long as you talk about it. It is not a weakness. Weakness is having a problem, and not recognizing it, and not solving that problem.”

The prince went on to say that mental illness could affect anyone. “I think the key message here is that everyone can suffer from mental health issues, whether you’re a member of the royal family, whether you’re a soldier, whether you’re a sports star,” he said.",26/07/2016
The New York Times,Democrats Stress Domestic Programs in Debate,"“Let’s face it, if Darfur had a large supply of oil, this administration would be occupying it right now,” said Representative Dennis Kucinich, the Ohio Democrat.

The forum was restrictive, with each of the eight candidates being offered one minute to respond to a question; there was no opportunity for follow-up and the candidates did not get an opportunity to engage one another.

The audience was filled with prominent black leaders, and the candidates — including a black man, a Latino man and a woman — did not begin talking until after 14 minutes of speeches and introductions. Tavis Smiley, a host of a PBS talk show devoted to black issues, moderated the debate.

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York drew loud applause when she denounced the White House for its response to the AIDS epidemic in black America, moments after Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico complimented Mr. Bush’s effort to fund a campaign to curb HIV infection in Africa.

“You know, it is hard to disagree with anything that has been said, but let me just put this in perspective,” Mrs. Clinton said. “If HIV/AIDS were the leading cause of death of white women between the ages of 25 and 34, there would be an outraged outcry in this country.

“If we don’t begin to take it seriously and address it the way we did back in the ’90s, when it was primarily a gay men’s disease, we will never get the services and the public education that we need,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware announced to the audience that he — and Mr. Obama — had been tested for HIV, the virus that caused AIDS: Mr. Obama peered quizzically at Mr. Biden as he shared this information.

“I got tested for AIDS, I know Barack got tested for AIDS,” he said. “There’s no shame in being tested for AIDS. It’s an important thing.”

When it was Mr. Obama’s turn to talk he clarified what Mr. Biden referred to. “Tavis, Tavis, Tavis, I just got to make clear — I got tested with Michelle,” referring to a test with his wife, Michelle, during a visit last summer to Kenya to highlight the medical necessity for wide-spread testing in order to slow the spread of the disease.

“I don’t want any confusion here about what’s going on,” he said with a grin.

Mr. Biden responded: “And I got tested to save my life, because I had 13 pints of blood transfusion.”

The forum opened with Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the state’s first black governor, introducing the candidates. Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama said he did not believe he held an advantage in the debate because he is black. But as the candidates posed for a photograph before the debate, a at least two people in the audience yelled, “Obama!”

That said, none of the candidates’ performances appeared to stand out, and each of the best-known candidates drew relatively similar reactions from the audience.

The first question was whether the candidates thought that race was still a defining issue in America. “You can look at this stage and see an African American, a woman and a Latino contesting to be the president of the United States,” Mrs. Clinton said. “For anyone to assert that race is not a problem in America is ignoring the issue right before their eyes.”

The candidates were pressed to respond to a Supreme Court decision earlier in the day that barred public school systems from explicitly using the race of a student in efforts to achieve or maintain integration. The candidates were unified in denouncing the decision as a setback to racial relationships. Mr. Obama cast himself as a product of the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that found school segregation unconstitutional, and reminded his audience that it was on he Howard campus that the arguments that prevailed in Brown were developed by Thurgood Marshall, then the chief counsel for the NAACP, who was later the first black Supreme Court justice.

“If it hadn’t been for them, I would not be standing here today,” Mr. Obama said. “And it was their fundamental recognition that for us to achieve racial equality was not simply good for African-Americans, but it was good for America as a whole; that we could not be what we might be as a nation unless we healed the brutal wounds of slavery and Jim Crow.”

Mr. Richardson said: “Issues of diversity for me — the first Latino to run for president — aren’t talking points. They are facts of life.”

On the economy, the candidates were unified in calling for a change in policies that they said had hurt the middle class and poor Americans to favor wealthy ones. What we want to do, I think, is live in an America where, no matter who your family is or what the color of your skin or where you’re born, everybody gets the same chance to do well, Mr. Edwards said. And people who have done well ought to have more responsibility to pay back to the country and to the community and those around them.

Mrs. Clinton drew a contrast between the economy today and the economy when Bill Clinton was president. “Our economy was working a lot better in the 1990s,” she said. “When the Bush Administration came in they were determined to tilt the balance back to the privileged — and we are paying a very big price for that.”

And Mr. Obama said: “What people really want is fairness,” he said. “They want people paying their fair share of taxes. They want that money allocated fairly.”

For the first time in the debate, issues of crime and punishment also were raised, with each of the candidates calling for an end to racial disparities in sentencing laws and policing. “We’ll get better justice with Democrats in the White House,” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.",28/06/2007
The New York Times,World Briefing | Europe: Russia: A Call For More Money To Fight Aids,"The country's top AIDS doctor described government financing for prevention programs as ''ridiculous'' and warned that a huge infusion of money was needed to avert an epidemic. Only $800,000 has been allocated in the 2003 federal budget, Vadim Pokrovsky, head of the Center for AIDS Prevention, told the Interfax news agency, enough to treat just 1,000 people. HIV infection in Russia is spreading at one of the fastest rates in the world, with more than 232,000 cases officially registered. Dr. Pokrovsky says the actual figure is closer to one million and threatens Russia's precarious demographic situation, since most AIDS victims will be young people.

The New York Times,A Sicilian Restaurant in Rome,"Trattoria di Roma

ROME | Rome’s reputation for innovative cooking is spotty, and its dalliance with international cuisine is still at a fledgling phase. Finding really good Chinese, or Indian, for instance, or anything-other-than-Italian food, remains the exception rather than the rule.

Now comes what is being touted as Rome’s first Couscous Bar. It’s a novelty served up by the young chef Tiziano Pasquali who recently joined the staff of the restaurant “Trattoria di Roma,” an upscale

eatery in the heart of downtown that’s gambling on novelty, and the appeal of Sicilian cooking with a north African twist.

Besides tuna couscous and vegetable couscous there’s a couscous of the day (on a recent weekday it was shrimp) at 6 euros per serving. You can also order a snack of rice balls (3 euros), eggplant alla parmigiana (6 euros), and other Sicilian treats like panella, flat fried cakes made of chickpea flour (2 euros) or sfincione (Sicilian pizza) for 3 euros.

Lunch is served upstairs, in the elegant and modern dining area (the only drawback: there’s not a lot of light). You can order a la carte, or opt for the tasting menu, which is around 30 to 35 euros per

person. Sicilian desserts – cannoli and cassatine – are also on the menu.

In the evening, in the restaurant foyer, have an “aperitivo,” a pre-dinner snack-and-drink combo that’s typical to many northern Italian cities. Usually, in Rome, you’re lucky if you get a tiny bowl of potato chips when you order a glass of wine in a bar, but prices are affordable at 10 euros for a drink and snack.

Dinner prices average around 65 euros per person excluding wine. If you order caponata, a Sicilian eggplant dish, one euro will be donated to the “Food & Wine for Life” project run by the Catholic organization, Comunità di Sant’Egidio. The money raised is for African children affected by the HIV virus.

The New York Times,Opinion | The Danger of Urban Oil Drilling,"Many Los Angeles residents are familiar with a sight that may seem strange to outsiders: an oil pump operating mere feet from businesses or homes. A recent lawsuit claims that the city has systematically failed to address drilling’s environmental consequences, especially in lower-income neighborhoods that are majority black and Latino.

Los Angeles is currently home to over 1,000 oil wells. The 1970 California Environmental Quality Act requires the city to conduct a preliminary review before approving a new drilling project to determine whether a more extensive review of its environmental impact is necessary. The lawsuit, filed by the advocacy groups Youth for Environmental Justice, the South Central Youth Leadership Coalition and the Center for Biological Diversity, alleges that the city routinely exempts projects from that provision. The plaintiffs found only one case in which the city actually required a full environmental review for oil drilling.

The suit further alleges that the city grants drilling applications in a discriminatory manner — for instance, by allowing dirtier diesel drilling rigs in the majority-black and Latino neighborhoods of South Los Angeles and Wilmington, while requiring quieter and less polluting electric rigs on the city’s wealthier west side. And it says the city has required higher walls around drill sites in majority-white neighborhoods, offering residents there greater protection from dust, sounds and lights.

Pollutants from oil drilling, such as benzene, can cause cancer and other illnesses. Wilmington’s cancer rate is among the highest in Southern California. Residents there and in South Los Angeles have also experienced headaches, nosebleeds, asthma and eye irritation, among other health problems. Some have complained of drilling noise that goes on all night. One drilling site is less than 100 feet from a clinic serving people with HIV. Many wells are very close to playgrounds, homes or schools.",28/11/2015
The New York Times,The Early Word: Speech Prep,"Washington emerges from the Thanksgiving holiday on Monday with health care and Afghanistan on the mind.

The coming weeks will be crucial and strenuous for an already strained White House combating persistent unemployment and falling approval numbers.

“This is a momentous week within a momentous year,” Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, told The Times’s Jeff Zeleny Sunday.

“Throughout the first 10 months of his presidency, Mr. Obama has grown accustomed to sailing through what often appear to be dispiriting times, marked by major obstacles and perceptions that he is flailing,” writes Mr. Zeleny. “But as he heads into December, he faces a convergence of some of the most intense challenges yet, the outcome of which will help set the tone for the midterm elections and the next stage of his presidency.”

Afghan Speech: President Obama will outline his plans to send about 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, including how he intends to pull them out of the country and turn control over to Kabul in an address Tuesday night. The withdrawal will not be tied to the conditions on the ground, nor will it be as strict as the timeline now in place in Iraq.

Lawmakers speaking on the Sunday shows discussed the merits of detailing an exit strategy, with Republicans like Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona warning that doing so would only signal that the United States is not committed to the mission. Several lawmakers also worried about the financial costs assumed by sending more troops. Congress begins hearings the day after Mr. Obama’s speech.

Health Care Roundup: Congress reconvenes at 2 p.m. Monday and so begins Majority Leader Harry Reid’s race to the finish. In the 25 days until the Christmas recess he must at least get a final bill approved by the Senate. Hashing out the differences between the Senate and House versions of the legislation will most likely have to wait until after New Year’s.

Mr. Reid has asked senators to focus on only one priority amendment each to speed budget analysis. “If the challenge for Mr. Reid will be deciding how fast to push, the challenge for his Republican counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, will be figuring out how hard to hit the brakes. Mr. Reid will be accused of rushing; Mr. McConnell of obstructing,” writes The Times’s David Herszenhorn in a preview of the debate and the count to 60 in his Prescriptions column.

Republicans will fight changes to Medicare and new taxes, even after their leaders have said their goal is to kill, not amend, the bill. Within the Democratic ranks issues like immigration and abortion threaten to divide, or even derail, consensus. Meanwhile, the outlook has brightened on the public option.

In a preview of the busy month ahead, The Times’s Carl Hulse outlines how the clock is ticking on a number of other issues, including annual spending, the federal debt limit, the antiterrorism Patriot Act, a highway measure and unemployment aid.



G.O.P. Disarray: The Washington Post continues its examination of turmoil with the Republican Party.

Bo-Tax: The Times’s Jesse McKinley takes a look at the Senate’s proposal to tax all cosmetic surgeries, personal injuries resulting from an accident or trauma, or disfiguring diseases. As Americans become increasingly interested in little nips here and bigger tucks there, critics say the tax places an unfair burden on women and the middle class. The majority of such patients are women and earn less than $90,000 annually.

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs: On top of all this, Congressional Democrats are eager to develop new proposals for tax incentives and construction projects in an effort to promote job creation before next year’s midterm elections. The Times’s Jackie Calmes looks ahead to the White House jobs summit on Thursday and so-called Main Street Tour.

Kennedy Senate Seat: With a little more than a week before the special primary in the race to replace the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the candidates are marshaling their forces. The Boston Globe takes stock of the campaigns, noting there are two televised debates this week as well.

Palin Power: At the New Yorker magazine, Sam Tanenhaus reviews the populist power of former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.

Daily President: Sandwiched between daily briefings and closed-door meetings with advisers, Mr. Obama meets with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia in the Oval Office to discuss a range of issues including Afghanistan and climate change in the run-up to Copenhagen.

HIV/AIDS: A group of administration officials — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius; Ambassador Eric P. Goosby, the United States Global AIDS Coordinator; and Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama’s senior advisers — will highlight Mr. Obama’s HIV/AIDS initiatives in a series of speeches on Monday in advance of World Aids Day on Tuesday.

Congressional Christmas: The legislative branch gets its Christmas tree Monday morning.

War Crimes: A retired American autoworker and accused Nazi began trial in a German court on Monday for his work at a death camp in Poland during World War II.

Crasher Update: The Secret Service spent Friday and Saturday questioning the couple who managed to sneak into last week’s White House state dinner, but has not decided whether to press charges against Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the polo-playing party crashers. The Washington Post reviews possible repercussions for the Secret Service, with a tightening of security expected all around.",30/11/2009
The New York Times,"Appreciating Arthur Russell, Pop Music’s Most Influential Unknown Star","Photo

Though he’s not widely known, Arthur Russell — the avant-garde multi-instrumentalist who bridged classical, dance and experimental music in the 1970s and ’80s before succumbing to AIDS in 1992 — has been one of the most influential forces in popular music. A new compilation, “Master Mix: Red Hot + Arthur Russell” — the latest in the 24-year-old Red Hot + series dedicated to raising money to fight HIV/AIDS — is helping to voice that legacy by putting his compositions in the hands of artists like Robyn, Devendra Banhart and Hot Chip.

Photo

“Arthur’s name kept coming up as an influence — much more than anyone,” explains Paul Heck, who co-produced the Master Mix project (due out Oct. 21) with Dustin Reid. “We felt like he was an underdog, but the response from the artists who wanted to be involved made clear the staying power of Arthur’s legacy.” A classically trained cellist, Russell for a time in the mid-’70s provided the musical direction for the Kitchen, a home to Manhattan’s avant-garde that drew similarly minded iconoclasts like Rhys Chatham, Philip Glass and Glenn Branca. At the same time, he was swept up in the city’s emerging new wave scene, epitomized by Talking Heads, and the dance culture of Studio 54 and Paradise Garage. He recorded music influenced by both sounds (including the seminal club tracks “Go Bang” and “Is It All Over My Face,” recorded pseudonymously under the monikers Dinosaur L and Loose Joints, respectively), as well as a series of idiosyncratic, deeply personal solo recordings, including his 1986 masterpiece “World of Echo” and a number of posthumous releases.

Russell’s catholic blend of experimentation, deep grooves and confessional lyrics, and his unique ability to pull unlikely hooks out of thin air, has clearly had an influence on today’s independent musicians, as “Master Mix” (which takes its title from a trucker hat bearing the logo of a Midwestern farm-animal feed company Russell cherished) makes clear. A particular standout is the opening track, the Swedish artist José González’s take on Russell’s classic “This Is How We Walk on the Moon.” “It was one of those songs that I’d heard but didn’t pay that much attention to before, but once I started listening with the cover in mind it really grew on me,” González says in the liner notes. “I began to hear the potential in the simplicity.”

González’s haunting voice is a perfect fit for Russell’s intimate, muted vocal style. The track finds the singer-songwriter brilliantly merging Russell’s interest in acoustic folk sounds, akimbo horns, personal lament and dance beats, all in one fell swoop. “Arthur’s music transforms from black and white to color, and so does José’s,” Reid says. “He captured the beauty and melancholy of the song in his own way.”",16/09/2014
The New York Times,Security Chief Says Illegal Immigrants Are Tied to Terror,"Top stories from Russian newspapers on Friday.

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA

SECURITY CHIEF LINKS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH TERROR — Combating illegal immigration should be a priority in Russia’s counterterrorism strategy, Nikolai Patrushev, the director of the Federal Security Service, said at a meeting of the National Anti-Terror Commission on Thursday. According to Mr. Patrushev, illegal immigrants in Russia are associated with organized and intensely secretive criminal activity. Mr. Patrushev’s announcement no doubt comes partly in response to the interethnic violence between Russians and migrants from the North Caucasus that broke out in Kondopoga several weeks ago.

POLYGAMY ON THE RISE — A Kyrgyz non-governmental organization focused on women’s issues said the number of polygamous marriages in Kyrgyzstan has grown dramatically in the past two years. The estimated 10,000 women in polygamous marriages, the NGO said, have shed the egalitarian values instilled during the Soviet era, choosing to become the second or third wife of a businessman or politician to escape the dire economic situation in the country.

RUSSIAN WAGES STAGNANT — Russian wages stopped increasing over the summer, according to Russia’s statistics agency. The 2 percent wage growth between July and August matched inflation, bringing the average monthly salary to $408 per month. Since 2001, wage increases have outstripped production output. Growth of this magnitude, the newspaper says, cannot last forever. Experts from the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Center for Labor Research, however, find the statistics dubious.

MASS HIV INFECTION PROVOKES PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSE — Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev fired the minister of health and a regional governor after 55 children contracted the HIV virus from drug transfusions in three hospitals in the city of Chimkent. The blood used in the transfusions was at least 10 years old and had not gone through even the most elemental sanitary processes. There are worries that because H.I.V. testing has been carried out on only half of the 9,000 at-risk children, the number of infected may be twice as high.

Currently the three are charged with ethnically motivated murder, but they may also be charged with carrying out a terrorist act.

The New York Times,If You Don’t Buy This Magazine …,"The estimable Texas Monthly magazine, based in Austin, hasn’t always been kind to the Bush administration – witness the issue at left, which recently won a 2007 American Society of Magazine Editors award for best cover line. (“If You Don’t Buy This Magazine, Dick Cheney Will Shoot You in the Face.”)

Still, when the Bushes have a story to tell, they sometimes reach out to the magazine’s writers. Robert Draper, a former Texas Monthly writer, got a good deal of access to Bush to write his recent book “Dead Certain.”

And in the current issue of the magazine, Skip Hollandsworth – Bush’s nickname for him, dating from the days of his gubernatorial campaign, is “Skipper” – entertainingly profiles Jenna Bush, who has a new book, “Ana’s Story: A Journey of Hope,” about an HIV-positive single mother, in stores.

In Hollandsworth’s telling, Jenna Bush gets off some semi-decent lines. Here’s a sliver of his piece:

Jenna Bush: Oh, by the way, Dad was going to call and say hi, but then the King of Jordan called. Sorry you got bumped. Hollandsworth: What do you think your dad’s doing right now? J.B.: Riding his bike around the White House lawn. He’s a maniac on that bike.



Hollandsworth: And your mom? J.B.: She’s probably in the sitting room on the second floor, reading. We got the new Texas Monthly, by the way. I saw you had an article in there. All I have to say is, I hope you write a better one about me.

A little later in the piece, the President gets on the line and razzes Hollandsworth about his writing, too.

“What?” Bush says to him. “You haven’t written a book yet?”

The whole piece is here.

The New York Times,"Vesta Williams, R&B Singer and Actress, Dies at 53","EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Vesta Williams, a rhythm and blues singer and later an actress who had hits in the 1980s with “Don’t Blow a Good Thing” and “Congratulations,” was found dead on Thursday in a hotel room here. She was 53.

The cause may have been a drug overdose, said Capt. John Kades of the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.

Ms. Williams had hits with “Once Bitten Twice Shy,” “Sweet, Sweet Love” and the torch song “Congratulations,” in which she emotionally bids goodbye to her former lover, who is about to marry someone else, on his wedding day. (“I thought it would have been me/Standin’ here with you.”)

She also appeared in movies and on television. She was a saloon singer in the Mario Van Peebles movie “Posse” in 1993, and she had a recurring role on the television situation comedy “Sister, Sister,” playing the actress Jackee Harry’s best friend, Monica.

Ms. Williams’s initial success in the music industry came as a background singer for Chaka Khan, Anita Baker and Sting, among others. She released her first album, “Vesta,” in 1986.

The New York Times,India’s Supreme Court Recognizes 3rd Gender,"NEW DELHI — In a landmark ruling on Tuesday, the Supreme Court of India allowed transgender people to identify as a third gender and directed the central and state governments to give full legal recognition to them.

The top court was responding to a public interest lawsuit filed by the National Legal Services Authority, which provides free legal services to the poor and disadvantaged. The group had argued that treating transgender people as legal nonentities, unable to apply for official identification documents, meant that they were deprived of basic human rights.

The court agreed with the organization and directed governments to treat the transgender community as a minority group that is eligible for welfare programs, health care and employment and help transgender people to become part of mainstream society.

For centuries, the transgender community has occupied a singular place in Indian culture. In the past, many were eunuchs, called hijras, a Hindi term for belonging to neither gender, who served as sexless watchdogs of Mughal harems. Today, many people who identify as transgender, even the many who are not castrated, are regarded with suspicion and ridicule, and are thought to possess powers of sorcery by some.

Activists who work with the community were overjoyed with the Supreme Court’s ruling.

“I was just talking to my mom about this decision, and I told her, ‘Mom, I’m legal,’ ” said Abhina Aher, 39, who identifies as transgender and works at the nonprofit HIV/AIDS Alliance. “‘You don’t have to be ashamed of me anymore.’”

“I am so happy,” said Anjali Gopalan, founder and executive director of the Naz Foundation, a nonprofit group that has been working in the fields of H.I.V./AIDS awareness and transgender rights.

“It is a progressive judgment, and it has a far-reaching consensus,” Ms. Gopalan added.

Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer who has been fighting cases for the transgender community, called the judgment “extraordinary.”

“It comes after decades of pursuit,” Mr. Gonsalves said. “It is the first step toward recognizing the transgender community as a third sex.”

Mr. Gonsalves added that this judgment was like a “breath of fresh air” after the Supreme Court’s ruling in December that criminalized gay sex in restoring Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which had been been struck down by a lower court.

For some transgender Indians, the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday was not a complete salve for a life on the margins. Shalini Nair, a 29-year-old who lives in Mumbai, said that until two years ago she had to beg on the streets, which she called “collecting.” Now, she makes a living dancing at weddings, where the presence of transgender people is thought to be auspicious.

Though she identifies as transgender, she thinks of herself as a woman, and though encouraged by the possibility of health and education benefits for her community, she was ambivalent about the third gender status.

“It is a sign of separation,” she said. “Transgender people should be free to choose their own sex.”",15/04/2014
The New York Times,Five Finalists Picked in Condom Wrapper Contest,"One way to promote safer sex is to make it more attractive.

The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene announced today the five finalists in its design competition for condom wrappers. The finalists’ designs are displayed above in the slide show. And now the vote is on.

The people will have the final say on which design will wrap around several million Lifestyles lubricated male condoms that will be available at bars, clubs, restaurants, gyms and coffee houses, as well as clinics and community centers throughout the city this fall. Any New York City-based organization, public or private, can also order them at nyc.gov/condoms.

You can cast your vote here, or on Facebook. The polls will be open until 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 28.

“We want to thank all of the creative New Yorkers who participated in the package design contest,” said Dr. Thomas Farley, New York City’s health commissioner. “We still face an epidemic of HIV/AIDS and high rates of other sexually transmitted diseases. When used correctly and consistently, condoms can prevent these infections as well as unintended pregnancies. Involving New Yorkers in this issue is one way we are reminding those who are sexually active to use condoms whenever they have sex.”

A panel of local artists and advertising professionals, as well as public health and social-marketing experts, sifted through nearly 600 entries that were submitted via the Web and snail mail. Among the judges were Kenneth Cole; Cynthia Dantzic, a professor of art at Long Island University; Brian Davis, a senior peer educator of the Child Center of New York’s Teen Impact Prevention Program (TIPP); Christine Murphy, the public sector manager of Ansell Healthcare Products, LLC; Paul Orefice, the managing partner at the creative advertising and design firm the Watsons; and Stephen Stafford, the director of communications at Adolescent AIDS Program at Montefiore

The New York Times,Ice Cube and the Obstacles Facing ‘Compton’,"Let’s do a throwback Tuesday to last week, a few days before the Oscar nominations were announced, unleashing a torrent of fury over the omission of black actors and films about black characters. The prospects for “Straight Outta Compton,” directed by F. Gary Gray, looked bright: many forecast it would receive a best picture nomination (it did not). Ice Cube, a producer on the film, which depicts the rise of his group, N.W.A., met with the Bagger at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. He talked about his son O’Shea Jackson Jr., who plays Cube in the film, the therapeutic value of gangsta rap, and what would be lost if “Compton” did not get a nomination. Here are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Did you ever imagine that “Straight Outta Compton” would be part of this awards conversation?

A. It was our dream and we knew we had great ingredients. We were being real, we were being true to the feeling of the time of what happened. We we were hoping, wishing that we would be right here. Gary's out, I'm out doing things, my son, I got him going everywhere, and Jason Mitchell [who played Eazy-E] is showing up so we're out there you know. As my son would say — “kissin' hands and shakin' babies. We're out here shakin' babies.”

Q. Did you see the subject matter being an obstacle?

A. Big obstacle. We felt like more than just being a black movie, we didn't think that would be an obstacle more than the subject matter of gangsta rap. We thought that would be the turnoff, or not even the turnoff, but never turn on, people would dismiss it. It had all the ingredients. It has brotherhood, it has breakup to makeup, it has rags to riches, it has freedom of speech, police brutality, AIDS and HIV. It was dealing with everything under the sun.",20/01/2016
The New York Times,Hospital Confronts Childbirth Deaths in Mumbai Slum,"Photo

DHARAVI, Maharashtra— Elizabeth Nadumani, 40, pulled up the bottom of her sari as she stepped over a hole filled with milky fluid and floating debris toward the entrance of a shack in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum. Inside the tiny home, a 23-year-old mother named Chaya, who goes by one name, breastfed her one-month-old son. When Ms. Nadumani parted the thin curtain that served as a door, Chaya covered her breasts and straightened her matted hair. In hushed tones, Ms. Nadumani reminded the young mother of her son’s pending appointment for a polio vaccination, and then slipped her a package of government condoms.

“Just a reminder,” Ms. Nadumani said quietly in Marathi, “because Vishnu is your third,” she said of Ms. Chaya’s son.

Ms. Nadumani is a paid volunteer at The Urban Health Centre for Sion Hospital, in central Mumbai, and one of the unsung heroes in India’s battle against maternal and infant mortality. The center where she works is a small building commonly known by residents of Dharavi slum as Chhota Sion. Just a dusty five-minute walk from Sion’s larger government hospital, Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital. The space is easy to miss, scattered among the chai stalls, dumpsters, and repair shops that currently shield Dharavi’s complex web of poverty from the bumper-to-bumper traffic of Mumbai’s Eastern Expressway. But to the new mothers and soon-to-be mothers living in Dharavi who rely on Chhota Sion for free prenatal and early infancy check ups, the building and its staff represent, especially during that fragile period from conception to a baby’s first steps, the very center of their lives.

It is no secret that high maternal and infant mortality rates continue to haunt the vast legions of India’s poor. According to World Bank statistics, 220 mothers died for every 100,000 live births from 2008-12 in India. As a point of comparison, China’s maternal death rate was 37 out of 100,000 live births during the same period, or one-fifth India’s rate. Babies were not much luckier during those years, as India lost 47 out of every 1000 infants, or close to four times worse than China’s rate during that time.

The fight to give birth safely, is among many obstacles facing women in India, where reports of rape and acts of female infanticide continue to dominate headlines. Doctors insist that the problem requires more public attention and there is a dire need to replenish outdated equipment, expand existing work spaces, and hire more qualified staff in poorer communities for making childbirth a safer experience. For evidence, they say, look no further than the slums of Mumbai.

“Mumbai should be seen as a beacon of hope for India in terms of improving the safety of childbirth,” explained Dr. Arun Nayak, 50, an obstetrician and professor at Sion Hospital. “But because of the density of population here, many total lives are still lost, and that means that we still have work to do.”

Dr. Nayak, who heads up a commission on maternal deaths for Sion Hospital, estimates that roughly 15,000 births have occurred in his ward this year, and somewhere between 50 and 60 mothers have died. These estimates would be much closer to the slightly better maternal mortality rates of China than to those of the rest of India. According to the most recent statistics from the Indian government’s Planning Commission, the state of Maharashtra ranked third best among Indian states in maternal and infant mortality rates between 2007 and 2009, behind Tamil Nadu and Kerala, but Dr. Nayak’s estimates would eclipse even those state figures, and by a considerable margin. He attributes this success to the wide range of resources available to patients at Mumbai’s larger government hospitals, where the equipment is modern, resources are plentiful, and medical teams are fairly large.

“We have resources here in Sion, like a large blood bank,” Dr. Nayak said. “But many peripheral government hospitals and rural hospitals quite simply do not.”

According to Dr. Nayak, poorly financed government hospitals located outside the city limits are to blame for the majority of deaths he sees in the obstetrics wing of Sion. Peripheral hospitals, as doctors commonly refer to them, often lack space or sufficient manpower, making it extremely difficult for workers to deal with the potential complications that can arise during childbirth. When a peripheral hospital cannot sufficiently care for a patient, Dr. Nayak explained, the expectant mother is then transported to a larger government hospital like Sion, where her ambulance can sometimes spend hours stuck in traffic along the way. The length of this trip often amounts to a dangerous waiting game.

“Sometimes at a peripheral hospital there is only one person caring for a hundred patients at once,” Dr. Nayak said. “There is only so much these doctors can do to help.”

On a recent afternoon, Dr. Nayak was forced to perform an emergency operation on a woman who had incurred life threatening vaginal injuries while giving birth in a peripheral hospital located in the city of Bhiwandi, nearly 40 kilometers, or 25 miles, from Sion. The woman, who was not named out of respect for her privacy, was treated in a ward filled with 10 other pregnant women. To anyone who has seen a maternity ward of a private hospital, the idea of giving birth in a cramped room with other women might seem extraordinarily uncomfortable. But Sion is among the most spacious government hospitals available to women in Mumbai. And Dr. Nayak believes that space helped to save his patient’s life, and the life of her child.

“We lost four women here this August that were transferred from peripheral hospitals,” Dr. Nayak said. “She became uncomfortably close to becoming the fifth.”

Space is a precious commodity in a city of 18.4 million residents, and more of it cannot be simply willed into existence Chotta Sion was built over two decades ago as Dharavi swelled to become one of the most populated slums on the planet. A more direct means of providing health care to residents was needed to clear room from its larger parent hospital, Lokmanya Tilak General.

One wall in the health station bears signs that detail the sobering statistics of Dharavi slum’s ever-surging populace, setting the stage for that herculean task of caring for all of them:

“Total Population – 87,388, Birth Rate – 13.89%, Death Rate – 5.24%, Infant Mortality – 27.14%, Maternal Mortality – 0.06%.”

Monitoring those 87,388 people is the team working out of Chotta Sion’s primary health post, a rectangular room saturated with fluorescent lights and stacked to the ceiling with boxes of tuberculosis medications. Overseeing this room is Dr. Girish Gaikwad, 29, an energetic post-graduate doctor who, along with immunizing patients and attending to emergency cases, gives direction to the many paid volunteers like Ms. Nadumani, who go door-to-door checking on people in Dharavi during pregnancy and early infancy.

“If someone is pregnant, the volunteers find out and advise the mother on where to go and what to do,” Dr. Gaikwad said. “If the women remain reluctant to seek medical help, they will counsel them on the benefits.”

Ignorance and superstition are major obstacles to overcome in rural villages, where dangerous home deliveries are commonplace. But Dr. Gaikwad estimates that 90 percent of expectant mothers in Dharavi are booked for hospital stays well in advance, a testament to the goodwill and strong communication lines that have been established here between medical staff and the local community. The process of registering patients for delivery begins as soon as one of the door-to-door volunteers learns of a new pregnancy. A file is then prepared for the mother-to-be, charting her progress leading up to and after the moment of childbirth. Along the way, crucial medicines and vitamins are freely distributed to balance out deficiencies in the diets of women who oftentimes cannot afford adequate nutrition in their daily meals.

While another post-graduate will eventually replace Dr. Gaikwad, Ms. Nadumani and her colleagues have been serving their community for two decades now.

“I remember when I first started these shifts, 20 years ago,” Ms. Nadumani said. “I had to warn so many more women about the dangers of passing HIV/AIDS to their babies back then.”

She is satisfied that her efforts in the community are paying off not because of what shows up in statistics, but because of the reduction in HIV-positive patients she now witnesses first hand.

“People listen to me because I live here,” Ms. Nadumani explained. “I’m part of the neighborhood.”

Today, however, Ms. Nadumani’s most important duty is not educating people about a disease like HIV/AIDS, or even advising pregnant women, but helping to control the population itself. After women give birth to a second child, Ms. Nadumani and the other volunteers urge them to try using condoms in the hopes of reducing the birth rate. There are certain stigmas against using condoms, however, and these women can instead opt for temporary or permanent sterilization. The government then compensates those who apply for such measures with checks of 500-1000 rupees ($8-$15). The community here can ill afford any increases to its 13.89% birth rate.

While Chhota Sion has made impressive progress in improving the safety of childbirth in Dharavi, workers fear that they are working against the clock: the birth rate of 13.89%, for example, indicates the percentage rise of new people born into the slum each year, and the death rate, 5.24%, indicates the numbers of human beings taken away from it. In concert, those numbers paint a picture of a population that increased roughly 8.5% percent over the course of the last calendar year, not to mention migration to the area. Should that trend continue apace, Sion could eventually find itself stretched as thin as those peripheral hospitals mentioned by Dr. Nayak, erasing what has become a bright spot in the war against maternal and infant mortality. It is an outcome that everyone who works here is eager to avoid.

The New York Times,Nurse Replaces Surgeon General After Obama Appointee Resigns,"Surgeon General Vivek H.

Admiral Trent-Adams will for now be in an acting role. As of Friday evening, she had already replaced Dr. Murthy on the surgeon general’s Twitter account, and her portrait had replaced his on the agency’s Facebook page. One of the first comments on that post asked, “Where is Dr. Murthy?”

Alleigh Marré, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an emailed statement on Friday that he was asked to step down “after assisting in a smooth transition into the new Trump administration.” Ms. Marré said Dr. Murthy would continue to serve as a member of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service.",21/04/2017
The New York Times,Hillary Clinton Stops Apologizing and Starts to Sprint,"Photo

HIGHLAND HILLS, Ohio — Hillary Clinton began the final sprint to Tuesday’s nominating contests in five states with a visit to church here on Sunday. She had spent the previous few days apologizing for wrongly saying that Nancy Reagan had “started a national conversation” about HIV/AIDS during the administration of her husband, President Ronald Reagan.

At the Mount Zion Fellowship, a predominantly African-American church outside Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton stressed her resilience to congregants on Sunday by sharing a favorite saying of Eleanor Roosevelt.

“A woman is like a tea bag,” Mrs. Clinton said. “You don’t know how strong she is until she gets into hot water.”

The church’s followers represented a key constituency for Mrs. Clinton as she seeks to shore up support among minority voters ahead of Tuesday’s contests, hoping her strength among African-Americans can counter inroads Senator Bernie Sanders has made with young voters and working-class whites.

Clinton aides predict tight races in the Midwestern states where economically struggling voters have gravitated to the populist pitch of Mr. Sanders. But even if she loses in the Rust Belt, they see tremendous upside in Florida and North Carolina, where black, Latino and older voters are expected on Tuesday to give Mrs. Clinton a healthy edge in the race for delegates.

“Even if he won in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,” Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said. “We would still have more delegates on the 15th because of their performance in delegate-rich Florida and North Carolina.”

On Monday, Mrs. Clinton will campaign in Chicago and Springfield, Ill., followed by a get-out-the-vote rally in Charlotte, N.C.

As Mr. Sanders runs ads attacking Mrs. Clinton’s positions on global trade deals that many voters blame for widespread job losses, Mrs. Clinton has emphasized her proposals to bring jobs back to the United States and has criticized Mr. Sanders for not presenting specific plans to do the same.

Speaking to a crowd of about 500 people at M7 Technologies, a factory in Youngstown, Ohio, on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton vowed to end steel dumping by China and other nations, a factor that had hit the economy in the state’s Mahoning Valley area.

“I have always been committed to bringing back manufacturing,” she said. “And I’m the only candidate, on either side, who actually has a plan to do that.”

On Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton stopped in at the 8 Sisters Bakery in Marion, Ohio. “I really want to have a conversation,” she told a dozen potential voters seated at wooden tables near a display of pastries.

“I’m very interested in hearing from each of you about your lives,” Mrs. Clinton said. “What you think is working, your challenges, how the economy is going or not going, what needs to be done to create more opportunities in Marion and around it.”",13/03/2016
The New York Times,Maker of Costly Hepatitis C Drug Sovaldi Strikes Deal on Generics for Poor Countries,"NEW DELHI — The maker of one of the costliest drugs in the world announced on Monday that it had struck deals with seven generic drug makers in India to sell lower-cost versions of the medicine — a $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C treatment — in poorer countries.

Gilead Sciences, which is based in California, also said it would begin selling its own version of the drug in India and other developing countries at a fraction of the price it charges in the United States.

The company intends to provide greater access to the medicine, Sovaldi, for most of the nearly 180 million infected worldwide with hepatitis C who do not live in rich countries. Some 350,000 people die every year of hepatitis C infections, most of them in middle- and low-income nations.

Sovaldi, in only its initial year on the market after gaining approval in the United States in December, is on pace to exceed $10 billion in sales in 2014, becoming one of the world’s best-selling drugs. Its high price has led to intense criticism even in the United States, where officials say it could drain Medicaid budgets and insurers say it could cause increases in private insurance premiums.",16/09/2014
The New York Times,China Drafts Rules on Biotech After Gene-Editing Scandal,"Gene editing for reproductive purposes is effectively banned in the U.S. and most of Europe. In China, ministerial guidelines prohibit research on embryos that ""violates ethical or moral principles."" Ethical guidelines published in 2003 say that gene editing is permitted for research, but that the experimental embryo cannot be nurtured for more than 14 days.

He Jiankui said he edited the babies' genes at conception in hopes of making them resistant to the AIDS virus, as their father is HIV positive. His lab was in Shenzhen, China's southern tech hub, and he recruited study participants through an AIDS advocacy group. He said his goal was to rewrite DNA before birth to make some children immune to HIV during their lifetime.

China immediately halted He's experiments after his announcement.

He also pursued international experts at Stanford and Rice universities, where he had done graduate studies work, and elsewhere, seeking advice before and during the experiment.

In an interview with The Associated Press the month before his project was publicized, the 34-year-old scientist said he believed gene editing of human embryos resulting in live births was legal in China because the country has no law specifically forbidding it.

China's official Xinhua News Agency reported last month that He had breached national guidelines and would be punished for any legal violations. Xinhua didn't say which laws He might have violated, but noted that he had fabricated an ethical review.",26/02/2019

The New York Times,The Early Word: No Surprises,"Neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney are interested in new gun control initiatives after the deadly rampage in Colorado last week, with some members of Congress acknowledging that any such initiative would be used in a fund-raising appeal against them by the National Rifle Association. Both candidates have supported gun control in the past, but their views shifted as Americans have backed away from stricter gun laws, and both men have felt a political sting from their earlier positions, Trip Gabriel reports.

President Obama began a sharp assault on Mitt Romney’s foreign policy credentials Monday in a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, Helene Cooper and Richard A. Oppel Jr. write. With Mr. Romney scheduled to leave Wednesday on a trip to Britain, Israel and Poland, Mr. Obama used his appearance to paint his rival as a national security neophyte with a dangerous affinity for failed policies of the past.

Senate Republicans will press this week to extend tax cuts for affluent families set to expire Jan. 1, but the same Republican tax plan would allow a series of tax cuts for the working poor and middle class to end next year, Jonathan Weisman reports. It sets up a potentially tricky issue for Republicans, who have said they do not want taxes to go up on anyone while the economy struggles to gain altitude, but under their plan, about 13 million families would see tax refunds reduced, and some would see their taxes increase.

The New York Times,"Two Duos Working Without Scripts, Trying to Avoid Improv Clichés","If “Two Men Talking,” which is next performed on June 24 and 25, sounds a bit like theatrical therapy, it is in a way. Mr. Browde is influenced by the narrative therapy movement, which advocates the use of storytelling to address childhood traumas. Additionally, the first raw version of what became “Two Men Talking” was presented at a family therapy conference under the title “Friendship and Community in the Age of HIV.” The experiment was born of a quarrel between the two friends about whether Mr. Browde should make public the details of how he contracted HIV.

“We thought it would be an interesting argument to present at a conference, about who owns a story,” Mr. Browde said. “People liked it, but they wanted more context.”

Photo

The context is that both men had grown up in Johannesburg, where they met as children and attended school together but didn’t become close until they met again many years later in New York. They began to fill in the missing years by compulsively exchanging stories from their pasts. “It was like meeting a kindred spirit,” Mr. Browde said. “That was the impulse for telling stories, to form a bond.”

They started writing the tales down after the conference, but when Dan Milne, a director friend, invited them to develop the project at the Young Vic in London, the first thing he did was throw the script out. If the actors were going to be telling a story again and again, he reasoned, they had to remain alive to the moment.

“The listening aspect is crucial,” Mr. Nossel said. “I cannot take my attention off Paul for a second when he’s telling a story. I’m not sitting there planning which story I’m going to be telling next.”

Mr. Nossel and Mr. Browde at least have their actual experiences to draw from during a show. Mr. Jagodowski and Mr. Pasquesi — who next perform at the Barrow Street July 25 to 27 — have to pull an hour’s worth of story and anywhere from 5 to 12 characters out of thin air. They’re not even assisted by plot suggestions from the audience, something they see as the tired gimmick of many another improv outfit.

“When you take suggestions, a lot of it is to prove to the audience that you’re making it up,” Mr. Pasquesi explained. “But it doesn’t prove it. Also you do it engage the audience into thinking they’re participating in the evening, which I don’t think we need anymore.”

The two were first thrown together at an improv festival in 2001. Mr. Jagodowski was delighted by the accident. “If you’ve ever improvised in Chicago, you know the name David Pasquesi. He’s in the pantheon.” The experience led to a regular Wednesday night gig at the iO Theater (formerly the ImprovOlympic), where their antics have made them a cult attraction.

The two men have spent much of their energy fighting off improv clichés. “Sometimes with improvisers,” Mr. Pasquesi said, “something occurs during the day, and they think, ‘This would make an interesting scene,’ and they bring that to the show. But that kind of works against what we’re doing, which is reacting to this thing that’s only here right now.”

What’s more, they’re convinced their extremely attentive audiences would instantly smell a rat if they tried anything so premeditated. “They will recognize that you came out with an agenda,” Mr. Jagodowski said, “and it feels terrible for everybody.”

Once the shows are over, the four men’s artistic paths again diverge. The two Chicagoans painstakingly weigh the success of their effort. The South Africans never mention the show again. “I don’t even recall it sometimes,” Mr. Browde said. “It feels like a dream.”",15/06/2008
The New York Times,Google Flu Trends: When the Government Knows You’re Sick,"Google has rolled out a new tool, called Google Flu Trends, that it says will provide an early-warning system for flu outbreaks.

The idea is simple: Google will monitor the geographical location of users who search for terms like “flu symptoms.” By keeping track of where flu-related searches are made, it says it will be able to give public health officials a heads-up when flu outbreaks are occurring, and where they are spreading.

There is a clear value to the service. The warnings will allow government officials to put safety measures in place, ideally slowing the disease’s progress. Since tens of thousands of people die of the flu every year, Google Flu Trends could save lives.

There are, however, also reasons for concern. When people search on Google, they think they are doing research, as they would at a library or bookstore. They do not believe that they are making some kind of report to the government.

Google says that Google Flu Trends will protect people’s privacy by providing only aggregate data. That’s true up to a point. If you and your neighbors all do searches for flu-related symptoms, you might be tipping the government off that you are a problem area. That aggregated data could conceivably lead the government to take “control measures,” like a quarantine, aimed at your area.

There is also always the danger that the government could drill down deeper, and find out specific people who are sick. Even though Google Flu Trends will aggregate data, Google collects and holds onto a lot of search data in ways that are personally identifiable — such as by recording the user’s IP address. If the government presented Google with a subpoena requesting data on individual computer users who searched for flu data, it might have to hand over information about specific sick people.

This could, of course, become even more troubling if Google expands this tool to other areas — tracking, who has cancer, or HIV, or — say — which regions do the most searches that are critical of the government.

The upside of Google Flu Trends is clear, and is being widely lauded. Anyone who cares about privacy — and about excessive government monitoring of the citizenry — should be concerned about the possible downside, which needs to be carefully monitored.",12/11/2008
The New York Times,AIDS Funding Bill Sails Through the House,"The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed legislation allocating billions of dollars in federal money for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.

By a vote of 408-9, the House reauthorized the Ryan White Care Act, first enacted in 1990 and named for the Indiana teenager who died of AIDS. The Senate has already passed the bill by unanimous consent, meaning the legislation now heads to the desk of President Obama, whose administration has indicated strong support for it.

The bill, which has a framework similar to the 2006 legislation that last reauthorized Ryan White funds, approves an additional four years of funding for the program, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services to about 500,000 lower-income people each year. It allocates $2.55 billion for fiscal year 2010, with that figure rising to $2.95 billion by the 2013 fiscal year.

The last reauthorization was scheduled to expire on Sept. 30, but was extended for one month.

The measure also mandates that states use a name-based reporting system by the 2013 fiscal year, but allows states to submit code-based data until then at a penalty. And it includes a so-called “hold harmless” provision, which protects communities that see relative drops in the numbers of cases from facing large funding decreases.



The reauthorization was negotiated by lawmakers from both parties in both chambers, making it a stark contrast to not only the rancor enveloping the current debate over health care, but also the acrimony surrounding the last reauthorization.

In 2006, lawmakers from states with large urban areas, like California and New York, quarreled over funding levels with those from more rural states before a compromise plan was approved in December, the month before a new Congress was sworn in.

On Wednesday, Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Joe Barton of Texas — the chairman and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, respectively – both praised the reauthorization.

Mr. Waxman, a Democrat, said that lawmakers from both parties realized that AIDS was not a partisan issue. “We all had to compromise,” Mr. Waxman said. “This doesn’t contain all the provisions I wanted to see, but it’s a good solid bill.”

In a statement, Mr. Barton, a Republican, said he was “proud to be an original co-sponsor of this reauthorization bill, and am glad that we were able to come to agreement on this important legislation.”",21/10/2009
The New York Times,Animals Starve on the Mongolian Steppe,"“A Bitter Spring for Mongolia’s Nomads” (02:33) The wind lashes the camera as the pile of dessicated animal corpses grows. The scene is one of obvious tragedy, in a place both bleak and beautiful. In Mongolia, a terrible summer drought was followed by a brutal winter that wiped out more than 8 million animals on the steppe. The deaths played havoc with a place where food is scarce and where people already suffer from severe poverty. Andrew Jacobs, a Times correspondent, shot a video that captures heart-rending desperation. (E.O.)



“Ocean Calling: Jeff Denholm” (03:00) Working as a deckhand in the Bering Sea 17 years ago, Jeff Denholm lost most of his right arm in an accident. The ocean had always been a big part of his life, and the accident did not change that. In this inspiring video, we learn about Mr. Denholm’s obsession and watch his amazing effort to compete in the 32-mile, Molokai-to-Oahu paddle board competition, in which participants lie on a long board and drive through the water using their arms. “If I get in the right rhythm,” Mr. Denholm says, “I kind of feel like I have two arms.” Does he make it? You’ll have to watch to find out. (E.O.)



“Scrapertown” (07:32) Tyrone Stevenson has seen murders, corpses and death before his eyes. And he is only 21. “Oakland is no joke,” he says. But he has found a glimmer of joy. He’s inspired a group of young followers to “scraperize” their bicycles — painting the frames in vibrant colors, weaving boldly patterned decorations through the wheel spokes. There’s a discipline to his “scraper” bike team: you can get kicked off if you don’t maintain a 3.0 grade point average. And the bike had better be amazing. Produced, directed and shot by Drea Cooper and Zackary Canepari, this video offers a beautiful slice of life and a reminder of how individuals can change things for the good with the little they have.

“The Green Book Materials” (08:48) “I wake up every morning and I haven’t died in my sleep yet,” Rey says. “So obviously, there is something I’ve got to do. There is some reason that I am here.” Hope, solitude, HIV. These three words define Rey, a man struggling with heroin addiction. It’s a simple video about someone trying to do his best. Eliot Rausch directed and edited this portrait; a snapshot of a longer documentary whose release I’m eagerly awaiting. (S.R.)",21/05/2010

Live audio on HIV/AIDS care and services issues, from the 12th National HIV/AIDS Update Conference in San Francisco.",16/03/2000
The New York Times,Expressing Convictions at the Mall,"On the surface, all seems well. But, as the trend has gathered stream, a debate has begun over the political meaning of buycotting: is consumption an exciting new form of citizenship? Or is it a sign of how corroded citizenship has become that shopping is the closest many of us are willing to come to worrying about labor laws, trade agreements, agriculture policy — about good old-fashioned politics?

Political consumption is not new; its history streaks through the civil rights movement, the campaign against apartheid and other causes. What is new is that boycotting is surrendering to buycotting, the sending of positive, not just negative, signals; and that it is practiced increasingly by mainstream shoppers, not just die-hard activists.

Political consumption also perhaps supports a new-age behavioral theory: that humans, long imagined by traditional economists to be rational, utilitarian creatures, in fact have more complex longings, and often are willing to sacrifice economically for an idea or feeling.

A study published this autumn in the Political Science Quarterly found that 62 percent of Americans were willing to pay $5 extra for a $20 sweater produced more ethically, and three-quarters would spend 50 cents more for a pound of fair-trade coffee.

Proponents of buycotting see these premiums as pure political expression: citizens’ parting with money to refine the world. Some argue that cash-voting goes further than ballot-casting: we buy, and thereby incentivize producers, every day; but we vote far less often.

“We are convinced that how people buy can be more effective than how they vote,” said Francesco Galante, a director of Comitato Addiopizzo, a civic group in Palermo, Sicily, that has taken on the mafia using an analogue of fair-trade labeling. In 2004, some volunteers in Palermo decided to bypass politicians: they approached local businesses, many of which paid the mafia “pizzo,” or bribes, and asked them to certify that they no longer paid pizzo; in exchange, the Comitato brought them business from pizzo-averse Sicilians.

Today 400 businesses and 9,000 customers have joined, even though products from law-abiding companies often cost more.

Consumption may be the most effective citizenship, Mr. Galante believes, because companies, more than governments, are horrified at the prospect of alienating customers; whether they operate a sweatshop or build gas guzzlers, they are willing to change when fads turn.

But ethical consumption has begun to attract critics.

One set are free-enterprise champions who argue that politicizing consumption distorts prices and spurs overproduction while imposing arbitrary conditions on producers — such as that developing-world farmers enroll their children in school — that might sound good to Westerners but ignore complex local realities.

Insisting on the noblest production methods conflicts, these critics say, with the very function of markets: to bring the most goods to the most people as cheaply as possible.

Another group of critics doesn’t deny political consumption’s power. Rather, they bemoan that citizenship has come down to this.

Citizenship, for them, is about voting, marching, writing — about being involved. In the modern age, they say, we have begun to turn inward, bowl alone, shirk our public duties. And now comes this cheap (in the moral, if not economic, sense) way to participate just a little, assuage guilt just a little, involve ourselves just a little in AIDS and trade, feel just a little of activism’s thrill.

In an article last year in The Lancet, the British medical journal, the scholars Colleen O’Manique and Ronald Labonte strongly condemned RED, the marketing campaign for iPods and other products whose purchase helps to finance the HIV/Aids battle in Africa.

“Be wary of the 21st century’s new noblesse oblige that replaces the efficiency of tax-funded programs and transfers in improving health equity with a consumption-driven ‘charitainment’ model,” they wrote.

Market citizenship, as critics call it, lets the state off easy, they say. Public goods like health systems should be publicly provided, they say. If organic vegetables are better, then we should all eat them, instead of an elite opting out. And privatizing compassion may tempt the state to neglect problems; then, when a recession slows shopping, AIDS orphans languish waiting for you to buy sunglasses.

It is worth asking which problems demand politics and which the mall.

Child labor in Vietnam and unscrupulous intermediaries in the coffee trade lent themselves to buycotting. What can the market do about Darfur or health care in America?

The question, at bottom, is this: have we, with our ethical cars and condoms and carrots, found a way to make markets humane? Or have we rather found a way to make politics bearable to us by turning it into shopping?",10/10/2009
The New York Times,"C.D.C. Director’s $375,000 Salary Will Be Cut","The government will lower the $375,000 salary of the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, after reports that he was being paid considerably more than previous directors, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed on Monday, though it declined to say what his new pay will be.

Dr. Redfield, who became the C.D.C. director in March, had been given the higher salary under a provision called Title 42. It was created by Congress to allow federal agencies to offer compensation that is competitive with the private sector in order to attract top-notch scientists with expertise that the departments would not otherwise have. News reports of his earnings sparked complaints from Senate Democrats and watchdog groups.

“Dr. Redfield has expressed to Secretary Azar that he does not wish to have his compensation become a distraction for the important work of the C.D.C.,” an H.H.S. spokeswoman, who declined to be named, wrote in an emailed response to questions from The New York Times. “Therefore, consistent with Dr. Redfield’s request to the Secretary, Dr. Redfield’s compensation will be adjusted accordingly.”

Title 42 was not used for Dr. Redfield’s predecessor, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, an obstetrician-gynecologist, who was paid $197,300 a year until she resigned in January, or for her predecessor, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, an infectious disease specialist and the former health commissioner of New York City, whose salary was $219,700.",30/04/2018
The New York Times,Scientists Report a Rare Case of H.I.V. Remission,"For the third time in recent years, a child born with H.I.V. has been found free of the virus for a long period after a high dose of treatment early in life.

The discovery has raised anew the hope that early treatment, in some cases, may allow an infected person’s immune system to defeat the virus. But proof has remained elusive, and there have been more disappointments than triumphs.

The child — a 9-year-old South African girl — has been in remission for over eight years, according to research presented Monday at an International AIDS Society conference in Paris.

The case “strengthens our hope that by treating HIV-infected children for a brief period beginning in infancy, we may be able to spare them the burden of lifelong therapy,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a description of the case released by the institute, which sponsored a clinical trial in which the child was enrolled.",24/07/2017

The New York Times,One Year of Listening to Patients,"One year ago today, seven stroke patients shared their stories of illness and recovery in a unique audio feature posted on the Well blog.

They were the first Patient Voices, a regular series that offers first person accounts of the challenges patients face as they cope with various health issues. Since the original Patient Voices appeared, New York Times producer Karen Barrow has continued to give a voice to a wide range of patient stories, ranging from bipolar disorder and psoriasis to restless legs syndrome and spinal cord injury.

We heard from Jacqueline Castine of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., who was diagnosed at the age of 57 with bipolar disorder, and whose son also suffered from mental illness and killed himself. “I could not save him,” she said. “I could not fix him. He leaves a beautiful daughter and a very sad mother.”

And there is runner Alyssa Johnson, 43, who was training for the Boston Marathon in 2003 when she began showing the first signs of Parkinson’s disease. “Occasionally when I’m running I’ll come to a long downhill, and my legs work the way they used to work and my arm swings the way it used to. It’s like running before Parkinson’s, and that’s the best feeling.”

And then there’s the voice of Robin Grinsted, 50, of Swansea, S.C., who contracted H.I.V. from her husband and now feels isolated and ostracized from her church. “They’re not accepting,” she said. “The phrase comes to my mind, ‘What would Jesus do?’ I know what he would do. He would put his arms around me.”

To hear more from these patients and the many others who have taken part in the series, explore the links below to all the Patient Voices we’ve heard from in the past 12 months.

The New York Times,A Site for Data Scientists to Prove Their Skills and Make Money,"Airlines, insurance companies, hospitals and many other organizations are trying to figure out how to corral all their data and turn it into something useful.

Kaggle, a start-up, has figured out a way to connect these companies with the mathematicians and scientists who crunch numbers for a living or a hobby. On Thursday, it announced it had raised $11 million from investors including Khosla Ventures, Index Ventures and Hal Varian, Google‘s chief economist.

“We’re really making big data into a sport,” said Anthony Goldbloom, Kaggle’s founder.

Numbers crunchers on Kaggle have bested years of academic research by predicting how long people with HIV would live, outperformed commonly used algorithms for mapping dark matter and discovered that people who order vegetarian meals from airlines are more likely to show up for the flight.

Here’s how it works. An organization runs a competition by proposing a riddle it needs answered and offering years of data. Anyone can enter to crunch the data and answer the riddle to win a cash prize.

Currently, a health plan is offering $3 million to someone who can take years of patients’ medical claim data and produce an equation to predict whether patients will be hospitalized in the next year, so doctors can try to intervene beforehand. It has almost 8,000 entries so far. A bank is offering $5,000 to someone who can use credit score data to come up with a better way to predict whether someone who receives a loan will enter financial distress in the next two years.

The 17,000 people who have registered to answer questions include professors, a glaciologist and an English major. About half are computer scientists but the best performers are physicists, Mr. Goldbloom said. They do it because “data science is an area where it’s really difficult to prove your own skills and get access to interesting data sets,” said Jeremy Howard, Kaggle’s chief data scientist.

They know about life as data scientists. Mr. Goldbloom studied econometric modeling and worked for the Australian government before starting Kaggle last year. Mr. Howard was a consultant and entrepreneur who caught Mr. Goldbloom’s eye because he kept winning competitions on Kaggle.

Kaggle charges the organizations that host competitions a fee and eventually hopes to take a cut of the prize money. It will also host private competitions for organizations that don’t want to publicly post their data sets online, Kaggle said Thursday. They choose the most elite number crunchers on Kaggle and ask them to sign non-disclosure agreements to compete.

In private competitions, every entrant gets paid. The idea is to someday make it possible for data scientists to earn a living income on Kaggle, Mr. Goldbloom said.

“The incomes of data scientists begin to look more like tennis or golf players or hedge fund managers, rather than sitting in the bowels of Allstate‘s actuarial team,” he said.",03/11/2011

The New York Times,"PATENTS; A human gene is patented as a potential tool against AIDS, but ethical questions remain.","That may be why William Haseltine, chairman and chief executive officer of Human Genome, goes to great lengths to establish the pedigree of his company's latest patent. He describes the extensive hypotheses, experiments and research that started in 1994. ''There's a lot of concern going on for some time about gene patents, what they mean and who gets them,'' Dr. Haseltine said. ''This patent is based on the discovery of a new gene through sequencing that confirmed the proposed utilities and gives basis for the claims.''

Gene patents are categorized as chemical patents (as opposed to general and mechanical, or electrical, the other two categories established at the Patent and Trademark Office) and the government has clear rules about what kind of genetic discoveries can win a patent. But that doesn't mean the debate over gene patenting is settled.

Religious leaders, medical ethicists and scientists have argued that the human genome belongs in the public domain and not in the portfolios of private companies. Opponents of gene patenting worry that commercial considerations might hamper medical or scientific discovery, and there's alarm at the idea that one or two companies could hold enough patents to make them the gatekeepers of the biopharmaceutical industry.

In fact, the original head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health resigned in the early 1990's to protest the issuing of patents for genes. Since then, coordinators of the project have stepped up their research and are actively placing thousands of genes that have been discovered into the public domain. The government's stated goal is to make the sequence of human genes available for the common good.

Thousands of gene patent applications are still pending. Only a fraction have been issued, and none of those have been tested or defended in court, but Human Genome continues to amass patents. The company now owns 112, one of the largest portfolios in the genomics industry.

Dr. Haseltine says that ''we do not use our patents to prevent anyone in academics or the nonprofit world from using these materials for whatever they want, so long as it is not commercial.'' Nevertheless, the company has licensing agreements with American, Japanese, French and German drug companies that allows some of the world's major pharmaceutical giants access to its arsenal of patents.

Since research is a commodity to biotechnology and drug companies, many discoveries that might be crucial to the treatment of disease are patented to protect investment.

And yet, because of the overwhelming public interest in AIDS research, the Patent and Trademark Office was pressured into establishing a separate database for AIDS-related inventions in 1994, to give other scientists access to the cutting-edge research in patents.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

At that time, searching through patent archives was a specialized, time-consuming task. But now that the agency has put much of its patent database on the Internet, anyone can track down AIDS-related patents.

The work of two scientists at Human Genome, Li Yi and Steven Ruben, now joins that group. Their patent covers a gene known as the CCR5 receptor gene. Receptors are found on the surface of cells, much like pins sticking out of a pin cushion, and act as a sort of docking port, sometimes for lethal viruses. But the receptor and the virus have to match, like a key and a lock. CCR5 is known to fit the AIDS virus. The virus binds to the receptor, then fuses to the cell, and fusion allows HIV to work its way inside.

''We are looking for substances that use the cell lines and methods described in the patent to find new anti-HIV drugs that work by binding to CCR5 receptors and blocking them,'' said Dr. Haseltine, who did pioneering work in sequencing the genome of HIV at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ''Think of it as a blanket over the receptor. The virus must recognize special structures on the surface of the cell. If it can't see them, it can't get to them.''

The CCR5 receptor is important because in 1996, researchers at the National Institutes of Health discovered that the small number of people who are missing that gene appear immune to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.

The defect is ''present in about 5 percent of the population originating from Northern Europe,'' Dr. Haseltine explained. ''There's speculation that a previous viral epidemic was highly lethal and those who survived had this natural variation that caused the defect in the CCR5. It's not widely distributed in Asian or African populations.''

Dr. Haseltine hopes the patent could be used for research that will create drugs to treat, cure and even prevent AIDS in the first place. The latter might mean finding a therapy that healthy people could adopt to block transmission of the virus.

''We might get long, slow-acting-release forms of drugs, or genetically engineered genes to create inhibitors,'' Dr. Haseltine said. ''You could protect people from this virus, same as a vaccine.''

The New York Times,"In Africa, Cultural Obstacles to Safe Sex Drive HIV Infections","But the counselors here — all of whom were infected — blamed no one but themselves and their neighbors.

They were all educated, fluent in English — former teachers, a former army officer, a hospital bookkeeper. But Bwindi, like much of Uganda, is made up mostly of subsistence farmers.

“Many people are just ignorant,” said Gervis Muhumuza, 44. “They have low education, and so many misconceptions. Minus the elite class in Kampala and a few others, nobody is using condoms.”

The 2006 Demographic and Health Survey of 11,000 Ugandans found that 99 percent had heard of AIDS, but only about a third had “comprehensive knowledge” — that is, they could correctly say whether it was spread by mosquitoes, by food or by witchcraft; whether it could be prevented by condoms; and whether a healthy-looking person could have it.

Safe-sex messages have not stopped. If anything, they are harder-hitting.

A recent one features the leering face of a creepy middle-age man. “You wouldn’t let him sleep with your teenage daughter,” it says. “Why are you sleeping with his?” Another shows a frightened child saying, “My mommy is sick because of the sexual network.”

Many Africans, researchers say, are in one or more relationships that may include sex only infrequently but last for years. Some are open, as in polygamy; many are clandestine, as with old lovers, bosses or even, perhaps, an abusive uncle who cannot be shaken off.

In such networks, infections spread rapidly. Also, men here, like many men everywhere, complain about condoms.

The arrival of AIDS drugs let some go back to old habits.

“When you are sick, you are tired, you are impotent,” said George Bitti, 58. “But when you are on the drugs for a certain period, you become strong, you regain your body. And you start going again for sex.”

But even before drugs arrived, powerful societal forces were arrayed against safe sex.

“According to African culture, the man is the overlord,” said Peace Atwongyeire, 42, a handsome counselor whose face adorns local billboards saying she is not ashamed to be H.I.V.-positive. “You have to say yes.”

Because a man buys a wife from her father for cows or cash, he “owns” her. If she refuses sex or insists on a condom, he may beat her or throw her out of the house.

Also, condoms thwart pregnancy, and “I prove my manhood by having children,” said Mr. Bitti, a father of 14. “That is how a girl proves she is a woman. In Africa, you cannot tell anyone to stop having children. They will even think, ‘I would rather have AIDS and leave my children when I die. At least I will have produced my three.’ ”

Prostitutes, too, have disincentives. They typically get $5 for sex, but $10 to $20 more for sex without a condom. (Though it did not come up in Bwindi, prostitutes elsewhere in Africa have complained that some clients secretly bite holes in condoms because they believe flesh must make contact for the sex to be real.)

Labor patterns also contribute. Men disdain cooking and laundry as women’s work, so when they work far from home, as many do here, they often pay a local woman to do both, and sleep with her. Meanwhile, a counselor said, “the wife will find a man to buy salt and soap and roof her house.”

Also, much sex is what social scientists call “transactional.” Young women from all but the wealthiest families are under constant pressure to trade sex for high school tuition, for grades, for food for their siblings, even for bus fare.

“If a woman says to me, ‘Please give me 2,000 shillings to get to the pharmacy,’ ” said Topher Kamara, 46, the counselor who is a former officer, naming an amount equal to one dollar, “I will say to her: ‘You want 2,000? Lie down and surrender your goods.’ ”

Ms. Atwongyeire described a poor girl who “found a sugar daddy” because she needed sanitary pads so her classmates would not tease her.

The once-widespread rumor that sex with a virgin cures AIDS has faded (as has a local rumor that sex with a pygmy is a cure). But men still pay teenage girls because they fear “reinfection,” and, Mr. Kamara said, “because older women will make us push them to orgasm, but a young girl will let him satisfy himself and leave.”

Sex education hardly exists. By law, counselors may discuss condoms in high schools but not demonstrate or distribute them.

As a result, rumors abound. For example, they said, many young girls believe condoms can “get lost inside,” causing infections. A government campaign promoting Pap smears backfired when people decided condoms must cause cervical cancer.

Strangest of all, Mr. Kamara said, the mix of disbelief and fatalism is so powerful that he and female counselors have been propositioned after giving AIDS-awareness talks in churches, at which they make a point of announcing that they are infected.

“People say: ‘Oh, I don’t worry. Sleep with me and we will all have H.I.V. together.’ ”",10/05/2010
The New York Times,Connecticut High School Cancels Student Production of ‘Rent’,"Photo

The principal of Trumbull High School in Trumbull, Conn., has become the latest administrator to cancel a drama club production of the musical “Rent,” which deals frankly with sexuality, drug use, HIV and love in the lives of straight and gay characters.

The school’s Thespian Society had been planning a springtime production of the school edition of “Rent,” a profanity-trimmed version of the Tony Award-winning show. The group’s president, Larissa Mark, said on Wednesday that the principal, Marc Guarino, told her and others in late November that he was barring the production because of concerns about “sensitive” material in the show. She said administrators had never weighed in on shows before, but added that Mr. Guarino had only started at Trumbull this summer. To rally support, Ms. Mark created a “Trumbull for Rent” page on Facebook, and she and others circulated a petition in support of the production. Roughly 1,500 fellow students signed, she said, or about two-thirds of the high school’s student body.

Mr. Guarino did not reply to phone and email messages on Wednesday.

On Tuesday night, at a Trumbull Board of Education meeting, Ms. Mark and others argued that “Rent” reflected society today and that gay issues had become mainstream, noting the legalization of same-sex marriage in Connecticut in 2008. A letter from Mr. Guarino was read — he did not attend — in which he affirmed his decision and said that proper planning was needed for a production of “Rent” to lead to educational and thoughtful conversations about issues raised in the show. The board itself took no action, which Ms. Mark and others interpreted as a sign of support for the principal.

“Mr. Guarino has told me that he’d like to do ‘Rent’ at some point, but needs more of a plan,” said Ms. Mark, a senior who has been a stage manager and director on past productions. “Personally I think it’s a good idea to have experts and others come in to talk about these issues, because, while I may not consider them sensitive, some in the community might. But I don’t believe we need over a year to plan this. I do understand where Mr. Guarino is coming from, though.”

“Rent” was chosen by two teachers at the school who are involved with the drama club, and Ms. Mark said that students had been excited to perform it. Recent spring musicals there have been more traditional fare like “Crazy for You,” “The Wiz,” “Fiddler on the Roof,” and “The Music Man.” The Trumbull schools superintendent and the Board of Education chairwoman did not return phone and email messages seeking comment on Wednesday.

“Rent,” as well as plays like “The Laramie Project” that deal with gay themes, have occasionally been canceled by school administrators because of concerns about content, while many other high schools have produced the school version of “Rent.” In 2011, the Board of Education in Waterbury, Conn., approved a school production of the August Wilson play “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone” after the superintendent had pushed for cancellation because of its use of the word “nigger” at several points.",04/12/2013

Submit Your Own City Room wants to see your condom wrapper designs. E-Mail Us »

If you have ever wanted to put your personal imprint on that most personal of items, here is your chance, thanks to New York City. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which unveiled the city’s highly popular first official condom on Valentine’s Day 2007 and followed it up with a redesign a year later, invited New Yorkers to submit designs for a “special, limited-edition” New York City condom wrapper that will be unveiled in the fall.

The design competition — the deadline is Jan. 22 — is just the latest incarnation in the city’s long history of making the prophylactic widely available. The health department started distributing condoms at its clinics in 1971, and expanded the program to community-based health organizations during the 1980s — a time when the city faced fierce criticism by advocates who said its response to the AIDS epidemic was too slow.

In 1998, the city expanded the program to include free female condoms. And in 2005, the department began an Internet-based bulk ordering system, which resulted in a sevenfold expansion of the program, which now distributes 41 million condoms a year in a collaboration with more than 2,000 organizations. (The city uses the lubricated Lifestyles male condom.)

But the idea of making the 2.3-inch square condom wrapper distinctive — initially, the letters “NYC CONDOM” were in the style of subway-line logos, until the 2008 overhaul led by the designer Yves Béhar — is what’s new.

“The NYC Condom has helped New Yorkers talk about and practice safer sex,” said Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the health commissioner.

The design contest is open to any New York City resident 17 and older. (Applicants who are 17 must obtain and submit written consent from a parent or guardian.) A panel of artists, advertising professionals, health experts and social-marketing experts will announce the finalists in February, and residents will choose the winner through an online vote. “Besides appearing on several hundred thousand condom wrappers, the winning design may be featured in future condom promotions,” the health department said.

The artwork must be original, and it cannot include images that are copyrighted, trademarked or sexually explicit. Design proposals can be submitted online (at nyc.gov/condoms) or, in print, to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, Attention: Director of Condoms and Materials Distribution, 40 Worth Street, CN-A/2, Room 1602, New York, N.Y. 10013.

The New York Times,"The Nifty 50 | Gabourey Sidibe, Actress","Patrick Swirc/Corbis

This month, T celebrates the Nifty 50: America’s up-and-coming talent.

Related See more of the Nifty 50

Get it straight: Gabourey Sidibe is not Precious. This is difficult for some of Sidibe’s fans to grasp. “Most people understand the point of the film — it deals with abuse, and neglect, and self-esteem,” she said in a recent phone interview. “They just don’t get that I’m a real person. And I tell them, ‘This is not my story. That didn’t happen to me.'”

“That” is the plot of Lee Daniels’s shocking film, “Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire.” Sidibe (pronounced SIH-deh-bay) plays an obese, illiterate teenager from Harlem who is raped by her father (resulting in two pregnancies and HIV infection), and sexually and physically abused by her heinous mother, played memorably by the comedian Mo’Nique. Daniels considered as many as 500 girls for the part of Precious, but not one of them was perfect. “I couldn’t call Hollywood and say, ‘Send over all your 300-pound black girls,’” Daniels said last year. “They’d laugh.”

The remarkable story of how Sidibe, now 26, was transformed from a well-liked New York college student into a famous actress who’s likely to be nominated for an Academy Award is by now well known. What is less known is that Sidibe’s post-“Precious” acting career is thriving, and early indications suggest that she might be able to shake off the inevitable typecasting that occurs when an unknown takes on such a singular and controversial role. She plays a high-school bully in a coming indie flick “Yelling at the Sky,” which stars another member of our Nifty 50, Zoe Kazan. And she’ll also appear in the pilot episode of Showtime’s “The C-Word,” a dark comedy directed by Bill Condon about a teacher with cancer (Laura Linney).

Amid the whirlwind of press, award nods and offers of new parts, the holiday season provided Sidibe with a novel respite: a chance to get back to her old self. “I have to travel so much that I stayed home in New York,” she said. “I went out with friends. I had random dinners at random times of night. I went to go see Mariah Carey and Trey Songz on New Year’s Eve. I went Christmas shopping for my littles, as I call them — I have younger sisters and a younger brother — and I stayed home, ordered pizza and watched movies,” she said. “It was the best vacation ever.”",07/01/2010
The New York Times,Showcase: Infernal Landscapes,"Any effort to describe the photography of Lu Guang by reference to the work of other artists would almost certainly invoke the name of W. Eugene Smith. (It is, for instance, just about impossible to look at Slide 4 without thinking of “Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath.”)

So it seems especially fitting that Mr. Lu, a Chinese freelancer, is the recipient of this year’s $30,000 W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography for his project, “Pollution in China.” The announcement was made Wednesday evening in New York by the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund on the occasion of its 30th anniversary.

It is not just Mr. Smith’s work that comes to mind when looking at Mr. Lu’s depiction of the dark social and environmental consequences of China’s modern industrial revolution. There is a bit of Charles Sheeler and Edward Burtynsky. And Hieronymus Bosch.

“Because China’s economy is moving so fast, the pollution is incredibly severe,” he told us Wednesday through a translation by Orville Schell at the Asia Society. “As I became aware of the pollution as China opened up the western area, I felt that people needed to know about this.”

Mr. Lu was born in 1961 in Zhejiang Province and was taking pictures before his 20th birthday, when he worked in a factory. He studied at the fine arts academy at Tsinghua University in Beijing from 1993 to 1995 and has concentrated on social and economic issues in his work since then. In 2003, his pictures of peasants in Henan Province who had been infected with HIV after selling their blood won the first prize for a story about contemporary issues from World Press Photo.

In the words of the Smith fund, its annual grants are intended to reward photographers “who have demonstrated a deep commitment to documenting the human condition in the formidable tradition of compassionate dedication that W. Eugene Smith exhibited.”

The jurors were Helen Marcus, president emerita of the fund; Devika Daulet-Singh, founder and director of the Photo-Ink gallery in New Delhi; and Jeff L. Rosenheim, curator of the department of photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They also awarded a $5,000 fellowship to Krisanne Johnson of Brooklyn and announced three other finalists from among 216 proposals: Matt Eich, of Norfolk, Va.; Johan Spanner, from Copenhagen; and Joseph Sywenkyj of Campton, N.H.

“The impact on me is very significant,” Mr. Lu said. “It confirms this work. The money will also allow me to do even better. Certainly, I’m not finished. There are many other places I have to shoot.”",14/10/2009

The New York Times,"Performa 07: Adam Pendleton, Artists and Statistics","My first Performa outing, to Adam Pendleton’s “The Revival,” on Thursday night, was a pretty impressive experience. The setting was the cavernous, immaculate space of the Stephan Weiss studio in Greenwich Village (what did the sculptor do with all that space?), outfitted with benches in a slight fan shape around the stage – and it was packed with fashionable Performa people, some standing near the back. The back was where Mr. Pendleton emerged from, but first his disembodied golden voice floated over the crowd, and over the choir and musicians on the stage. With a mixture of oratory, poetry, politico-speak and strident gay protest, he held sway for just on an hour, alternating his resonant, often repetitive text with the choir’s gorgeous sonorities.

I had my reservations about the text – for one, the section where Mr. Pendleton quotes Aids statistics and talks about the Bush Administration’s responses to HIV infection felt like an obligatory gay rights insert rather than integral to the piece. But the man is the most charismatic performer I’ve seen on stage for a long time – and the acoustics at the studio were extraordinary – for once, the meaning of “crystal clear” seemed appropriate: you could hear everything from a whisper to the full-throated roar of the choir with utter purity.

It was also an extraordinarily polished and well-paced show, from the grave processional entrance of the choir to their departure and Mr. Pendleton’s final monologue and slow exit – out back, the way he had come in. But despite that, there was a relaxed enjoyment of performance and involvement amongst the choir that was a pleasure to see. And their singing really did communicate the uplifting joyousness of that religious tradition without quite speaking directly of religion.

But quite aside from the piece itself, what struck me strongly was that it was the second time in one week that a performer was up there on stage quoting statistics about life in America to an audience. In his wonderful new work, “Misuse Liable to Prosecution,” the choreographer John Jasperse offers the audience numbers about the war, the arts, the salaries of various figures, and the costs of his production. Adam Pendleton does something similar in his Aids section. Are artists feeling that things are so bad that their art forms – poetry, the dancing body in these cases – are too inchoate for what they need to say? Perhaps it was a coincidence, but I suspect not.",04/11/2007

The New York Times,An Insiders' Portrait of Joseph Kony,"Pool photo by Stuart Price

Among the men at large in the world who have been credibly accused of war crimes, Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, occupies an almost otherworldly place. The document that is the subject of Friday’s post, “LRA Religious Beliefs,” shows many of the reasons why.

Mr. Kony, who has been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2005, has engaged since the late 1980s in the mass abductions of children from villages and government-run camps in the Ugandan countryside. His hostages, seized in ambushes along roads and in raids on settlements, became the living fuel for a grim, millennial war.

Document Reader A detailed look into L.R.A. religious beliefs. Go to the Document »

Mr. Kony did not ransom his captives. He had another design. He indoctrinated the boys as foot soldiers in a guerrilla campaign against the Ugandan government and, when directed by his sponsors in Sudan, against villages and rebel groups in Southern Sudan. Abducted girls were put to work, too — as labor, as soldiers, and, once they reached puberty, as sexual chattel for Mr. Kony and his coterie of commanders, who called them their wives.

The document presented Friday is a stitched together file of 12 images I made while doing book research on vacation in Uganda in 2007. Its journey into my possession was nothing but chance. One day, as I was interviewing repatriated child soldiers from Mr. Kony’s brigades, a former senior member of the L.R.A. showed up for an interview holding a wad of soiled, crumbled papers. The papers contained a brief but lush insiders’ view of one of the world’s most elusive — and bizarre — wanted men.

It is difficult to overstate Mr. Kony’s exaggerated style of public weirdness and calculated ferocity. The offshoot of a failed rebel movement led by Alice Lakwena, who said she was possessed by a troupe of spirits who urged her to war, Mr. Kony has presented himself over the years as the channel through which these lingering voices communicate from the beyond.

His guerrilla dossier smacks of a peculiar brand of bush opportunism. Ms. Lakwena, after her forces were routed in the 1980s, said the spirits had abandoned her, and she fled to Kenya, where she passed her final years in a rambling, alcoholic daze. Mr. Kony promptly took her place, insisting he was the spirits’ new vehicle.

How exactly did these possessions manifest themselves? The document the source brought to the interview sketched the dozen or more different spirits that were parts of Mr. Kony’s performances. Some of the descriptions of these spirits’ visits are extraordinary. His ghosts had many names: Juma Oris, Who Are You, Malia Mackay, the list runs on.

We’ll leave it to you to decide whether Mr. Kony truly believes he was possessed, or simply acted out each character for his own purposes. Let’s turn to the document, in which members of his inner circle claimed the L.R.A.’S Leader:

…started having possession episodes in 1987. In the beginning he was possessed sometimes two or three times a day. Over time frequency of possession declined. Prophesized by Juma Oris in Kony in 1995 that there will come a time that the spirit would no longer visit. Kony would always be alerted by “Who Are You” that a spirit would come at a certain time to speak for a certain time (for example at 1400 hours for three or four minutes). Kony’s secretary (Chief to Lakwena) would make the preparations, and Kony would dress in a white robe. A glass of water, a bible, and a rosary were placed on a table. To start the possession Kony would dip his fingers into a clear glass of water. Multiple spirits would pass through Kony in a single session. On average at least three spirits would talk in a session. Junior spirits always talked first. After the session the LRA Army Commander would address the crowd. No one corrected what the spirits said, nor did people dare question the spirits. When Kony dipped his finger in glass of water he slumped forward for a few seconds, then sat up. Each spirit had a separate personality. His voice changed to a woman’s tone of voice when possessed by Malia. Some spirits spoke faster than others. Who Are You was rude – quarreling – and he complained a lot. Chairman Juma Oris talked slow and calm with a flat tone like an “important person.” Malia gave morale and hope after operations, and would say that those injured would recover with help from Dr. Salan. Go to Document »

With this ephemeral but bossy gang, Mr. Kony delineated rules for his army’s behavior, a sort of L.R.A. code of conduct that mixed derivatives of Christianity, Islam, animism and what would seem a free association on guerrilla tactics, social justice, diet, marriage and capital punishment. The author of the document wrote down many of these practices and rules, which Mr. Kony said would help lead Uganda on a path to purification:

On eating meat: “The LRA do not eat pigs,” one rule stated. “However, they will eat warthogs.” Go to Document »

As for fish: “Mudfish (barbells of catfish) are not eaten because they are lazy and if you eat them you will become lazy as well.” Go to Document »

Another passage discussed the lives of L.R.A. “wives:”

Mature abducted women could be made wives almost immediately. Kony would be informed of the abduction and would give direction for some to be brought to him and others distributed among the group that captured them. The most beautiful women went to Kony. He would screen the women for sometimes up to six months, and if he found a detestable trait in her he would refuse to have her as a wife. They would be given to the Operation Room which would determine who she would go to. Go to Document »

And a different section described the fates of “widows:”

When a man dies the woman stays alone for 90 days to grieve, after which she is washed, all her hair shaved and taken to the yard. A controller or technician then prays on her so that she will not lose another husband. (The spirit of the deceased husband lingers around and the prayers remove the spirit of the husband . Otherwise the deceased spirit will kill anyone sleeping with that woman. Violation of this rule has resulted in the majority of LRA deaths.) After this ceremony she can be given to another LRA soldier as a wife. Go to Document »

Yet another detailed Mr. Kony’s supposed healing powers, in this case applied as freshly kidnapped victims were brought into the ranks.

Newly abducted people were taken to the yard. The controllers would pray for them, sprinkle water on them mixed with shea butter oil, and also “camouflaged” them with signs of the cross all over the body using a white powder crushed from “rotten rocks” and mixed with shea oil. The new recruits could not wash for three days, after which the spirit of the Lord descended upon them. This would protect them in battle. If a person was HIV positive the crosses would fall off of his or her body in a day or less. HIV infected persons had to go to the river and wash themselves in a stream or river three times. Kony personally prayed for the person and sometimes poured water over them. When the person left the water they were instructed not to look back and they left the area cured of HIV. Go to Document »

So what is this record? The papers summarized a series of intensive interviews conducted in late 2005 by an American defense attaché in Uganda with former members of the L.R.A. As a courtesy, the attaché, Lt. Col. Richard W. Skow, provided to two of the interviewees an unclassified summary of some of his work. One of these men allowed me to photograph the pages, albeit quickly, before he stuffed them away.

The images sat on a hard drive for two years, until I referred to them again when writing a book, in which they played a role in one chapter. Upon rereading the pages and sharing them with the editor of this blog, we agreed that Colonel Skow’s pamphlet had a larger value, and should be shared as another resource for those interested in understanding the L.R.A.

This week I tracked down Colonel Skow, now retired from the Army and working as the director of the Segera Mission in Kenya, which his father-in-law founded in 2002. Reached by e-mail and on Facebook, Colonel Skow shared recollections.

The document, he wrote from Kenya, “came straight from L.R.A. upper echelon guys that I interviewed normally around 3 hours a day for a couple of weeks.”

“I wrote those pages as a reminder to the community I worked for about what was going on, and in the hopes it would shed more light on the crimes,” Colonel Skow wrote. “I’ll never forget the children I debriefed and what they went through, or the day I brought a child back to his family (permission from the Ugandan Army) and the reactions they all had.”

Colonel Skow’s work provides a layered insight into Mr. Kony and his movement, which to many people are known more by deeds than by close-up views. The rougher sketch is widely known: The L.R.A., according to the International Criminal Court, “has engaged in a cycle of violence and established a pattern of ‘brutalization of civilians’ by acts including murder, abduction, sexual enslavement, mutilation, as well as mass burning of houses and camp settlements.” This internal sketch shows how the movement can feel to its members.

For the last few years, Mr. Kony and his guerrillas have operated from bases in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. He has remained at large in the face of calls for his arrest. Acholiland, the area of Uganda where he fought for years, remains economically depressed. Villages lie in ruin, much of the population lives in camps, and the sight of victims of his squads’ chilling tactics — including people with their noses and lips sliced away — can imbue Acholiland with a haunted feel.

Colonel Skow’s portrait is in itself an unstated indictment. With its straight-forward account of the Kony spirit show and its passing descriptions of L.R.A. practices, it’s something simple and useful: an unusual glimpse a long-lasting guerrilla leader accused of war crimes.

Colonel Skow provided me an original Word document of this report, confirming that the record my source brought to the interview was complete and unedited. Five years after he compiled it, Colonel Skow was happy to share for readers of this blog.

The New York Times,Top Prescription Plan to Offer $1 Alternative to $750 Pill,"Turing Pharmaceuticals’ effort to charge $750 a pill for a 62-year-old drug is facing a new headwind: The nation’s largest prescription drug manager plans to back an alternative that costs only $1 per pill.

The prescription drug manager, Express Scripts, was expected to announce on Tuesday that it will promote use of a compounded medicine that contains the same active ingredient as the Turing drug, Daraprim.

“This could become a solution for the vast majority of patients,” Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts, said in an interview.

The compounded medicine is already being made and sold by Imprimis Pharmaceuticals in San Diego. But the move by Express Scripts, which manages prescriptions for tens of millions of Americans, could increase sales considerably.",01/12/2015
The New York Times,This Week’s Health Industry News,"While Congress and the Obama administration averted a government shutdown late last week, federal lawmakers and presidential aides will continue to debate how to cut spending — with Medicare and Medicaid often in the cross hairs.

Several articles in The Times offered a preview of some of the discussions that will be under way this week in Congress, as lawmakers take up votes on the budget agreement. Carl Hulse, the chief Congressional correspondent, laid out divisions among House Republicans as they move forward toward votes on the agreement.

Robert Pear notes provisions in the federal health law that would be scrapped under the budget deal:

The budget agreement also takes aim at two provisions of the new health care law. It would cut more than $2 billion set aside for the creation of private nonprofit health insurance cooperatives. It also eliminates a program that would have allowed hundreds of thousands of lower-income workers to opt out of employer-sponsored health plans and use the employer’s contribution to buy coverage on their own, through new insurance exchanges. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the architect of this provision, lamented its demise. “Publicly,” Mr. Wyden said, “both parties say they are champions of choice and competition and making health insurance more affordable for everyone. But then behind closed doors they kill a program that does exactly that. This seems like a victory for special interests.” Many employers had objected to the Wyden provision, saying it would increase their costs by allowing younger and healthier entry-level employees to opt out of employer-sponsored plans.

The Times’s Jackie Calmes offers a glimpse of President Obama’s proposals to be released later this week on lowering deficit spending, and what he may say about Medicare spending and overall health care costs. His top spokesman, David Plouffe, made the rounds of the Sunday news shows, and acknowledged that the president’s plans would include looking at savings in Medicare and Medicaid.

And John Harwood reminds everyone of the risks to tackling entitlements like Medicare.

A core group of health care providers, members of the American Hospital Association, will have a front-row seat to the budget battles during their annual meeting in Washington this week, with several sessions highlighting issues like the insurance exchanges required under the federal health care law.

And along the way, we noticed a few articles related to the business of health care: The Boston Globe reports that Third Rock will be announcing an investment into developing targeted cancer therapies; Children’s Hospital Boston opened a surgery program for overweight teenagers, 13 to 19, who need bariatric surgery because of obesity; The Times’s Pam Belluck looks at proposed changes in rules covering transplants of organs from HIV-infected donors.

Let us know if we should be watching out for other developments this week.",11/04/2011
The New York Times,Iran Says It Jailed 2 Prominent Doctors,"TEHRAN — An Iranian intelligence official said Monday that two prominent doctors jailed since June were among four men sent to prison on charges of plotting against the Iranian government with the suspected backing of the United States, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported.

Fars quoted the unidentified official as saying, “Among the four key elements in this case were two doctors named Arash and Kamiar Alaei.”

The two men, who are brothers, are well-known doctors who founded the country’s first HIV-prevention program.

Iran said last Tuesday that it had tried four men for attempting to overthrow the government with the support of the United States, but it did not disclose their identities or give any information on when they had been arrested and tried.

The official said Monday that “tens” of people were involved in the plot to overthrow the government but that the judiciary arrested only four main leaders. “They purposely cooperated with American intelligence agents in the region and implemented their requests in detail,” the official said of the four men, according to Fars. He did not identify the other two men.",20/01/2009
The New York Times,The Art of Marketing a Water Purifier,"For eight years, Procter & Gamble has tried everything to market its PUR disinfectant powder — a quick way to make filthy water usable and a potential boon for poor nations where unsanitary water causes thousands of deaths each year.

The company has run TV and radio ads, sponsored rock concerts and tinkered with its pricing, and yet for years, the company said, sales were spotty.

That changed 12 months ago, P.&G. said, when for the first time demand outstripped supply. In response, the company in August plans to triple annual production of PUR to 150 million units, in a new factory near the port city of Karachi, Pakistan.

What changed? For starters, the company said it stopped marketing PUR like Pampers, Tide and its other brands.

Instead, it now uses social marketing techniques — similar to those used to promote condom use — that combine education and subsidized product pricing to encourage behavior change and product use.

“We’ve learned to target our approach to people that need it the most — people with really dirty water, people with HIV/AIDS, moms with newborns at health clinics, and malnourished children,” said Dr. Greg Allgood, a toxicologist who directs P.&G.’s nonprofit Children’s Safe Drinking Water program.

“The use for people living with AIDS is a big part of this. We’ll provide more than 20 million sachets to people living with AIDS this year, versus the three million sachets we provided commercially over four years when we pursued a P.&G.-funded commercial approach.”

Between 2001 and 2004, P.&G. spent $10 million test-marketing the product in Guatemala, the Philippines, Morocco and Pakistan. After deeming it a commercial failure in 2004, P.&G. began distributing and marketing the product through a network of aid agencies and nonprofits, led by Population Services International, a global health organization based in Washington.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, P.S.I. and a local aid agency, Association de Santé Familiale, currently distribute PUR through 5,000 health centers, pharmacies, retailers and wholesalers.

Health care workers widely praise PUR for its efficacy in killing pathogens and removing pollutants, like arsenic and DDT. But they have often expressed frustration at its price. Typically, a four-gram packet of PUR costs 3.5 cents to make, 4 cents to distribute, and sells for an average of 10 cents at retail — a price beyond the reach of the world’s poorest.

Other, less sophisticated water disinfectants sold under different brands by P.S.I., like WaterGuard, in Kenya, and Chlorin, in Zambia, cost only a penny.",08/05/2009

The New York Times,Clinton Promises Health Care Plan,"A day after saying that she would take on health care again, despite the political problems it caused her in the 1990s, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday evening that she would soon propose a plan “about how we get to universal coverage.”

A Clinton spokesman, asked for details last night, would only say, “stay tuned,” followed by a smiley face emoticon. Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to “tackle problems of coverage” so everyone is insured for health care; has access to quality care; and can afford the insurance.

Mrs. Clinton made the remark in the third edition of her live video webchats, which, she said, had elicited “tens of thousands of questions” from people visiting her new presidential campaign website.

She also reiterated her views about being tough with Iran and North Korea, combating global warming, and supporting HIV and AIDS research and treatment. Asked what she liked to do in her downtime, she said she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, liked to go to the movies, have dinner out, putter in the garden (“I try to avoid killing everything”), and that she enjoyed reading for pleasure and spending time with friends. “Normal” was the operative word – she used it twice to describe her downtime doings.

“I just like to chill out and do as little as possible,” she said.

Also yesterday, a friend of the Clintons, Steven Spielberg, announced that he would co-host a fundraiser on Feb. 20 for Senator Barack Obama’s presidential exploratory campaign. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are preparing to vie for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Mr. Spielberg is throwing the event at the Beverly Hilton Hotel with his producing partners, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg.

“I don’t have to interview the head of state to enjoy what I’m doing — I’ve done that,” Mr. Stolley said in an interview from his home in Santa Fe, N.M. “Reporting, to me, and the writing, in particular, is a joy in itself.”

Mr. Stolley retired 15 years ago as editorial director of Time Inc. magazines. Three years ago, he moved to Santa Fe and began pitching story ideas. “I think this is true of anyone in our business; your antennae are always up.”

The New York Times,Hillary Clinton Begins Process of Vetting — Herself,"Photo

Hillary Rodham Clinton, the subject of intense news media attention and public scrutiny for the last three decades, is preparing for another thorough vetting as she plans for a likely presidential campaign. In this case, however, it’s not Republicans trying to thwart her or journalists looking for a juicy scoop, but researchers she herself has hired.

Mrs. Clinton, who is all but assured to seek the Democratic presidential nomination for a second time, has hired the firm New Partners, an outfit with a history of doing deep research projects, to handle at least some portion of the work, known in the political world as “self-opposition research.”

She is also close to hiring a research director for her likely campaign, a role that in the 2008 race was filled by Judd Legum, currently the editor in chief for the liberal news site ThinkProgress.

Three people familiar with the early stages of research work for Mrs. Clinton described her plans on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton would not comment, and officials with New Partners did not respond to requests for comment.

The scope of the firm’s work is unclear. But self-research is considered critical in campaigns. And in the six years since Mrs. Clinton was last a candidate, she has created a paper trail of paid speeches, charitable donations and diplomatic decisions as secretary of state.

For months, Democrats not aligned with Mrs. Clinton had privately wondered whether she had started the process of assessing the scope of existing documents, information and other potential material her rivals could use against her. Some expressed concern that she was beginning this self-scrubbing process relatively late, and might not leave herself enough time to learn about her own potential vulnerabilities to be able to respond effectively.

Their concerns were prompted by a string of stories by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website that extensively reviewed archival material at the Clinton presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., and came up with an audio tape of Mrs. Clinton discussing a rape case she had worked on as a defense lawyer in the 1980s.

The tape was a reminder that, with so much scrutiny applied by the news media and Mrs. Clinton’s opponents in her public life, it’s a challenge for rivals to come up with new material, and to make any fresh information stick. That was a frequent problem for President Obama’s campaign when he ran against Mrs. Clinton in the primaries in 2008, when both were senators.

More recently, Republicans and reporters have turned their sights to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation for accepting donations from foreign countries after Mrs. Clinton left the State Department. The scrutiny has focused on which entities donated to the foundation, and whether there was any overlap with Mrs. Clinton’s diplomatic work.

Dennis Cheng, who led the foundation’s recent endowment drive to alleviate some of the fund-raising pressure on former President Bill Clinton, recently departed and is expected to play a big role raising money for another Clinton presidential campaign.

Foundation officials often point out that the entity is a charity, and that many of the foreign donations are targeted grants for programs in places rife with diseases like AIDS and HIV. Still, the focus on the foundation and its work is likely to be a source of ongoing focus for Mrs. Clinton’s opponents. And the spate of recent stories underscore why the self-research process is a relatively urgent task.",20/02/2015

An American baseball player scaling an African mountain for an Indian charity might seem an odd way to draw attention to human trafficking.

But that’s just what R.A. Dickey is doing. The Mets pitcher is climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, which peaks at more than 19,000 feet above sea level (and documenting it on Bats, The New York Times’ Baseball blog) in part to bring awareness and money to stop sexual slavery thousands of miles away in the gritty lanes of Kamathipura – Mumbai’s largest red light district.

About 100,000 to 200,000 women and girls are working in brothels in Mumbai, according to the latest government estimates, which are a decade old. Activists say the number has since reduced to 75,000 to 100,000 in the city.

“As I am the father of two daughters, ages 9 and 8, the thought of my own being subjected to the atrocities that happen every day in the brothels and on the streets of Kamathipura is heartbreaking,” Mr. Dickey wrote for the New York Times baseball blog.

The money will be used to build a fully equipped clinic in Kamathipura that would offer health screenings, antiretroviral drugs, and counseling to sex workers.

Since Mr. Dickey stepped into the picture in May of 2010, Bombay Teen Challenge has met half its fund-raising goal, said the organization’s founder, K. K. Devaraj.

Bombay Teen Challenge, just over two decades old and staffed by about 150 people, has more than a thousand individuals who support their work through donations and volunteering. Mr. Devaraj said that his team provides shelters and homes for about 500 women and children in Mumbai. That includes sex workers, at-risk children and HIV-positive kids.

“We give hope to them,” said Mr. Devaraj, who said he is inspired by the work of Mother Teresa. Bombay Teen Challenge also distributes fresh food and medicines in impoverished areas outside the red light district.

“When I see a destitute child on the road, I feel like I’m seeing it for the first time in my life, my stomach turns,” said Mr. Devaraj, adding that not everyone feels that way in India. “How can people 0be so callous?”

His organization also provides a decent burial for women who die in the red light district – a common albeit disturbing occurrence.

Mr. Devaraj said he’s approached police and government agencies in the past to rescue trafficked girls but the response he gets is that there aren’t places to rehabilitate them – a response he finds bewildering.

“If your daughter is there you’re not going to wait. You’re going to rush in and rescue her, rehabilitate her. You don’t wait for a solution before you take them out.”

Mr. Devaraj said that when Mr. Dickey heard about the plight of sex-trafficked women in Mumbai after mutual friends connected the two men, he immediately offered help.

The New York Times,Gay Rights Group Criticizes Obama,"The nation’s largest gay rights organization criticized Senator Barack Obama of Illinois yesterday for scheduling a gospel concert on Sunday with a singer who has made controversial statements about homosexuality.

Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the gay rights organization, urged Mr. Obama in a phone call yesterday to cancel the appearance of the singer, Donnie McClurkin, who is to sing Sunday night in a gospel concert in Columbia, S.C.

Critics say that Mr. McClurkin counsels that homosexuality is a curse that can be cured through prayer, although in an interview with The Chicago Tribune, Mr. McClurkin said that his words had been misconstrued and that he had not crusaded against gay men and lesbians.

Mr. Obama, a Democratic presidential candidate, has not canceled Mr. McClurkin’s appearance but has scheduled an openly gay minister, the Rev. Andy Sidden, to speak on the concert program. But that did not appear to tamp down criticism from some gay activists or increasingly hostile bloggers.

The controversy reflects the competing interests of two important constituencies of the Democratic Party, with gay activists complaining that Mr. Obama is seeking the support of black evangelicals at their expense. The gospel tour, which begins Friday with other singers, is part of a broader effort by the Obama campaign to win over black evangelicals.

Mr. Obama is in a fierce struggle in South Carolina with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York for the support of black voters, who make up half the electorate in the Democratic primary. The state’s primary, scheduled for mid-January, could be crucial, coming after New Hampshire and Iowa and before several big states vote on Feb. 5.

Mr. Solmonese said in a statement that he appreciated the campaign’s invitation to Mr. Sidden, but added: “There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin’s message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That’s a message that certainly doesn’t belong on any presidential candidate’s stage.”",25/10/2007
The New York Times,Clinton Offers a Few Details About N. Korean Trip,"NEW YORK — It was billed, officially, as an important announcement between former President Bill Clinton’s foundation and three drug companies to lower the price of medicines for HIV/AIDS patients in developing countries.

But the real reason that more than 200 journalists crowded Mr. Clinton’s Harlem office Thursday afternoon, of course, was to see if he would divulge any details about his successful mission to North Korea to win the release of two American journalists.

Mr. Clinton did not bite.

Saying that there could only be “one president at a time,” Mr. Clinton said that “it would be wrong for me to say anything” about the mission, which concluded on Wednesday with the emotional return of the journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee.

So not a word about his impressions of Kim Jong-Il or his reportedly failing health.

Nothing about any diplomatic signals or messages.

Zippo, about any nuclear or foreign policy issues that diplomatic experts assume must have come up in discussions.

“My job was to do one thing, which I was profoundly honored to do, as an American, and as a father: I wanted those young women to be able to come home,” Mr. Clinton said. “Anything I say beyond that could inadvertently affect the decisions and moods either here or in North Korea, or the attitudes of our allies, and I have no business doing that. I’m not a policy maker anymore.”

Mr. Clinton said that he had not said that he had not had a chance to debrief President Obama, or his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, or the National Security Council. But he said, without being specific, that “I will.”

He also repeated what the White House has said about what the journalists told North Korean authorities before being released: They acknowledged venturing into North Korea, they should not have done it.

“I was not asked for any more; nor did I offer anymore,” he said. “What the White House told you on that was factually accurate.”

Mr. Clinton did, however, offer new details on what the flight back to the United Sates was like for the two journalists.

He said that they were “deeply emotional,” and could not sleep, even though they tried. Ms. Lee, he noted, talked at length about the prospect of being reunited with her daughter, Hana. He also said that when the plane stopped at an American military base in Japan, the women got a taste of something that they sorely missed.



“They got their first real old-fashioned American breakfast,” Mr. Clinton said. “Huevos rancheros. And they had to be careful, since they had been on a radically different diet for almost 5 months to measure their intake. It was basically a lovely thing.”",06/08/2009
The New York Times,Abortions Surge in China; Officials Cite Poor Sex Education,"HONG KONG — More than 13 million abortions are performed each year in China, according to statistics disclosed by Chinese health officials on Thursday, a marked increase from 2003, the most recent statistics available.

When unreported and medication-induced abortions are counted, the actual number is substantially higher, according to physicians and medical researchers quoted by the state-run newspaper China Daily on Thursday.

The rate of abortion in China — about 24 abortions for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 — is less than half that of the world’s highest rate. That is Russia’s, at 53.7 per 1,000, according to the United Nations Population Division. Some two million abortions are performed each year in Russia, which has a population of 142 million. China’s population is 1.3 billion.

But the rise in the numbers is significant. In a joint report, the World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute put the number of abortions in China in 2003 at 9 million, out of a total of 42 million worldwide that year.

The New York Times,JERSEY FOOTLIGHTS,"The Social Power of Art

Two new shows at the Jersey City Museum raise social issues of the present, and the past.

''Lightbox: Visual AIDS,'' which runs through May 27, features 10 long, narrow lightboxes -- the kind used to view slides -- displaying 400 images of work created by artists with HIV. A magnifying glass is attached to each box so viewers can take a closer look at the details in the artwork.

''The magnifying glass creates a kind of intimacy,'' said Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, an associate curator at the museum.

The show was created by the New York group the Visual AIDS Archive Project, which aims to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS through the visual arts, and provides services to artists living with the disease.

Through May 11, museum goers can also visit ''Just Another Poster? Chicano Graphic Arts in California,'' which explores the social, cultural, political and artistic legacy of Chicano posters in that state from the 1970's to the present. The subjects of these posters include the boycotts against Coors beer, and grape and lettuce growers, as well as the fight against anti-immigration legislation and opposition to the Vietnam War.",23/02/2003
The New York Times,Suit Accuses Landlord of Discriminating Against Tenant With AIDS,"David Goode, 27, poor and living with AIDS, thought he had found the answer to his homelessness when he saw an Internet listing in February for an apartment in New York for around $1,100 per month.

But when he told the landlord that his rent would be covered by a subsidy from a city program for residents with H.I.V. or AIDS, he said an agent for the company repeatedly told him that it did not accept the subsidy. So on Tuesday, Mr. Goode filed a lawsuit in the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn against the landlord, Goldfarb Properties, accusing it of violating a city law barring discrimination based on the source of a tenant’s income.

Standing before several dozen supporters at a news conference in front of City Hall, Armen H. Merjian, a senior staff attorney for Housing Works, which assists people with H.I.V. and AIDS and filed the lawsuit on Mr. Goode’s behalf, said that housing is critically important for people living with the virus and that the humiliation of a denial only exacerbates their problems.

“It labels us as miasmic,” Mr. Merjian said. “And this is a community already wrestling under society’s prejudices.”",24/06/2015
The New York Times,Senate Moves on AIDS Bill,"After finally breaking a procedural logjam, the Senate this week will move ahead with a $50 billion AIDS initiative that has the support of Democrats, Republicans and the White House. It would seem like a sure bet – except for Senator Jim DeMint.

Mr. DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, forced the Senate last week to take a rare Friday evening procedural vote in order to begin debate on the legislation that seeks to step up AIDS treatment and prevention efforts in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. He then missed the vote he had instigated, provoking scattered boos from the floor – an occurrence more typical of the House than the Senate.

In one of the chief challenges to the AIDS bill, Mr. DeMint is scheduled to offer a proposal to reduce the five-year cost of the legislation to $35 billion. He has complained that Democrats were unfairly trying to limit efforts to change the bill. Given that both Republicans and Democrats were very unhappy with his decision to force them to take a Friday vote he then missed, it is hard to envision a successful outcome for his proposal.



The AIDS bill is promoted by its backers as a way to show a positive side of American foreign policy by providing resources for developing countries struggling with how to care for those who are HIV-positive. Other Republicans also have proposals to alter the bill, but its eventual approval appears likely given strong underlying support and the fact that President Bush would like to see it enacted as one of his final accomplishments.

While the Senate takes up the AIDS bill in earnest, gas prices continue to percolate as a top concern for lawmakers. Later this week, House Democrats could try again to pass their proposal to penalize oil companies that are not exploring the tracts they have already leased from the government, a way to counter the Republican call for more domestic drilling. The floor debate could provide a platform for a showdown over drilling, a rare issue on which Republicans appear to be making some political headway.

In the Senate, a bipartisan group of lawmakers will continue to meet to try to come up with their own compromise energy plan, one likely to include drilling, putting Senate Democrats out in front of their House colleagues on that issue.

The House and Senate will also get about the business of trying to reconcile their legislation to deal with the mortgage crisis, with new pressure to add provisions to stabilize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The rescue package proposed Sunday night requires serious involvement on the part of Congress.",14/07/2008
The New York Times,House Republicans Ease Opposition to Needle Exchanges,"But an outbreak of AIDS and hepatitis tied to heroin and other drug use in states like Indiana and Kentucky has led conservative public officials in those states to reverse themselves and allow needle exchange programs as a way to combat the spread of disease and bring drug users into treatment programs. Notably, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a former Republican House member and a longtime proponent of the ban, recently allowed needle exchanges in parts of his state to counter an AIDS epidemic.

Still, House Republicans led by Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, seemed reluctant to make any changes in the ban, which was first pushed by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina during the Reagan administration. Mr. Rogers’s position brought him some criticism from interests in Kentucky, where communities in his district have been hit hard by drug use.

A spokeswoman for the committee said Mr. Rogers supported the new approach as a modest change that could help with some of the unique drug problems found in his district.

Under the proposed bill, federal money could go toward the support of exchange programs if the state or local community “is experiencing, or is at risk for, a significant increase in hepatitis infections or an HIV outbreak due to injection drug use, and such program is operating in accordance with state and local law.”

Advocates of needle exchanges, which have been found to reduce the spread of infectious diseases and spur drug users to seek counseling and treatment, welcomed the change and credited Mr. Rogers and others on the panel for being open to arguments on behalf of different drug strategies.",17/06/2015
The New York Times,Virus Found in Many With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"Many people with chronic fatigue syndrome are infected with a little known virus that may cause or at least contribute to their illness, researchers are reporting.

The syndrome, which causes prolonged and severe fatigue, body aches and other symptoms, has long been a mystery ailment, and patients have sometimes been suspected of malingering or having psychiatric problems rather than genuine physical ones. Worldwide, 17 million people have the syndrome, including at least one million Americans.

An article published online Thursday in the journal Science reports that 68 of 101 patients with the syndrome, or 67 percent, were infected with an infectious virus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus, or XMRV. By contrast, only 3.7 percent of 218 healthy people were infected. Continuing work after the paper was published has found the virus in nearly 98 percent of about 300 patients with the syndrome, said Dr. Judy A. Mikovits, the lead author of the paper.

XMRV is a retrovirus, a member of the same family of viruses as the AIDS virus. These viruses carry their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA, and they insert themselves into their hosts’ genetic material and stay for life.

Dr. Mikovits and other scientists cautioned that they had not yet proved that the virus causes the syndrome. In theory, people with the syndrome may have some other, underlying health problem that makes them prone to being infected by the virus, which could be just a bystander. More studies are needed to explain the connection.",09/10/2009
The New York Times,Old Viruses Resurrected Through DNA,"Thanks to advances in DNA technology, scientists can now reconstruct new copies of old viruses. Last year United States government scientists reconstructed the virus that caused the influenza epidemic of 1918. Now a team of French scientists has rebuilt a virus that infected our apelike ancestors several million years ago.

The scientists did not isolate a virus from a fossil. Instead, they examined vestiges of the virus that survive today within the human genome.

About 100,000 segments of human DNA are remarkably similar to retroviruses, a class of viruses that includes HIV. Retroviruses insert a copy of their genes into the genome of their host cell. Scientists estimate that 8 percent of the human genome is made up of this viral DNA, known as human endogenous retroviruses, or HERVs.

“Our genome is filled with retroviruses,” said Dr. Thierry Heidmann, an expert on HERVs at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Villejuif, France. “It’s a hard idea to understand, but they are part of our genome.”

Many HERVs found in the human genome have counterparts in the genomes of other species. They infected our distant ancestors millions of years ago, and were passed down from generation to generation. They also produced new copies that could reinfect egg or sperm cells, adding more HERVs to the genome. Over time HERVs were crippled by mutations. Until now, scientists have never found a HERV that acts like a fully functional virus.",07/11/2006
The New York Times,Michelle Obama Serves Lunch at D.C. Nonprofit,"Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press

The homeless men and women gathered at Miriam’s Kitchen as they often do on a Thursday for a cup a coffee, a hot meal, a hair cut and some help finding a job or a place to stay.

But on this day, they received an unexpected greeting from an unexpected visitor. First Lady Michelle Obama was in the kitchen, serving up mushroom risotto and a warm welcome.

“How are you doing?” Mrs. Obama asked the astonished patrons as they lined up for risotto, steamed broccoli, fruit salad and apple-carrot muffins. “My job here is to serve you.”

Miriam’s Kitchen was the latest stop on the first lady’s getting-to-know Washington tour.

“My purpose here is to listen, learn and scoop some risotto,’’ Mrs. Obama told the group of about 50 homeless men and women. She said she hoped her visit would also encourage Americans to volunteer to help the needy during these difficult economic times.



“There is a moment in time when each and every one of us needs a helping hand,’’ Mrs. Obama said. She described Miriam’s Kitchen as “an example of what we can do as a country and a community to help folks when they’re down.”

Miriam’s Kitchen provides homemade meals to 4,000 homeless people a year along with social service assistance, officials said. The soup kitchen, which serves breakfast every day and lunch once a week, does not use processed or canned foods. Instead, meals are prepared with fresh local and organic foods.

Employees at the White House donated eight crates of fresh fruit, including apples, bananas, pineapples and melons, said Scott Schenkelberg, executive director of Miriam’s Kitchen. Some of that fruit was served in the fruit salad on Thursday.

“The cheapest food that you’re going to find is typically processed food, junk food,’’ said Mr. Schenkelberg said. “We could easily fill our menu with those items. We don’t think it’s in the best interest of our clients.’’

Many of the clients – who are overwhelmingly adult men – suffer from hypertension, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and cancer, he said. The soup kitchen is part of Western Presbyterian Church and was established 26 years ago. Mr. Schenkelberg said that the demand for services has been rising recently. The clients at the soup kitchen have typically been the long-time homeless. But now they are seeing an influx in people who have recently lost their homes.

The people who stopped in to eat on Thursday said they were stunned to see Mrs. Obama, who shook many hands in addition to serving food. George Rivera, 52, who found a job and a home with the help of the staff at Miriam’s Kitchen, could not stop smiling. “I never imagined this, not in 100 years,’’ he said.",05/03/2009

A Lost Voice

In the early 1990's, Irwin Chusid, a D.J. for 29 years at WFMU, based in Jersey City, discovered a record album of radio dramas made by a man named Judson Fountain.

Mr. Chusid's friend Don Brockway had bought the album in a secondhand store for a dollar. The record, made by Mr. Fountain with help from friends, featured two amateurish radio dramas modeled on those made in the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Sample dialogue: ''Now you see this? If you don't know what it is, I'll tell you. It's a gun.''

''He didn't display a lot of talent,'' said Mr. Chusid of Mr. Fountain. ''But he did display a lot of enthusiasm.''

Mr. Chusid began playing Mr. Fountain's record during his radio shows, eliciting strong reactions -- both positive and negative -- from listeners and other D.J.'s. He later found out about other albums Mr. Fountain had made, between 1969 and 1974. ''They were every bit as strong, wonderful and outsider as the first one,'' he said.

He also met Mr. Fountain, who was born in 1952 and lived in Jersey City and worked as a diner deliveryman, Mr. Chusid said. Mr. Fountain even performed some of his dramas on Mr. Chusid's show on the day before Halloween in 1995, he added.

A few years later, Mr. Chusid tried to find Mr. Fountain again; he could not. But a few years after that, Mr. Chusid's girlfriend, Barbara Economon, suggested that they produce a CD of Mr. Fountain's work.

The result is ''Completely in the Dark: Tales of Mystery and Suspense by Judson Fountain,'' a compilation of Mr. Fountain's radio dramas recorded from 1969 to 1974, to be released on March 24 by Innova Records, a nonprofit label in St. Paul, Minn.

Meanwhile, Mr. Chusid has continued to try to find Mr. Fountain, with no success.

''Judson's work is characterized by cliché scripting, egregious ethnic accents, and inept editing -- all seasoned with copious needle drops of creaking doors and howling wolves from the timeless Elektra sound effects library,'' Mr. Chusid writes in the liner notes. ''But this extreme amateurism and unwavering sincerity synergize to great advantage in Fountain's theatricals.''

The New York Times,Fight in Ukraine Parliament Reflects Turmoil in Politics,"A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.

TODAY’S TOP STORY

The Ukrainian parliament witnessed a fist fight between members of the Orange coalition and the Party of Regions, giving newspapers the opportunity to make use of their abundant Ukrainian puns. Opposition papers express disappointment in the Orange coalition which, in the words of Vedomosti, “is not ready for a civilized fight.”

During the past week, Victor F. Yanukovich became leader of the new parliamentary majority, uniting his Party of Regions with the Socialist and Communist Parties. This Tuesday in Kiev, this new coalition was to formerly submit Mr. Yanukovich as candidate for Prime Minister. However, members of the Orange coalition, which unites Yulia V. Tymoshenko’s Bloc and President Viktor A. Yushchenko’s Our Russia party, tried to disrupt the proceedings using megaphones and physical force. Kommersant reported that they first sought to “stonewall” the proceedings using megaphones with sirens while heckling the parliamentary speaker Oleksandr O. Moroz. After throwing eggs at the “traitor” Socialist party, the members of the orange coalition attempted to occupy the podium surrounded by members of the Party of Regions, Izvestia said. Fights broke out between the two factions and in one instance, a few of the members of the “regions” men picked up a member of Ms. Tymoshenko’s Bloc and “threw him to the floor,” according to Kommersant.

Gazeta wrote that “Ukraine’s upper house looks more and more like a boxing ring” while according to Vedomosti, events in Kiev looked like a “circus side-show.” Moreover, continued Vedomosti, those not included in the coalition have demonstrated their unwillingness to “work with the opposition in a civilized manner.” European socialists have “condemned the acts of Oleksandr Moroz” that brought about the collapse of the Orange coalition, wrote Nezavisimaya Gazeta. According to their report, Our Ukraine has decided not to unite with the new coalition and is preparing for new parliamentary elections, while Yulia Tymoshenko’s Bloc has announced it will transition into “radical opposition.” While Ms. Tymoshenko’s Bloc prepares the appropriate legal argument for the President to call new parliamentary elections, Ukraine remains a state without a government.

MILINKEVICH AGAINST UNION WITH RUSSIA: Aleksandr Milinkevich, the leader of the opposition in Belarus, wrote a letter to each participant in the Group of Eight asking them not to allow the unification of Belarus and Russia. The unification of the two countries is outlined in a 1996 treaty between Belarus and Russia, and is currently caught up in negotiations. The letter has a separate section addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin outlining arguments against unification. The Russian embassy in Minsk refused to accept it. According to Mr. Milinkevich, a referendum on the issue will most likely be set for January 2007. “A referendum in a country, where the last elections and referendums were not recognized by the international democratic community, is a priori illegitimate,” Mr. Milinkevich told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Mr. Milinkevich asked Mr. Putin to receive his letter as a sign of patriotism rather than an “act of unfriendliness.”

ROSSISKAYA GAZETA

AIDS AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC DESERT: Writing on the topic of Russia’s AIDS epidemic, morality, and demographics, Rossiskaya Gazeta argues for a return to the traditional values of “respect for the family, love, and fidelity.” In Russia there are 350,000 registered cases of HIV infections, but according to the United Nations 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, there are up to an additional 1.6 million people living with HIV. “AIDS is spread almost exclusively among those who violate moral prescriptions” the article says. Russia is wavering between turning toward or away from traditional norms of the type found within the American neo-conservative community, norms like “not using drugs, not propagating homosexuality, and turning away from the cult of sex.” Given Russia’s negative population growth, resolving the AIDS problem is of utmost importance. The government needs to turn back to traditional norms in a “rational feeling of self-preservation,” the article concludes.

GAZPROM WITHOLDING INFORMATION: This year Gazprom will work under an investment program that has not been approved by the cabinet of ministers. Monopolies in Russia are subject to budgetary approval by the government in order to evaluate the basis for the company’s claim on the tariffs they impose, as well as an indicator for future inflation. Officials are complaining that Gazprom is withholding the information necessary for them to evaluate the gas monopoly’s investment program. Questions surrounding the purchase of Sibneft and projected prices for countries like Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova have therefore yet to be answered. Vedomosti points out that the discussion surrounding state oversight of Gazprom, a state-controlled company, is at the center of this recent conflict.",12/07/2006
The New York Times,Matt Damon Tries to Get Clean Water and Toilets for India’s Poor,"Photo

Matt Damon finds it a challenge to get people to care about water. It’s why he was in India from Aug. 23 to 26 on a four-day tour. Not to promote his latest film Elysium, a sci-fi dystopia with a socialist underpinning, but to help the rural and urban poor in India get access to clean water and sanitation by investing in tube wells, hand pumps and toilets with proper drainage facilities.

Mr. Damon cofounded Water.org, a Missouri-based nonprofit organization that partners with microfinance institutions to facilitate loans, so that people can afford the “dignity of a toilet” and “clean water.” In the five years that the organization has been active in India, it has helped 500,000 people in 11 states get microloans, and now the goal is increase this to 800,000 by 2016. It is a high bar that Mr. Damon and the group’s cofounder, Gary White, have set for themselves. Along with Mr. White, an engineer who has been working in the field of water sanitation for 23 years, Mr. Damon visited villages in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and urban slums in Bangalore, talking to women and children who have benefited from the project.

The actor has shed all traces of his latest character — the bald, tattooed, gun-toting Max Da Costa desperate for salvation in Elysium. On his India tour, he was Matt Damon, the philanthropist fighting for clean water, a role he takes very seriously.

“Going out, doing these side visits and talking to women about how empowering and liberating this is for them is the funnest part,” Mr. Damon said in an interview in Mumbai on Monday. Instead of spending hours waiting to collect water, women can seek employment and earn an income.

“To hear that they no longer have to leave the house when the sun goes down and walk out for open defecation because there is no toilet,” he said. “It’s very emotional to talk about these very, very real changes. It is sheer joy.

He arrived in India Sunday afternoon, and spent two days in villages at Kanchipuram, Pondicherry and Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, after which he traveled to Bangalore, where he toured two urban slums and spoke to women and self-help groups.

A woman Mr. Damon and Mr. White spoke to in Bangalore used to pay two rupees every time she wanted to use a public toilet. On a typical day, she and her family of seven would spend 20 rupees to use the toilet and an equal amount on bathing facilities. The woman and her family were committed to getting a water and sanitation loan, and constructed a toilet with proper drainage facilities in their home, Mr. White said. The family’s monthly repayment is around 1,200 rupees ($18). The average interest rate is 18 to 22 percent. Water.org is not a charity as much as it helps empower people to plan, finance and execute their own solutions.

For the actor, the rawest and most emotional aspect of his work is the response from women and children.

“Whenever you bring water and sanitation to a community, the response is exactly the same, be it in India or Haiti or anywhere,” he said. “There is absolute elation and joy. You sit down and interview people and hear about the changes in their lives, the dramatic impact.”

The development aid organization sees women as vehicles of change.

“It’s no secret that if you really want to affect the greatest change, you need women,” Mr. Damon said. “Maybe I’m biased because I have four daughters. But girls are better.”

He recalled an interaction with a 13-year-old girl from Haiti who, before the organization’s intervention, would spend three hours a day collecting and hauling water for her family. He asked her what she was going to do with the free time.

“I asked her if she was going to get more time for homework, and she said, ‘I don’t need more time for homework. I’m the smartest in my class,’” he recalled. “And she said this in a way that I knew she was the smartest in her class. She said, ‘I’m going to play.’ I realized that the girl was the same age as my oldest daughter.”

Mr. White said that almost 90 percent of the borrowers are women.

“It’s interesting, because though India is patriarchal, I see so many strong women here; the leadership they exhibit especially when it comes to health, hygiene, water and sanitation.”

The two men met in New York in 2008 at the Clinton Global Initiative and officially launched Water.org the next year when the actor merged his nonprofit, H2O Africa, with WaterPartners, an organization that Gary White cofounded in 1990.

“H2O Africa was something we created to try identify smaller NGOs that were doing good work. But as I started digging into the water issue, I realized that that wasn’t really the solution,” Mr. Damon said. He wanted to take a more sophisticated and sustainable approach, and started looking for people who were experts in this field. “That’s what led me to Gary.”

Water.org works with local communities, NGOs and municipal authorities in developing nations such as India, Bangladesh, Haiti, Ethiopia and Kenya. What sets it apart from the majority of nonprofit organizations is its operational model and a system called Water Credit, which Mr. White had launched in India in 2007 by partnering with microfinance institutions. Initially, it was a challenge because microfinance institutions did not believe that this was an income-generating market. The organization corrected this misconception by providing microfinance institutions grants to undertake market research and prove to themselves that there is a demand in this sector, launch a new portfolio, and hire experts to administer the loans.

This model has the power to eliminate loan sharks and middlemen. One woman they met in Bangalore had gone to a money lender and was paying a 125 percent interest on her loan.

“People are willing to do these extraordinary things for the dignity of a toilet,” Mr. White said. “We jumpstart the market. Once we provide them with that support, microfinance institutions can borrow from commercial banks and then reach out to those in need.”

The immediate hurdle is the rising cost of capital. “We really hope that we can find ways to bring water and sanitation into the priority lending sector,” he said.

For Mr. Damon, the most challenging part is drumming up awareness and publicity because Americans typically can’t relate to the problem of not having access to water. The fact that a child dies every 21 seconds because of lack of access to clean water seems to register with people, the actor said, but he admitted that creating awareness is a hurdle.

“Gary and I are still trying to figure out how to make it land with people,” he said. “In America, people have never met anybody who could not go to the kitchen sink for a glass of water.”

Clean water and sanitation issues simply do not have the same resonance as war, starvation, malnutrition and other evils that the poor are most vulnerable to.

“Americans can relate to something like HIV/AIDs personally,” Mr. Damon said. “You may know people who have HIV, but you don’t know any children who died because they had diarrhea in America.”

Rather than preaching to the masses, he uses humor to get the message across. So earlier this year, he staged a mock press conference and announced that he was going on a toilet strike until every person in the world had access to clean water and sanitation. The video was part of a well thought-out campaign. Mr. Damon’s friends, including Bono and Richard Branson, joined the strike.

“It was very nice of them because mind you, not going to the toilet is very painful,” he said.

There is a quiet intensity in Mr. Damon’s and Mr. White’s determination to expand the reach of Water.org. Theirs is a symbiotic relationship — Mr. White’s expertise and Mr. Damon’s star power — fueled by their common concern for a problem that affects 780 million people across the world.
