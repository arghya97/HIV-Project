NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics' loss widens in 4Q,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. saw its loss widen in the October-December period compared with a year earlier due to higher personnel and acquisition costs, executives said Thursday.

The Medford manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika and other infectious diseases reported a loss of $3.2 million in the final three months of last year compared with a loss of $2 million in 2017.

Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $7.6 million, a year-over-year gain of 27 percent. Much of the growth came from sale of point-of-care tests.

Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said the company had “strong product sales growth” and made progress on “strategic and operational initiatives that will lay the foundation for continued growth.”

Among the initiatives is a planned consolidation of multiple offices in Medford and a warehouse in Holbrook into one building in Hauppauge, and to use robots for some production work. The $3.9 million project recently won tax breaks from Suffolk County.

Chembio employs 223 people in Suffolk, according its application for tax breaks. The company also has a factory in Malaysia and offices in Germany.

For the year, Chembio reported a loss of $7.9 million compared with a loss of $6.4 million. The company last reported an annual profit in 2013.

Revenue for the year totaled $33.4 million, up 39 percent from 2017.

Sperzel said Thursday that Chembio will have revenue of $36 million to $40 million this year.

Separately, he announced receipt of a contract to supply UNICEF with up to $3.5 million worth of ""multiplex"" tests. The 15-minute tests, using one sample of blood, can detect three diseases: Zika, chikungunya and dengue.

Sperzel said the contract is contingent on receipt of Europe’s CE mark certification, completion of clinical and analytical performance evaluations and a quality management system inspection.

He said the Zika/chikungunya/dengue test ""is a clear advantage compared to other testing options, such as laboratory tests which are time consuming, or molecular tests which have a short window of detection.""

The announcement of the contract and company earnings came after the stock market closed. Chembio shares were down 13 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $6.69 on the NASDAQ stock market on Thursday.",07/03/2019
NewsDay,Human Rights Campaign to honor Christina Aguilera,"The nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization is honoring Christina Aguilera with its Ally for Equality award.

The Human Rights Campaign announced Thursday the six-time Grammy-winning singer is a true ""LGBTQ icon"" who uses her platform to ""share a message of hope and inspiration"" to those who have been marginalized.

The group said the 38-year-old recording artist has raised money to fight HIV/AIDS, advocated for marriage equality and spoken out against LGBTQ bullying. The campaign noted that Aguilera's 2002 single ""Beautiful"" is an empowering LGBTQ anthem.

NewsDay,Second medical marijuana dispensary in Suffolk County set to open this month,"A medical marijuana dispensary expects to open at the end of March on Broadhollow Road in East Farmingdale.

The business will open without Babylon Town amending its code, which town officials initially believed necessary to ensure it could operate under zoning use regulations.

When Acreage Holdings presented its plans to town officials in January, Supervisor Rich Schaffer and other town officials believed the section of town code that limited vape shops and hookah bars to industrial areas applied to medical marijuana shops.

The town board held two public hearings on Feb. 13 to consider amending the code, but spokesman Kevin Bonner said upon further review, the code changes weren’t necessary in this case, and the town issued the company a building permit.

The dispensary, which will be called The Botanist, plans to open in March, according to an Acreage Holdings spokeswoman, in an existing building at 2365 Broadhollow Rd. that needs interior modifications.

It would be only the second such dispensary in Suffolk County, with the other located on Main Street in Riverhead run by Columbia Care. A third location is “coming soon” to an unspecified location, according to the state Department of Health.

Acreage Holdings is one of 10 companies with operating licenses from the state Department of Health to grow the marijuana plant and each run four dispensaries throughout the state.

The dispensaries sell the product in non-smokable form to New Yorkers with qualifying conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, PTSD, chronic pain and to treat opioid use.

Patients must first be evaluated by a medical marijuana-trained doctor and referred for the drug, then obtain a state Department of Health ID card.

As of March 6, there are 92,937 certified patients in the state and 2,233 registered practitioners, according to the state Department of Health.

In 2016, the state gave licenses to five companies with permission to sell medical marijuana at four dispensaries each, for a total of 20 statewide. Since then, the state has expanded its program to allow an additional 20 dispensaries.

Acreage Holdings opened another dispensary under the same name at 138-72 Queens Blvd. in Jamaica on Feb. 20.

Currently there are two dispensaries in Nassau County, one on Glen Cove Road in Carle Place and one on Marcus Avenue in Lake Success, and the Department of Health lists a third as coming soon to Nassau, although no town is listed.",07/03/2019
NewsDay,Researchers: London man becomes second patient to survive HIV,"A man known only as the London Patient is the second in the world to be pronounced cured of HIV by way of a bone marrow transplant, but the director of a leading center for the treatment of the infection on Long Island pointed to less-invasive methods of effectively addressing the virus.

Word of the London Patient came nearly 12 years to the day when doctors in Germany announced the cure of Timothy Brown, known at the time as the Berlin Patient. The new case study was published Monday in the journal Nature and presented Tuesday in Seattle at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections by the British team involved in the patient’s treatment.

The London Patient has been in remission for 18 months following a bone marrow transplant that suffused his immune system with healthy stem cells, progenitors of infection-fighting components capable of defeating HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, doctors said.

Brown, the Berlin Patient, also underwent a bone marrow transplant for treatment of his HIV infection. He told Newsday in a 2015 interview the same transplant also cured him of acute myeloid leukemia. The treatment, he said, gave his immune system a clean slate. His cure was verified by doctors at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

“At the moment, the only way to treat HIV is with medications that suppress the virus, which people need to take for their entire lives, posing a particular challenge in developing countries,” Dr. Ravindra Gupta said in a statement Tuesday. He led a consortium of physicians and scientists from Imperial College London, the University College London, Cambridge University and Oxford University who were involved in the patient’s case.

“Finding a way to eliminate the virus entirely is an urgent global priority, but is particularly difficult because the virus integrates into the white blood cells of its host,” Gupta said.

Bone marrow transplants are formidable treatments, Dr. Joseph McGowan, medical director of Northwell Health’s Center for AIDS Research and Training in Manhasset, said in an email Tuesday. McGowan is attending the same Seattle conference as the team that treated the London Patient.

A bone marrow transplant requires the infusion of chemotherapy, sometimes accompanied by radiation, to destroy a patient’s diseased blood-forming tissues in the bone marrow. Healthy marrow from a donor is then infused by IV afterward, priming the body to produce healthy new oxygen-carrying red blood cells and white blood cells that fight infections.

“Both cases of people being effectively cured to date required bone marrow transplants to treat life-threatening conditions,” McGowan said. “Current antiretroviral therapy is safe and effective at suppressing HIV to undetectable levels, preventing HIV transmission, allowing restoration of immune function often to normal levels, and can allow people to achieve normal life expectancy.""

McGowan added that treatments for HIV are becoming so simplified that a single pill contains a full treatment regimen.

Last week, doctors at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced a clinical trial for an experimental HIV treatment involving a once-a-month injection, aimed at suppressing the virus to undetectable levels.

There are serious limitations to bone marrow transplants, which can be risky, McGowan said. Patients are vulnerable to a host of complications, including life-threatening infections. If the patient’s own bone marrow is not completely obliterated, he added, residual cells might harbor the virus. There’s also the need to find a matching donor, which can be difficult, if not impossible.

“Any potential cure would have to be at least as safe and effective as standard antiretroviral treatments,” McGowan said.

The London Patient was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 but did not start antiretroviral therapy until 2012, according to a news release from Imperial College London. The patient developed non-Hodgkins lymphoma that year.

Both the London and Berlin patients were treated with stem cell transplants from donors carrying a genetic mutation — CCR5 — that blocks HIV.",05/03/2019
NewsDay,Second man seems to be free of AIDS virus after transplant,"SEATTLE — A London man appears to be free of the virus that causes AIDS after a stem cell transplant, the second success including the ""Berlin patient,"" doctors reported.

The therapy had an early success with Timothy Ray Brown, a U.S. man treated in Germany who is 12 years post-transplant and still free of HIV. Until now, Brown is the only person thought to have been cured of infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Such transplants are dangerous and have failed in other patients. They're also impractical to try to cure the millions already infected.

The latest case ""shows the cure of Timothy Brown was not a fluke and can be recreated,"" said Dr. Keith Jerome of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who had no role. He added that it could lead to a simpler approach that could be used more widely.

The case, published online Monday by the journal Nature, was presented Tuesday at an HIV conference in Seattle.

Brown sat in the front row, stood for a round of applause and shook hands with lead researcher Ravindra Gupta of University College London after Gupta presented details on the London patient.

The patient has not been identified. He was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and started taking drugs to control the infection in 2012. It's unclear why he waited that long. He developed Hodgkin lymphoma that year and agreed to a stem cell transplant to treat the cancer in 2016.

With the right kind of donor, his doctors figured, the London patient might get a bonus beyond treating his cancer: a possible HIV cure.

Doctors found a donor with a gene mutation that confers natural resistance to HIV. About 1 percent of people descended from northern Europeans have inherited the mutation from both parents and are immune to most HIV. The donor had this double copy of the mutation.

That was ""an improbable event,"" said Gupta. ""That's why this has not been observed more frequently.""

The transplant changed the London patient's immune system, giving him the donor's mutation and HIV resistance.

The patient voluntarily stopped taking HIV drugs to see if the virus would come back.

Usually, HIV patients expect to stay on daily pills for life to suppress the virus. When drugs are stopped, the virus roars back, usually in two to three weeks.

That didn't happen with the London patient. There is still no trace of the virus after 18 months off the drugs.

Researchers from eight countries are tracking 45 patients with cancer and HIV who have or will soon have stem cell transplants. One of them, a Dusseldorf, Germany, man, is showing no signs of HIV after several months after stopping treatment drugs, but it is too soon to tell if he, too, could be in remission.

Calling the London patient ""cured"" is tricky, Gupta said, because there is no standard definition for how long someone must remain free of virus and off treatment drugs. ""We are being cautious"" to call it remission for now, he said.

Brown said he would like to meet the London patient and would encourage him to go public because ""it's been very useful for science and for giving hope to HIV-positive people, to people living with HIV,"" he told The Associated Press Monday.

Stem cell transplants typically are harsh procedures which start with radiation or chemotherapy to damage the body's existing immune system and make room for a new one. There are complications too. Brown had to have a second stem cell transplant when his leukemia returned.

Compared to Brown, the London patient had a less punishing form of chemotherapy to get ready for the transplant, didn't have radiation and had only a mild reaction to the transplant.

Dr. Gero Hutter, the German doctor who treated Brown, called the new case ""great news"" and ""one piece in the HIV cure puzzle.""",05/03/2019
NewsDay,Misonix hires former Chembio exec: SEC filing,"Medical device maker Misonix Inc. has hired a former Chembio Diagnostics Inc. executive who stepped in as acting CEO at Chembio during 2017.

Sharon W. Klugewicz, 51, was named chief operating officer at Farmingdale-based Misonix effective Friday, according to a government filing. She will oversee Misonix's manufacturing, regulatory affairs and research and development.

Shares of Misonix closed up 15 cents to $19.38 on Tuesday. Twelve months ago the stock was trading at $10.

Misonix, which makes ultrasonic devices used in neurosurgery and spine, cosmetic and orthopedic surgery, is the third publicly traded Long Island company on Klugewicz's resume.

Stavros Vizirgianakis, Misonix president and CEO, said in a statement that the COO position was created in the first half of fiscal 2019 to ""accelerate the execution of our growth strategy.""

Klugewicz said she is ""excited ... to be part of a fast-growing company that is leveraging its unique proprietary ultrasonic technology to bring to market medical devices that deliver demonstrated clinical benefits.""

She joined Medford-based Chembio in 2012 and most recently served as senior vice president and chief quality and regulatory officer at the maker of tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola and other diseases. Chembio announced her resignation in February.

Klugewicz was named acting CEO at Chembio in May 2017 when CEO John J. Sperzel took a medical leave to have a heart transplant. He resumed his CEO duties in October 2017.

Klugewicz is currently senior vice president and chief quality and regulatory officer for the manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika and other infectious diseases.

In May 2017, Klugewicz was appointed acting CEO by the Chembio board of directors when CEO John J. Sperzel took a medical leave to have a heart transplant because of a rare disease. She resumed her duties as president of operations in North and South America when Sperzel returned to work in October of that year.

NewsDay,Court dismisses most charges against pharmacist in black-market HIV drug case,"A state appellate court this week dismissed most of the charges against a Babylon pharmacist convicted of selling black-market drugs to treat HIV.

The Appellate Division Second Department ruled that the state attorney general's office overreached in charging Ira Gross, 65, with first-degree grand larceny, first-degree criminal diversion of prescription medication, first-degree money laundering and related charges. Gross remains convicted of first-degree commercial bribery and second-degree money laundering, and remains in prison serving 2 to 6 years on those charges.

Gross and others were accused of diverting expensive HIV antiretroviral medications purchased off the street and selling them to the former MOMS Pharmacy in Melville. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. MOMS Pharmacy then dispensed the diverted medications to thousands of its unsuspecting patients, many of whom were Medicaid recipients, throughout New York and other states, including Massachusetts, Florida and California, prosecutors said.

They argued that Gross was guilty of grand larceny because his actions defrauded the pharmacy of money by falsely saying the drugs were legal to sell. But the court, in a lengthy decision by Judge Sandra Sgroi, said that because one of Gross' conspirators was a top official at the pharmacy, the drugstore knew what it was selling and could not be seen as a victim.

All the counts that relied on a claim of theft from the pharmacy must therefore be dismissed, the court ruled.

The criminal diversion of prescription medication was dismissed for a different reason. This statute is intended to criminalize street sales of prescription drugs, not brokering black-market sales of medication from a wholesale company to a pharmacy, as Gross was accused of doing, Sgroi wrote.

If the State Legislature wants to make such activity illegal, it could pass a law doing so, Sgroi wrote. Until then, she wrote that it is improper to stretch the law to make it fit these actions.

Both the state attorney general's office and Gross' appellate attorney did not respond to requests for comment.",25/01/2019
NewsDay,Medical marijuana dispensary applies for East Farmingdale location,"Babylon Town officials are considering approving an application for a medical marijuana dispensary in East Farmingdale. It would be the second marijuana dispensary in Suffolk County.

Acreage Holdings officials presented their proposal to town officials Wednesday, hoping to locate its fourth dispensary called “The Botanist” in a building just north of Smith Street on Broadhollow Road.

Acreage Holdings is one of 10 companies to receive operating licenses from the state Department of Health to grow the plant and run four dispensaries throughout the state. They have operating licenses in 19 states and will have 74 dispensaries open by the end of the year, according to the company’s chief operating officer, Robert Daino.

When Acreage Holdings spoke with town officials Wednesday, Supervisor Rich Schaffer said the town would most likely accept the application, as long as it doesn’t violate the town code, which prohibits new vape shops and hookah bars from business districts, allowing them only in industrial zoning.

If the town were to determine a medical marijuana dispensary falls under that code, the business would need special approval to operate the location at 2635 Broadhollow Rd.

“We want to get our code up to speed to accommodate medical marijuana locations,” Schaffer said to Daino and other Acreage staff. He later added, “I believe we have what we need . . . so you can get your building permit.”

When the medical marijuana program rolled out in 2016, only five companies were licensed to grow and then sell the drug at four dispensaries each, for a total of 20 statewide. That number has since doubled to 40, and the East Farmingdale dispensary would be among those additional locations.

The only other dispensary in Suffolk County is on Main Street in Riverhead, run by Columbia Care. A third dispensary owned by Valley Agriceuticals LLC is listed on the Department of Health’s website as coming soon to Suffolk County, without a specific town.

There are two dispensaries in Nassau County, one on Glen Cove Road in Carle Place, and one on Marcus Avenue in Lake Success. The Department of Health lists a third as coming soon to Nassau, although no town is listed.

Only New York State residents who have qualifying conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, and most recently, PTSD and chronic pain, can apply for the program.

Insurance doesn’t cover the treatment, so patients must pay out-of-pocket.

Patients with a qualifying condition must get a referral from a doctor trained in the state’s medical marijuana program, then apply for a Department of Health ID card.

The program, passed as New York's Compassionate Care Act in 2014, allows medical marijuana in non-smokable form, in pill or oil form.

As of Jan. 15, there are 87,033 certified patients and 2,139 registered practitioners in the state.

NewsDay,Nassau's new IG for contracting has fought City Hall before,"Jodi Franzese fought City Hall and vows to bring the same investigative spirit to Nassau County as its first ever inspector general.

As senior inspector general in New York City’s Department of Investigations, Franzese led a probe that showed city officials were involved in a decision to convert a Lower East Side hospice for people with HIV/AIDS into luxury condos.

Her July 2016 report relied on thousands of city documents and records, and interviews with 50 people, including Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The condo conversion came after a developer paid the city to lift a deed restriction requiring the building to be used as a nonprofit residential health care facility.

“It was a huge fight and it was totally on the cover on all of the papers. But we just had to put our heads down and do our job,” Franzese said. “We kept pushing through. People were yelling at us — no one likes oversight, I get it.”

In her new role in Nassau, which began Jan. 3, Franzese will launch the first independent Nassau government agency since the Office of Legislative Budget Review in 1996.

The inspector general's office — which is separate from the county executive — will review, investigate and research contracts with county vendors to ensure political relationships don't influence the contracting process.

County legislators who created the position say Franzese will have “broad powers,” including the ability to issue subpoenas and interview officials under oath.

Sign up for the Power on Trial newsletter Get our insider's look and analysis of the key moments in the Manganos' retrial. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In an interview, Franzese she won't be afraid to use such tools make sure taxpayer money isn’t wasted.

“Even the presence of a watchman can change behavior,” said Franzese, 47, of Massapequa.

Franzese's salary is $150,000, according to budget estimates, and her office will receive more than $550,000 for staff. Six new hires should be enough to get the office started, she said.

The appointment of an independent inspector general in Nassau follows several indictments of elected officials in cases involving county contracting.

Former state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos of Rockville Centre, was charged with illegally influencing the awarding of a $12 million county contract to a stormwater company that employed his son, Adam.

Skelos was convicted in a retrial in July after his 2015 conviction was overturned on an appeal, and last week began serving a sentence of 4 years and 3 months in prison.

Former Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and his wife, Linda, were indicted on federal charges in October 2017.

Prosecutors allege they received bribes and kickbacks from restaurateur Harendra Singh, a longtime friend, in exchange for helping Singh obtain contracts and loan guarantees by the Town of Oyster Bay.

Edward Mangano faces seven felony counts, including program bribery, honest-services wire fraud, extortion and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Linda Mangano faces five felony counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice and making false statements to the FBI.

They have pleaded not guilty and their case is scheduled to be retried this month after a mistrial was declared in May.

Also, Mangano's former chief deputy Rob Walker, a former state assemblyman from Hicksville, is awaiting a federal trial scheduled for April for allegedly taking $5,000 in cash from an unnamed Nassau County contractor, according to prosecutors.

Walker pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing justice and making false statements to the FBI.

In a report in July 2015, Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas called the county’s process for awarding contracts ""a recipe for corruption.""

Singas found the county’s paper-based contracting system had ""serious systematic deficiencies."" For instance, she said, there was no easy way to cross-check officials' financial disclosure and campaign finance disclosure statements for conflicts of interest with vendors.

Singas later pressed county legislators to create an independent inspector general's office to deal with contracting conflicts.

The GOP-controlled county Legislature agreed to create an inspector general’s office in December 2017, following a pressure campaign by Democrats who declined to provide the votes to authorize county borrowing for expenses other than public safety.

""Unfortunately, we would have liked to see an IG sooner rather than later, which might have prevented some of the financial indiscretions that have been alleged,"" said Minority Leader Legis. Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport).

Abrahams said a watchdog is important to have no matter who the county executive is because ""it protects the institution."" He said Democrats are confident Franzese ""will be able to stand up to any of the pressures of that office.""

Presiding Officer Richard Nicolello (R-New Hyde Park) said creation of the inspector general's office had bipartisan support.

However, Nicolello during the Mangano administration spoke out against hiring an IG. “If you’re worried about public corruption, the last thing you want to do is create an office with virtually unlimited powers in this county,” he said in May 2017.

Asked recently why he changed his mind, he said he ""wanted to have a clean slate going into 2018,"" when he became presiding officer and Democrat Laura Curran took over as county executive.

Franzese was selected after a monthslong, national search that yielded about 30 prospective candidates. She emerged early as a finalist because of her work in New York City, county legislators said.

At the city Department of Investigation, Francese managed employees including investigators, attorneys and data analysts who conducted confidential investigations into allegations of corruption, official misconduct and fraud.

Franzese's former boss Mark Peters, who left his post as DOI's commissioner in November, called Franzese ""a great investigator. She’s smart. She’s tenacious. She's thorough and Nassau is lucky to have her.""

Under the Nassau County charter, updated last spring to include the inspector general's position, Franzese is authorized to ""eradicate fraud"" and other abuses by elected and appointed county officers, employees and agencies and county vendors, contractors and subcontractors.

However, the IG won't have the power to probe the county legislature or the legislature's independent Office of Budget Review,"" according to the charter.

In a statement, Curran said she looked forward to working with Franzese to ""continue to make Nassau County a model for compliance and good government.""

Curran, who in the final days of her 2017 campaign ran on an anti-corruption platform, said “restoring ethics, trust and transparency in county government has been the cornerstone of my administration.""

Singas spokesman Brendan Brosh called Franzese's hiring ""an incremental step forward.""

""We look forward to partnering with Ms. Franzese and her staff in the future,” Brosh said.

Franzese, who has a law degree from St. John's University, said she began to hone her skills during her 17 years working as a prosecutor in the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, first taking on child-abuse cases and then moving on to white-collar crimes.

Keri Herzog, Suffolk DA's deputy bureau chief for child abuse and domestic violence, said Franzese has ""impeccable integrity"" and a ""very analytical"" mind.

“When you first meet her, you might not realize what kind of legal brain is at work there. She’s also probably one of the funniest attorneys I’ve ever worked with,” Herzog said.

Franzese, a mother of three who is married to Frabrizio Spagnolo, an evolutionary biologist, said she was excited to put her skills to use in her own county. Born and raised in Brooklyn and Queens, she has lived in Massapequa since 2003.

She isn't affiliated with a political party and has no intention of allowing politics to influence her work, she said.

“What’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong,” Franzese said. “I was raised that way.”",14/01/2019
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics gets European approval to sell new test,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. announced Monday that a new rapid blood test, developed with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, has been certified as meeting European health and safety standards.

The test, which detects a biomarker, or substance that shows a disease or infection in the body, has received the CE mark, which is necessary to sell products in European Union member countries.

Chembio and AstraZeneca haven't disclosed what the biomarker is.

The CE designation, an abbreviation of Conformité Européenne, comes a year after Chembio, a small public company in Medford, began receiving funds from AstraZeneca to develop the point-of-care test. AstraZeneca, with headquarters in Cambridge, England, was to pay Chembio up to $2.9 million for the test.

AstraZeneca sells the acid reflux medicine Nexium and other drugs.

“We are pleased to receive the CE mark within 12 months of announcing the collaboration with AstraZeneca,” Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said Monday. “We look forward to working closely with AstraZeneca in pursuit of additional regulatory approvals.”

Chembio develops and manufactures rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, malaria and other tropical diseases. The tests have been used by the World Health Organization and others to combat recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika.

The company reported a loss of $4.7 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, compared with a loss of $4.4 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues totaled $25.8 million in the nine-month period, up from $18 million in 2017.

Chembio recently won $815,400 in tax breaks over 10 years from the Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency to consolidate the company's Medford and Holbrook operations into a single building in Hauppauge. Executives said the $3.9 million project will automate much of the production activity.

IDA records show that Chembio now employs 223 people in Suffolk and expects to have 201 in three years. The company also has a factory in Malaysia and offices in Germany.

NewsDay,A life-saving pill few actually use,"About 60 percent of U.S. deaths are caused by heart disease and cancer. If you were at risk for either, would you take a pill to lower your chances of getting sick? Would you be embarrassed to ask your provider about it? Would your provider make it harder to get the pill by requiring you go to a specialist, as opposed to prescribing it himself or herself?

Well, we have an HIV-prevention pill, yet only a fraction of people with ongoing risk of exposure to the virus have been prescribed it. The pill isn’t new. In fact, it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for more than six years.

Called Truvada, the medication is approved as a pre-exposure prophylaxis, also known as PrEP, among persons at risk for HIV infection. To be eligible for PrEP, one must be HIV-negative and at risk of acquiring HIV through sex or other behaviors like injecting drugs. The initial approval was only for adults; however, in 2018, the FDA approved Truvada for at-risk adolescents who weigh at least 77 pounds. Last year, the federal agency also approved a generic version of Truvada, but it is not expected to be released for another year or two.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about half of gay and bisexual black men and a quarter of gay and bisexual Latinos are at risk of contracting HIV in their lifetimes. In all, an estimated 1.2 million people could benefit from Truvada, yet only 90,000 PrEP prescriptions were filled in pharmacies in 2015, according to the CDC.

So, where’s the disconnect?

Among primary care providers, the barriers include limited knowledge about PrEP, discomfort talking about sexual health, concerns about insurance coverage and reimbursement, concerns about the efficacy of Truvada, long-term safety of PrEP, fear of judgment from their patients for assuming they may engage in high-risk behaviors, and the possibility that going on PrEP will encourage unprotected sex.

Gay and bisexual men and others who engage in risky behaviors cite stigma and discrimination from their providers, lack of knowledge about how PrEP works, fear of being judged by potential sex partners, and the burdens of quarterly provider checkups and simply remembering to take a pill every day.

Removing these barriers will require significant changes, including in our health care systems. Below are ways to address some of these barriers.

NewsDay,"AP-NORC Poll: Edit baby genes for health, not smarts","WASHINGTON — Most Americans say it would be OK to use gene-editing technology to create babies protected against a variety of diseases — but a new poll finds they'd draw the line at changing DNA so children are born smarter, faster or taller.

A month after startling claims of the births of the world's first gene-edited babies in China, the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds people are torn between the medical promise of a technology powerful enough to alter human heredity and concerns over whether it will be used ethically.

Jaron Keener, a 31-year-old exhibit designer at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Natural History, said he's opposed to ""rich people being able to create designer babies.""

But like the majority of Americans, Keener would support gene editing in embryos to prevent incurable diseases. His mother has lupus, an inflammatory disease that may have both environmental and genetic triggers.

Lupus has been ""a looming presence my entire life. I've been around somebody with a chronic illness and I've seen the toll that has taken, not just on her life, but the life of my family,"" he said.

Gene editing is like a biological cut-and-paste program, letting scientists snip out a section of DNA to delete, replace or repair a gene. Altering adult cells would affect only the patient being treated.

But editing genes in eggs, sperm or embryos would alter the resulting child in ways that can be passed to future generations — a step with such profound implications that international science guidelines say it shouldn't be tested in human pregnancies until more lab-based research determines it's safe to try.

The AP-NORC poll shows about 7 in 10 Americans favor one day using gene-editing technology to prevent an incurable or fatal disease a child otherwise would inherit, such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease.

Roughly two-thirds of Americans also favor using gene editing to prevent a child from inheriting a non-fatal condition such as blindness, and even to reduce the risk of diseases that might develop later in life, such as cancers.

Side effects are possible, such as a gene-editing attempt that accidentally alters the wrong DNA spot, and the poll finds 85 percent think that risk is at least somewhat likely.

But about 7 in 10 Americans oppose using gene editing to alter capabilities such as intelligence or athletic talent, and to alter physical features such as eye color or height.

The poll highlights that if gene editing of embryos ever moves into fertility clinics, there will be some hard choices about what non-fatal disorders should qualify, said Columbia University bioethicist Dr. Robert Klitzman. What if scientists could pinpoint genes involved with depression or autism or obesity — would they be OK to edit?

""It's one thing to look at the extremes of fatal diseases versus cosmetic things, but in the middle are going to be these very different issues,"" Klitzman said.

That reported gene editing in China was an attempt to create babies resistant to HIV infection, a target that many scientists in the U.S. and elsewhere decried because there are effective ways to prevent the AIDS virus.

The poll shows most people think it is at least somewhat likely that gene editing could wipe out certain inherited diseases and lead to other medical advances.

Yet despite the medical enthusiasm, more Americans oppose than favor government funding for testing on human embryos to develop gene-editing technology — 48 percent to 26 percent. About another quarter of the population takes no stand.

Without that research, how could gene editing ever become a choice for families hoping to avoid a disease?

""That's a good question,"" said Keener, the Pittsburgh museum worker, who opposes such funding for fear that research would lead to designer babies rather than fighting disease.

""If there would be a way to narrow the scope of research, I would be OK with government funding,"" he said. ""I just don't have a lot of confidence people wouldn't use it for their own gain.""

Indeed, the poll uncovers a lack of trust in science: About a third think this kind of gene editing will be used before it's adequately tested, as many scientists say happened in China. Nearly 9 in 10 people think the technology will be used for unethical reasons, including 52 percent who say this is very likely to happen.

And roughly three-quarters of Americans say gene editing probably wouldn't be affordable for the average person — raising the specter of certain genetic diseases becoming a problem only for the poor.

""People appear to realize there's a major question of how we should oversee and monitor use of this technology if and when it becomes available,"" said Columbia's Klitzman. ""What is safe enough? And who will determine that? The government? Or clinicians who say, 'Look, we did it in Country X a few times and it seems to be effective.'""

NewsDay,Health officials: Not too late to get a flu shot - or stay home if you're sick,"With flu season starting to peak, doctors on Long Island and across New York State are encouraging anyone still unvaccinated to roll up their sleeves for a shot.

Since the season started in October, 3,283 laboratory-confirmed cases of the flu have been reported statewide to the State Department of Health. One child died of the illness, and 923 people of all ages have been hospitalized, according to numbers compiled by the state from physicians and hospitals. The peak flu period runs from this month into February.

The majority of the cases, reported from New York City, have been caused by the dominant A-strain of influenza, called A/Singapore H3N2, which is one strain the flu shot protects against, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""It's not too late to get vaccinated,"" Dr. Susan Donelan, medical director of health care epidemiology and assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stony Brook University's Renaissance School of Medicine, wrote in an email.

Mary Ellen Laurain, a spokeswoman for the Nassau County Department of Health, urged residents 6 months of age and older to get their flu shot.

Donelan also advised anyone who isn’t feeling well to be mindful about possibly exposing others.

""Stay home if you are sick, regardless of whether you ‘think’ you may or may not have the flu,"" Donelan added in the email. ""There are a number of viruses out there circulating and any one of these may make someone else sick enough to be hospitalized, even if you are only mildly ill.""

Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases for the Northwell Health system, also stressed the importance of getting the vaccine, which if it doesn't completely prevent the illness, will modify its severity. The vaccine protects against four strains of influenza.

""I think the mistake many people make is that they think that if they get the flu after getting a flu shot that it was a failure,"" Farber said. ""But many times, although it didn't prevent it, it made the flu less severe and can prevent hospitalization or complications.""

Health officials underscore that state figures are lower than the actual number of flu cases because most people do not seek medical attention.

Other seasonal respiratory viruses in circulation include respiratory syncytial virus — RSV — coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, human meta-pneumovirus and parainfluenza virus, which despite its name, does not cause the flu.

The flu remains an ongoing health concern not only because of its contagiousness, but also because of its capacity to morph into pneumonia, which can be deadly.

Unvaccinated health care workers must wear ""surgical"" or ""procedure"" masks in the presence of patients, according to a state law in effect since the 2013-14 flu season.

“Health care personnel are routinely exposed to sick patients and are also in close contact with vulnerable patients,” State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement. “The requirement that unvaccinated health care personnel wear a mask when patients are nearby protects both our critical health care workforce and at-risk New Yorkers.""

An estimated 80,000 people died nationwide during the 2017-18 flu season, a total that included 200 children, according to the CDC. It was the highest flu-death toll in 40 years.

The high number of deaths arrived in the 100th anniversary year of the 1918 flu, the worst flu season in human history. An estimated 675,000 people died in the United States and 50 million worldwide. Within months, the pandemic killed more people than any other infectious illness in recorded history.

Simple measures can help limit influenza's spread.

""Cover your coughs and sneezes,"" Donelan said, ""and perform hand-hygiene with either soap and water or alcohol-based hand rubs after blowing your nose. Avoid touching mucous membranes such as your eyes, nose and mouth.""",26/12/2018
NewsDay,My Pet World Q&A,"Q I found a cat on the street with a collar, but no tag. I fed her and took her to my vet's office to check for a microchip. Since no microchip was found, I had her blood checked for HIV, etc. and her teeth cleaned before I brought her home. The bill was $450.

This kitty, apparently, was left on the streets; there were no lost signs in the neighborhood. After 14 days, however, I spotted a sign. So, do I give the cat back to people so ill-informed that they didn't even look for her for days, failed to tag or chip her, and clearly left her outside in a heavy traffic area? The sign said that ""she did not come home one night."" Do I keep her? At this point, I feel I should keep her.

I belong to several animal organizations and am an activist. I can't count the number of pets that I have rescued or picked up off the street. I can't imagine anyone so ignorant that they let a cat run loose in this day and age. Also, do you have any tips on getting her accustomed to indoor life? She wants to go out, but so far, I have been keeping her busy and in a backroom if I leave any door open to the outside.

— B. Anne, via email

A It's wonderful you rescued this cat and got her checked for a microchip. That is the exact right first step for anyone finding a lost pet.

The second step is to let your neighbors know you found a lost pet. Did you put up signs around the neighborhood to say you had found her? Did you report her as ""found"" through the city shelter or humane society?

It's hard to know why the family didn't get signs up sooner, and easy to jump to conclusions when we don't know the entire story. Regardless of when they put the signs up (they may have posted on social media or called the animal shelter first), if they took the time to make signs and put them up around the neighborhood, one has to assume they love their cat and want her back.

While I'm an advocate for keeping cats indoors, I don't judge people too harshly for letting let their cats outside at night since it was once a common practice that many people grew up thinking it was OK to do. It takes time to educate people about the safety of keeping cats indoors, but this practice, in general, doesn't mean they are bad cat owners.

While ID tags and microchips are also the hallmarks of a responsible pet owner, not having them doesn't mean the person doesn't love their pet. What it often means is that they either don't understand the importance of ID'ing their pets or don't have the resources to pay for a microchip. With their cat now missing, it's possible they may regret not providing proper ID.

As you are now seeing, some cats are very persistent about wanting to go outside. As a result, some cat owners give in to this pressure and let their cats outside at night. I am not saying this is right, but some people still think it's OK to do.

So, my question to you is, what would you want someone to do if the situation was reversed and it was your kitty that didn't come home one night? Would you hope and pray someone would call you about your cat? I know you already love this cat and have invested money into her welfare too, but if your answer is yes, you would want someone to call you, then I think you know what you have to do.

Q Here is another tip for the Christmas tree. I put the tree and gifts in a corner and surround them with an X-Pen. I can enjoy the lights and holiday colors, and the curious hounds can't get into mischief.

— Sharon, via email

NewsDay,Public health should be as reliable as our highways,"Check your morning news and you are likely to read distressing stories about the threat of a bad flu season, the consequences of natural disasters like wildfires in California, unacceptably high maternal and infant death rates, or the opioid epidemic.

All these emerging challenges occur on top of our nation’s chronic public health issues, like heart disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS, which continue to take a toll on the length and quality of life for people in the United States. This also takes a toll on the health and vitality of our communities and comes at great cost to our federal and state health care budgets.

As we face these challenges, we turn to local public health agencies to protect us: by addressing policy solutions and building the multisector collaborations it takes to lead a community response.

A public health system with foundational capabilities is one with the ability to track the health of a community through data, case findings, and lab tests; the capacity to respond to emergencies of all kinds; the experience to translate public health science into appropriate policy and regulation; the adeptness to communicate effectively with the public with timely, science-based information; and the power to harness and align community resources and actors to advance the health of the entire community.

The American people should rightly expect that where you live should not determine your level of public health protection — but current data tell us it does. Only 51 percent of the U.S. population is served by a comprehensive public health system.

Because daily public health demands and emergent challenges like epidemics and natural disasters do not recognize state or city boundaries, America should be protected by a strong public health infrastructure. Health protection should not depend on local decisions or stop abruptly at political borders. Instead, it should be more reliable, like the interstate highways. Foundational public health capabilities should be part of our nation’s infrastructure.

Organized around this common-sense notion that all people in America deserve public health protection, the Public Health Leadership Forum, a project of RESOLVE, with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, brought together a panel of experts to inform recommendations on how we might commit to building our nation’s public health infrastructure.

Using a national study conducted by the University of Kentucky, the panel found that supporting foundational public health capabilities across the country would cost an estimated $9.5 billion a year.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

That sounds like a lot of money, but it comes to only $32 per person per year. Compare that to the estimated $11,193 per person we spend on health care, and it is a great return on investment.

Indeed, total spending for foundational public health capabilities is less than one-fourteenth of the increase in per capita health care spending in the last year.

Based on current investments by all levels of government, the University of Kentucky estimated there is a $4.5 billion gap between what is now in place and what is needed to achieve a truly nationwide public health infrastructure.

To close this gap, we recommend creating a Public Health Infrastructure Fund. This recommendation is part of a new white paper we are releasing this week during an event at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The paper calls for investing $4.5 billion annually in establishing and sustaining foundational public health capabilities.

It also identifies key principles that would guide the Public Health Infrastructure Fund, including:

All people in America should be served by a public health agency that ensures equitable access to and protection by foundational public health capabilities.

Financing of foundational capabilities is a governmental responsibility and should be assured through sustainable, dedicated revenue streams. Local, state, and federal governments should share in financing those capabilities as all levels of government ultimately benefit from them.

Foundational public health capabilities should be assessed and provided in every community based on national standards — and maintaining those standards should be a condition of continued funding.

We recommend that this Public Health Infrastructure Fund should be a mandatory funding stream, awarded through the states to state and local health departments on a per capita basis. The fund would have a 10 percent state matching requirement, with a set aside for technical assistance, research, and demonstration project.

As a new Congress is seated next month, there is no doubt that rebuilding our nation’s overall infrastructure as well as taking on the new (and old) threats to our nation’s health and prosperity will be high on its agenda. We hope Congress will also see investment in a Public Health Infrastructure Fund as a critical step to assuring all people in America have the public health protection they should expect and deserve.

NewsDay,Gene editing is here. It's an enormous threat.,"A Chinese scientist's claim to have created the first genetically edited babies has evoked widespread condemnation from the scientific community. ""This is far too premature,"" one American genetic scientist told the Associated Press.

But here is a larger question: Should we be doing this at all?

The Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, used a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to alter the DNA of two children in a petri dish and attempt to make them resistant to HIV. This is not what has American scientists up at arms. In fact, researchers in the United States have done the same thing. In 2017, scientists at Oregon Health & Science University used CRISPR to genetically alter human embryos to make them resistant to an unidentified disease. The difference is that He then implanted his edited embryos. The American researchers killed theirs.

The prospect of genetically eliminating crippling diseases is certainly appealing, but this promise masks a darker reality. First, there is a difference between genetic engineering and the extremely promising field of gene therapy, in which doctors use CRISPR technology to repair the DNA of defective nonreproductive cells -- allowing them to treat cancer, genetic disorders and other diseases. In gene therapy, the genetic changes affect only the patient. In genetic engineering, scientists alter the entire genetic structure of the resulting human being -- changes that are then passed on to future generations.

Playing with humanity's genetic code could open a Pandora's box. Scientists will eventually be able to alter DNA not just to protect against disease but also to create genetically enhanced human beings. The same techniques that can eliminate muscular dystrophy might also be used to enhance muscles to improve strength or speed. Techniques used to eliminate dementia may also be harnessed to enhance memory and cognition. This would have profound societal implications.

Only the wealthy would be able to afford made-to-order babies. This means the privileged few would be able to eliminate imperfections and improve the talent, beauty, stature and IQ of their offspring -- thus locking in their privilege for generations. Those at the bottom would not. This could be a death blow to the American Dream, the idea that anyone who is willing to work hard in this country can rise up the economic ladder. Indeed, genetic engineering could actually eliminate opportunities for those at the bottom. For example, one path to higher education for those at the bottom is scholarships for athletic or artistic talents. But in a world of genetic engineering, those scholarships will disappear for the unenhanced poor -- and with them the opportunities to improve their economic prospects in life. Think inequality is bad today? Wait to see what it looks like in the genetically modified future.

If we begin to create perfect children in labs, over time society will begin develop an intolerance for imperfection. If your children have an illness because you didn't genetically eliminate it, or if they can't keep up because of their unenhanced cognitive abilities, then that makes them an unjust burden on the rest of us. As we are separated into the enhanced and unenhanced, respect for the dignity of every human life will be diminished. So will personal responsibility. If we don't make it in life because we are unenhanced, it's not our fault. And if we do because we are enhanced, we don't get the credit. As Harvard University professor Michael Sandel once wrote, ""It is one thing to hit seventy home runs as the result of disciplined training and effort, and something else, something less, to hit them with the help of … genetically enhanced muscles."" Genetic engineering could rob Americans of the obligation, and the joy, of earning their own success.

Then there is the threat to women's equality. If genetic engineering can offer the promise of eliminating disease, it will also allow parents to choose the sex of their child. That could lead to greater sex discrimination. Just look at China, where the one-child policy led to mass infanticide of girls. If you believe that gender bias exists, then that bias will be expressed through genetic engineering -- with potentially disastrous implications.

It will also lead to an explosion in the number of discarded children. For every child born via in vitro fertilization, there are multiple fetuses which are created but never used. Today, the Department of Health and Human Services reports, there are more than 600,000 cryogenically frozen embryos in the United States. If genetic engineering through in vitro fertilization becomes common, that number will skyrocket, sparking a profound moral crisis.

Here is the bottom line: We should not be playing God. Genetic research holds the promise to prevent, cure and even eliminate disease. But when it is used to create made-to-order ""super children,"" we have crossed a moral line from which there may be no return.

NewsDay,Mum's the word about Scrabble adding 300 words to its dictionary,"Here is a news update that I hope slips by unnoticed.

Keepers of the Scrabble dictionary have added 300 words.

“OK,” for instance, is at long last . . . ok. “Bizjet” shows up, a nod to corporate travelers with bankrolls big enough to count as extra luggage. “Macaron,” the fancy French cookie with a name like the country’s leader —Emmanuel Macron — is suddenly tres bon, too.

Outliers like “sheeple,” “wayback,” “twerk,” “zomboid,” “puggle” and “nubber” are also among the newly acceptable.

If it were up to me, the latter two would be kept on permanent reserve for the naming of Bassett hounds or twin boys born under a forest toadstool. Stop playing with the frogs and wombats, Puggle and Nubber, and come back to the enchanted cottage for dinner. Now!

Summoning particular good cheer in this holiday season is addition of the word “qapik” — the currency of Azerbaijan — which may enable the player stuck with a “q” but no “u” to mount a late-game rally that exasperates his Christmas Eve opponent to the extent she does not recover until January or beyond.

Why be coy?

I mention “the player” and his opponent — “she” — because that would be me and my elder daughter, who we will call only K.

K. as in Kombat.

Listen, like most parents, I lean toward mercifulness when it comes to my children.

I opposed corporal punishment when the four were tykes — oh, all right, a gentle disciplinary pinch might have been occasionally inflicted — and did not favor dunce caps or dark closets.

So far as I can recall, I screamed only once when, as a teenager, our youngest, a boy, customized several parked vehicles with our family Honda Civic twice on the same snowy evening. Showing enormous restraint, I did not banish him to the basement or boarding school in Grenada.

All things considered, then, I am indulgent. At Scrabble, I draw the line.

K. and I have been playing a smartphone version of Scrabble — our choice is Words with Friends — for several years.

We compete in sets of 20 games. The contests are hard fought. She plays “zap,” I play, “shah.” She tries “toques.” I spell “etude.” She: “nave.” Me: “pagan.” K. floats “ceded.” I’m back with “axel.” Recently, I high-fived myself after “tsunami” only to be humbled by K.’s obscure but cleverly placed and higher scoring “dentin.”

Hard-fought, yes, as I say, but, sadly, for me, to no avail. In all our 20-game series, I have won not once. I come close, yes I do. Final tallies put me within striking distance (20-17, 20-18, etc.) but I cannot close the deal.

Worse, K., a lovely person, no question, but with a pronounced competitive spirit, appears to consider her father not sufficiently vanquished.

“I can’t believe I’m losing to you,” she once said after I staged a magnificent final surge to snatch a single game victory.

“Can’t believe?” Really? Why the surprise?

Am I not the father who worked since around the time of Gutenberg as a newspaper reporter, toiling daily at what some wry practitioners call the “paragraph factory”? Words ‘r’ Us, for better or worse. Where is the respect?

My hunch is that K., a mental health professional, was more indulging in psy-ops than any attempt to dismiss me as Zen master. Outwardly civilized and contemplative, Scrabble is not for the meek. Into battle go the bold and brave.

Even my mother, Winnie, everyone’s sweetheart, was a tough customer when tiles tumbled from the pouch.

In Brooklyn, we would sit across from one another, the board on a kind of turntable.

Mom never went beyond high school but was a serious reader with vocabulary to match. Contests were respectful but no-nonsense affairs.

“C’mon,” ordered Mom when the last grain in our little sand timer ran out. “Make a move.”

Or: “Xyruk is not a word. We’ve discussed this before. Lose your turn.”

And: “My, my. Look at that. Triple letter and triple word. Write me down for 66.”

Turn after turn. Hours on end. Mostly, I lost.

Our four kids loved their Granny, and K. has plenty of her genes — in life and in Scrabble. I hope I have a few, too.

That’s why I’ve made up my mind. Mom was generous, kind and selfless — but all business at the Scrabble board. Those 300 new words? “Bokeh,” “botnet,” “facepalm,” “hivemind”? I’m studying hard but keeping quiet: K. is on her own.",06/12/2018
NewsDay,Mandate HIV testing for collegians,"We have easy access to screening and diagnostic tests that can help eradicate one of the most widespread viruses of our time, HIV, yet we fail to use them. As a result, the rates of this disease are still at epidemic levels. I know this story all too well as an HIV researcher for the past 15 years.

This year, World AIDS Day on Dec. 1 marked its 30th anniversary with a renewed call to know your status. Your health and your life could depend on it.

We have effective ways of preventing HIV: testing, prevention pills (pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, and post-exposure prophylaxis, PEP), using condoms and clean needles, behavioral change interventions and addressing social determinants of health.

While the rates of undiagnosed HIV infection across New York have improved since the introduction of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s “Blueprint on Ending the AIDS Epidemic,” the state Department of Health says there are about 9,000 New Yorkers with HIV who don’t know their status. While all health care providers in New York State are required to routinely offer an HIV test to everyone 13 and older, many don’t. And many who need the test refuse it.

Patients who refuse often cite cost, low perceived risk and fear of stigmatization. Physicians, meanwhile, say competing clinical priorities, time constraints, a complicated consent process, lack of training on testing technology, and inadequate reimbursement are major reasons for not offering the test. To address these issues, the New York State Department of Health recently launched “Expect the Test,” a campaign to remove some barriers to HIV testing and raise awareness that state public health law requires all health care providers to offer the test.

What can the higher education community do? I propose mandatory HIV testing for all students entering college. The American College Health Association already recommends immunization and vaccination requirements for college students and encourages colleges to screen for tuberculosis.

I understand the complexities associated with scaling up population-based services. They include privacy, confidentiality, counseling and consent issues. And I realize that mandatory testing of college students is a controversial idea that might never happen. But I also know that we aren’t going to end the epidemic unless we change testing attitudes. So, let’s at least start talking about a bolder approach to the issue.

Mandatory testing also might help reduce HIV stigma because it would become a routine part of care needed to protect students and the larger campus community. More important, it would help meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline that everyone between 13 and 64 years old get tested for HIV at least once. Moreover, this type of initiative would address one goal of the state blueprint — to identify people with HIV who remain undiagnosed and link them to health care.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Requiring students to be tested could make a meaningful dent in the high rates of undiagnosed HIV among youth. In 2016, the CDC reported youth ages 13 to 24 comprised 21 percent of all new HIV diagnoses. Moreover, only 56 percent of HIV-infected youth in the United States are aware of their condition. Unfortunately, many young people get tested only after becoming sick.

People living with HIV have access to safe, effective treatments (including a pill a day), with few side effects. Let’s give everyone this chance to live a long, fulfilling life by expanding HIV testing efforts and raising awareness about the importance of knowing one’s status.

New York was the first state to develop a formal, centralized program in response to the epidemic. We should be first with other trailblazing and forward-thinking public health initiatives as well. I urge you to get tested. To find an HIV testing location near you visit locator.hiv.gov.

NewsDay,"At 25, LGBT Network supports, inspires next generation on Long Island","In June of this year, a rainbow flag raised at Hempstead Town Hall ushered in Pride on the Beach, a three-day festival that would bring thousands to Long Beach to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Such a gathering would have been unthinkable to most, if not all, members of the local LGBT community 27 years ago, when Long Island’s first gay pride parade stepped off in Huntington only after a hearing in federal court to obtain the permit.

Though this reality — one that includes federal marriage equality for same-sex couples — may be a given among millennials and Gen Z, its foundation has been painstakingly built by the previous generation. On Long Island, that generation has included David Kilmnick, 51, whose LGBT Network and its first major initiative, Long Island Gay and Lesbian Youth, in 2018 celebrated 25 years of service.

The network has been a lifeline for Zachary Reyes, 21, of Huntington Station, who spoke in November at the group’s Transgender Day of Remembrance in Bay Shore. TDOR events, which got their start in 1999 in San Francisco, memorialize those who have died because of anti-transgender violence.

“LIGALY has been a place of welcome, a place of love, and a place of community for LGBT people,” Reyes said. “Without LIGALY I don’t know where I’d be.”

The network helped Reyes come out twice: first as a gay teen around age 13, then as a transgender person three years ago. Reyes, who's been accepted at Dutchess Community College in Poughkeepsie, works in retail stores at the Walt Whitman Shops.

“I don’t identify as any gender,” Reyes explained, asking to be referred to by the pronouns “they” and “them,” rather than “he/she” or “him/her.”

“My entire family, my Mom included, already knew that I was gay, but they did have a little bit of trouble with me coming out as transgender. LIGALY helped me to talk to my mom about what I was experiencing,” Reyes said, adding that their mom is “still grappling"" with their gender identity.

Reyes recalled being bullied and plagued by thoughts of suicide while in middle school. In 10th grade at Walt Whitman High School, however, Reyes met a LIGALY coordinator in a classroom presentation. LIGALY staff helped by drawing up a life plan, they said. Reyes visits the LGBT Network three times a week and volunteers as a trainer for programs that help other LGBT youths “come out” about their orientation.

LIGALY invites kids 13 to 21 to hang out with other LGBT youths at Friday “OUTlet” social events. Same-sex dates can be taken each June to the annual LGBT Prom, which drew more than 300 teens this year.

“So many gay kids feel that they can’t do what they want because of who they love,” said Kilmnick, of Centereach.

But at the centers, in Woodbury, Bay Shore, Sag Harbor and Long Island City, Queens, they soon learn that “there’s nothing more freeing than to be yourself,” Kilmnick said on a recent afternoon at the network’s Woodbury offices.

Kilmnick, a genial man with piercing blue eyes, took a visitor on a tour of office hallways decorated with “Coming Out Day” posters designed by Long Island youngsters and news clippings of major events in the organization’s history. The tour ended in a meeting room where photos of LIGALY alumni hang next to a full-size rainbow flag.

“These kids were all able to express themselves, to use their talents and be leaders, and they’ve gone on to pursue their dreams, comfortable in their own skin,” Kilmnick said. “They were allowed to be their authentic selves and enjoy life despite the challenges in society.”

In the past quarter-century much has changed for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people on Long Island — and in the nation. Indeed, in 2017 the Pew Research Center reported, “Two years after the Supreme Court decision that required states to recognize same-sex marriages nationwide, support for allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally is at its highest point in over 20 years of Pew Research Center polling on the issue.” The research center found that by a margin of nearly 2 to 1, more Americans say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry.

Marriage equality has afforded dignity and legal rights to same-sex couples, who can now walk into any municipal office and obtain a marriage license. Kilmnick and the LGBT Network have often been on the front lines of such battles, promoting acceptance, anti-bullying programs in schools and HIV-prevention education.

Largest in the region

Kilmnick said that with its recent expansion into Queens, his organization is now “the largest regional network of regional LGBT services in New York State in terms of geography and population served.”

Local LGBT activists credit the centers with providing a safe space, especially for people without other healthy social outlets.

“I feel strongly that these community centers are really lifesaving,” said Nicole Grodner, 36, of Bethpage, a union representative, who has visited the Bay Shore center and attends the LGBT Network-sponsored Pride on the Beach with her partner of 13 years.

""For people who feel like they don’t belong anywhere, that open door gives them a place where they can feel comfortable and a part of something,” Grodner said.

“The work that he’s doing is really important,” agreed Maura Spery, 59, of Mastic Beach, who moved to Long Island in 2002 with her partner, Nancy Sorkow, 60, a social worker.

As a sign of progress, Spery said, her sexual orientation wasn’t an issue in 2014, when she won an election for Mastic Beach village trustee. She went on to be elected mayor in 2015, serving until the village was absorbed last year by Brookhaven township.

But LGBT Long Islanders also acknowledge the challenges likely ahead, especially for transgender people, many of whom worry their rights may be endangered by changing federal policies.

Gregory Noone, 56, of Ronkonkoma, a former Long Island ACT UP activist who has participated in network programs, said the community needs to be wary of complacency. “The biggest challenge is we should not take things for granted,” said Noone, program manager for Thursday’s Child, a Patchogue-based nonprofit serving people living with HIV and AIDS.

“We live in a little bubble here on Long Island,"" said Noone, who married James Gale, 55, a bank manager, in 2006 in Toronto. ""Even though we have marriage equality, it can be changed. A good chunk of the country thinks it’s OK to allow people to be fired just because they’re gay. It’s [discrimination] still legal in more than half of the states.”

Same-sex marriage was practically unimaginable, and LGBT life vastly different, when Kilmnick was growing up in Far Rockaway, Queens.

“I knew I was gay as far back as I can remember,” Kilmnick said. “When I was 5 or 6, when people were talking about being attracted to the opposite sex, I knew I was attracted to the same sex — but I knew enough not to talk about it.”

Kilmnick learned about community organizing from his grandmother Helen Leonescu, a Democratic leader in Far Rockaway with whom his family shared a two-family house.

Kilmnick graduated from Far Rockaway High School in 1984 and earned a bachelor’s degree in public relations from LIU Post in Brookville, where he was elected student body president.

How it started

The idea for LIGALY grew out of a project to complete a master’s degree in social work at Stony Brook University. “I decided to create a curriculum to talk about what it was like to grow up gay, particularly in the suburbs in an isolated area like Long Island,” Kilmnick said.

For his research, Kilmnick contacted area schools and asked to make a presentation. Some districts said they had no LGBT students. But a few accepted, leading Kilmnick to believe he was on the right track.

“No matter where I did this workshop, a couple of students would straggle behind, shuffle their papers and ask a question: Is there any place I can go to meet other people like myself?”

LIGALY started with a half-dozen school districts, including East Hampton and Uniondale. Nowadays, Kilmnick said, the LGBT Network provides workshops or speakers in 110 of Long Island’s 125 public school districts, reaching tens of thousands of students a year. About 4,000 youths currently attend LGBT Center programs.

In 2006, the organization expanded to include “life-span” services for the LGBT community, Kilmnick said. A newer program is SAGE-LI, a social group for older adults. The network also continues to expand its educational programs, which include transgender awareness among about two dozen workshops offered to youth student leaders, Nassau and Suffolk police academies and other audiences.

The network has also been credited with a number of firsts: the Gay Parent Teacher Student Association it launched in 2012, and a Major League team Pride Night with the New York Mets in 2015.

With 50 staff members, the LGBT Network has a $5.6-million annual budget, about two thirds funded by state and local government grants. The balance comes from fundraisers.

Among LIGALY alumni, James Quinn credits the group with saving his life.

“If it wasn’t for LIGALY, I don’t think I’d be alive today,” said Quinn, a Northport High School graduate who was 14 when he showed up at a LIGALY meeting, feeling alone and isolated.

“It [LIGALY] showed me that I wasn’t alone and that there wasn’t anything wrong with me, that I was perfectly normal and there were other kids just like me,” said the East Northport native who is the owner of an event production company in Washington, D.C., and an associate producer of this year’s March for Our Lives, the student-led demonstrations in support of tightening gun control.

Quinn, 31, who moved off Long Island in 2005 to attend college, has kept in touch with Kilmnick and the LGBT Network. Six years ago, when he was working in the Obama administration’s Office of Scheduling and Advance, Quinn arranged for Vice President Joe Biden to send a copy of “The White House Cookbook,” with a handwritten note, as a wedding gift when Kilmnick married his life partner, Robert Vitelli, in 2012 at Land’s End catering hall in Sayville.

“I wish you the very best and I am proud to stand with both of you,” says the note Kilmnick has kept as a memento.

Biden didn’t attend the wedding, which was held the same weekend as the Democratic National Convention where he was nominated for a second term. But the vice presidential acknowledgment attests to Kilmnick as a rising national LGBT figure. Kilmnick went on to serve on Hillary Clinton’s statewide leadership committee during her 2016 presidential campaign.

In addition to working to improve LGBT life in the “now,” Kilmnick lists priorities for the next several years: opening five new LGBT centers on Long Island by 2020; building affordable housing for LGBT seniors, people living with HIV and/or AIDS and homeless youth; and training LGBT youths to enter the workforce.

“Everyone should feel free to come out and be themselves,” Kilmnick adds. “When it comes down to social justice and civil rights, equality needs to be afforded to all.”

For Reyes, the network and LIGALY have been both a support and an inspiration. LIGALY helps trans people “to keep living as we are without anyone telling us what or who to be,” Reyes said, adding, “I’m happy to have a platform to speak on these issues and preach love to anyone who’s going to hear me.”",29/11/2018
NewsDay,Northwell to offer free HIV testing using mobile van at CVS locations,"New Hyde Park-based Northwell Health on Thursday said it has launched a pilot program to increase access to HIV testing and promote prevention efforts in Long Island and Queens communities where the virus is highly prevalent.

Clinicians and outreach workers from Northwell’s Center for AIDS Research and Treatment (CART) at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset are collaborating with CVS Health to provide free, onsite HIV testing via Northwell’s mobile health van parked at select CVS Pharmacy locations throughout the area.

The effort will launch at the CVS Pharmacy in West Hempstead, located at 814 W. Hempstead Ave., and is slated to start the third week of December. The mobile health van will visit other CVS Pharmacy locations during the first quarter of 2019.

As part of prevention efforts, CART staff will provide educational training to CVS staff and pharmacists about various aspects of HIV testing and screening.

In addition to this pilot program, CVS Health has donated 500 HIV in-home test kits, which allow people to perform an oral swab privately. Northwell plans to distribute the home testing kits at venues such as nightclubs to individuals who may be at risk for the virus and are reluctant to walk into a health van to be tested.

This initiative is being announced ahead of the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, with the goal of providing health resources and education for people living in high-risk communities.

There were 129,000 people living with HIV in New York State as of 2015, according to AIDSVu, an organization that tracks HIV and AIDS stats nationwide.

For more information about the schedule and location for Northwell’s mobile health van, call CART at 516-713-8060.

NewsDay,"Tasting honey wine at Long Island's newest meadery, W A Meadwerks in Lindenhurst","When it comes to fermented drinks, beer and wine command the most attention, and mead tends to be the forgotten little sister.

The beverage that results from fermenting honey and water together, however, has a leg up on both in terms of longevity: Allegedly some of the earliest forebears found an abandoned hive filled with rainwater, possibly in ancient Egypt, and the fermented result turned humans on to the joys of alcohol.

At W A Meadwerks, which opened in Lindenhurst earlier this fall, the fermentation process is decidedly more controlled: Owners Joseph Abruzzo Jr. and Roger Wanner blend honey with filtered water in a spotless room lined with fermentation tanks and a carbonator. In three weeks or so, their meads — flavored with blueberries, or vanilla, or even hops — are ready to be kegged, canned and bottled.

Abruzzo and Wanner are both longtime mead hobbyists who funded their meadery, in part, with an Indiegogo campaign, which helped build a funky, chilled-out tasting room. Anyone who has been put off by oversweet meads at some point may have a change of heart (and palate) here: Mostly sparkling, these honey wines can have ample dryness and tannins to balance out their sweeter notes. On a recent Friday night, the lineup included a dry-hopped mead (an IPM); a breezy version flavored with peaches; a pineapple and vanilla-laced mead called If You Like Mead-A-Colada, as well as jewel-tone meads flavored with berries and cherries. A sampler of five costs $7; a 13-ounce pour is $7; and cans are available to go.

At the end of November, Wanner and Abruzzo will release their first barrel-aged mead, a version flavored with orange zest, cherries and orange-blossom honey and then left to rest in a former rye barrel. (This mead, mentioned in last week’s column on Thanksgiving drinks, is intended as a ringer for an Old Fashioned cocktail).

In terms of pacing, mead’s alcohol content falls in the range of beer and cider (about 6 to 7 percent), but can hit a whopping 14 percent. That boozy version, the berry-forward Three’s Company, comes in slender bottles that can slip easily into a stocking.

W A Meadwerks, 26 W. Hoffman Ave., Lindenhurst; 516-607-5664. Open Friday 3 to 9 p.m., Saturday and Sunday noon to 8 p.m.",21/11/2018
NewsDay,Chembio seeks tax breaks as it uses robots to cut its workforce,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. is seeking tax breaks for a consolidation of its Suffolk County operations that will reduce its workforce as it uses more robots to do production work, officials said Thursday.

The manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika, malaria and other diseases is proposing to move its office, research lab, factory and warehouse to 555 Wireless Blvd. in Hauppauge. Most of the operations are now in Medford, with the warehouse in Holbrook, according to records.

As part of the $3.9 million move, Chembio said it plans to replace 45 production jobs with robots and hire 23 new workers in higher-paying research and development, engineering and finance jobs.

The company's total workforce would fall from 223 in the county to 201, but the average pay would climb to $60,460, a gain of $7,370, records show. It's unusual for an employer to receive tax breaks when it's laying off workers.

“Consolidating our manufacturing, warehousing and personnel into a single facility is required to maintain competitiveness in our industry,” said Neil A. Goldman, Chembio’s chief financial officer, adding employees now have to walk outside to get from building to building.

The company would rent the Hauppauge space, which would increase its square footage to 70,000 from 60,000.

On Thursday the county's Industrial Development Agency voted unanimously to offer Chembio an incentive package valued at $815,400, including a reduction in property taxes on the Hauppauge building of $530,518 over 10 years.

IDA executive director Anthony J. Catapano acknowledged the company is cutting the ranks of its hourly employees from 163 to 118. But he said the number of higher-paid employees is increasing from 57 to 80.

""Although there will be fewer production employees, there will be more salaried jobs, and the payroll will grow by $300,000 per year,"" he said in an interview.

Earlier this year the company installed robots on one of its local production lines. Executives have said they are responding to higher payroll costs stemming from a rise in New York State's minimum wage.

Chembio reported a loss of $6.4 million last year on sales of $24 million. The company last reported an annual profit in 2013.

Chembio shares closed up 3 cents to $5.81 on Thursday. A year ago the shares were trading at $6.75.

Besides the United States, Chembio has a factory in Malaysia and recently purchased a developer of test-results readers in Germany.

""Their primary objective is to stay in Suffolk County,"" David G. Hunt, the company's real estate consultant, told the IDA board on Thursday. ""The production lines will ultimately be fully automated.""",15/11/2018
NewsDay,Chembio's Ebola test wins FDA approval for emergency use,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has won approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration for emergency use of its Ebola test, officials said.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Zika and other diseases said its blood test for Ebola is “authorized for presumptive detection in individuals with signs and symptoms.”

Ebola was first discovered in 1976 in the Congo and is often fatal. The illness is characterized by fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. An outbreak in 2014-16 in West Africa was the worst in history, according to the World Health Organization.

“We believe [the test] will be a valuable tool to address the global threat posed by Ebola virus, including the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said last week. “We hope to receive support and funding as we pursue additional regulatory approvals for our rapid Ebola test.”

NewsDay,We can prevent mass shootings. Here’s how,"Yes, again.

In another it-can’t-happen-here community, a young man has taken the lives of many others, and then his own.

Elements of the story in Thousand Oaks are all too familiar. He was known to his neighbors and law enforcement to be deeply troubled. He was not prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms, though he had been evaluated earlier this year for the possibility of severe mental illness. He had a high-capacity ammunition magazine.

Familiar, yes, but it should not be the new normal.

We can prevent mass shootings. Adequate background checks can stop many high-risk persons from buying firearms, whether that risk is a prior history of violent crime, substance abuse or severe mental illness. Extending the prohibition on gun purchases to include misdemeanors such as assault and battery makes a clear difference.

Unfortunately, many background checks are inadequate. Information is not reported or is mishandled; legal ambiguities can make it difficult to know whether events are, in fact, prohibiting. And even where background checks are required, many people avoid them.

There is much work to do here. Programs such as California’s Armed and Prohibited Persons System can recover firearms from persons who purchased them legally, but then became prohibited from owning them. APPS has retrieved thousands of firearms without serious incident. Our group of researchers is evaluating its effect on risk for future violence.

Perhaps most relevant to the tragedy in Thousand Oaks are gun violence restraining orders. These court orders allow firearms to be temporarily seized from individuals in crisis. Thirteen states have enacted such policies, including eight just this year.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Among them is “pro-gun” Florida, scene of the Parkland school shooting. I am aware of two potential mass shootings in California that did not occur because these restraining orders prevented would-be shooters from acquiring firearms. These policies have great potential and should be more widely adopted, and they should be much better known in states where they exist.

There have been other hopeful developments. Physicians and other health professionals, with strong encouragement from many of their professional associations, are stepping up and making public commitments to discuss firearms with their patients, to offer counsel on how to store guns safely and to help authorities recover firearms in emergencies.

Because of mass shootings, we all have a personal stake in preventing firearm violence. Our children and our grandchildren are all at risk. Each of us must also understand that we might be the one person who, having seen something, says something.

And we must remember that our elected officials depend on us to guide them. It is our job to let them know that action to prevent firearm violence is on the must-do list.

America has a proud tradition of mobilizing in the face of crises that threaten public health and safety. We put smart people on the case to do scientific research, so that we can understand the crisis and the clearest paths to solutions. We tell our policymakers to implement those solutions, and we follow through to make sure that progress is made.

We have done this for motor vehicle deaths, heart disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS. We can do it for gun violence.

But really, “we” means you. If you haven’t already, make your own public commitment to do your part - whatever that means to you - to help protect our shared right to live safely.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics quarterly loss widens to $2.3M,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. reported a wider loss for the July-September period compared with a year earlier as profit margins on rapid tests for HIV and other diseases were squeezed in some markets, executives said Thursday.

The Medford-based manufacturer lost $2.3 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $600,000 in the same period in 2017.

Revenue in the quarter totaled $9.4 million, an increase of 24 percent year over year.

Executives, in an earnings announcement, said the gross profit margin on sales of tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika and other illnesses fell 48 percent in July-September to $1.1 million compared with the 2017 period because of production costs and “sales growth in markets with lower average selling prices.”

CEO John J. Sperzel said the company received $16.6 million in net proceeds from its recent stock offering and used about $5 million to purchase opTricon GmbH, a German developer of test results readers.

“We are especially pleased to have completed the first regulatory submission for our DPP test to identify an undisclosed biomarker, developed through our collaboration with AstraZeneca,” the pharmaceutical giant, Sperzel said.

In January, Chembio announced a research collaboration with AstraZeneca to create a test that detects a biomarker or substance that shows a disease or infection is present in the body. Chembio said at the time that it would receive up to $2.9 million from AstraZeneca, the Cambridge, England-based seller of the acid reflux medicine Nexium and other drugs, for the new test.

On Monday, Oct. 22, the Medford diagnostics company said it had begun the stock offering, but halted it last Thursday, a day after a more than 600-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

In Wednesday's news release, Chembio, a maker of rapid test results for HIV, syphilis, Zika, Ebola and other diseases, said it plans to use the proceeds from the stock offering to fund its $5.5 million cash acquisition of Berlin-based opTricon GmbH.

OpTricon makes handheld test result readers of blood and saliva samples.

Chembio said it also would use the stock-sale proceeds to fund growth initiatives and for general corporate purposes.

Earlier this month, the company said it expects new robots on a production line in Medford to begin production of test kits before year's end.

NewsDay,Sweet Bee's Honey Festival at Cradle of Aviation in Garden City,"Honey is about to create quite a buzz in Garden City — it's the star of its own festival Sunday at the Cradle of Aviation.

“Honey is used in everything from baked goods to mustards to liquor,” says event producer Marvin Baum. “It’s also a good source of antioxidants, helps with acid reflux conditions and has an antibacterial quality. We want people to see all the things they can get from honey.”

Additionally, there will be a giant honeybee sculpture on display, a booth from the Long Island Beekeepers Club, a screening of the nature film ""Backyard Wilderness,"" a scavenger hunt, face painting, children's activities and live music to round out the day.

Among the honey products that will be sold at the festival:

DOMESTIC HONEY

Upstate Warwick-based Magnolia House Honey sells more than 30 varieties of raw honey, including an alfalfa version sourced from hives near fields of the flower.

Owner Sandy Abrams says the 100 percent pure honey ""has not been pasteurized whatsoever — it’s not filtered only strained to remove the debris from the hives.” Sixteen-ounce jars go for $14.

One standout is a creamed cinnamon honey. Abrams puts Madagascar cinnamon sticks wrapped in cheesecloth in clover honey for six months, then removes the solids and whips the mixture for 24 hours.

“It’s amazingly delicious,” she says. “I make cinnamon buns with them.”

HONEY WINE

Winter’s Nirvana, is a craft wine blended with honey and ginger by Pazdar Winery, based in upstate Scotchtown.

“Honey is an all-natural sweetener with many different levels,” says owner-winemaker David Pazdar. “People are trying to get away from the high-fructose corn syrup. This way they can have their sweetness and not feel guilty about it.”

Sample one-ounce cups will be offered at the festival while bottles ($12) and cases ($129) will be for sale.

HONEY SOAP

Bars of honey and goat milk soap will be available via HoneyGramz of Douglaston for $8 per 4 oz.

“Honey is a natural moisturizer,” says owner Ruth Harrigan. “They come in seven different scents: lavender, honey oatmeal, eucalyptus, lilac, cherry almond, coconut mango and basil sage mint.”

Harrigan also sells mini 2 oz. portable filled honey bear containers ($5) with various romantic sayings such as “You’re so sweet, honey,” “Have a nice day, honey” and “I love you to the moon and back,honey.” She even offers holiday versions with seasonal sayings and Santa hats for $6.

INFUSED HONEY

Italian black truffle, pumpkin spice and chocolate mint are not desserts but rather flavors of infused honey from BeeWitched Bee from Northport. They are sold in honey pots that start at $10.

“It’s a secret how we do it,” says co-owner Neal Wechsler. “We use all-natural materials in the honey. If it’s lemon flavored, the entire lemon goes in. Once people have a taste, they are sold.”

They also sell bee wax products such as all-natural lip balm, which comes in 30 flavors ($4.50 each, three for $12.50), candles ($8 each, two for $15) and 40 scents of perfumes ($7 each or 3 for $20).

HONEY LIQUEUR & BOURBON

When it comes to the hard stuff, Niche Import Co. of Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, will serve up Bärenjäger's vodka-based honey liqueur and honey bourbon ($15 per 375 ml bottle).

“If bees could distill their own booze, this is what it would taste like,” says owner Jenny Manger. “It’s very forward with the honey taste.”

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics to buy opTricon GmbH of Berlin for $5.5M,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has reached an agreement to purchase a German developer of test results readers for $5.5 million in cash, executives said.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Zika, Ebola and other tropical diseases said it would purchase opTricon GmbH in Berlin.

The companies have collaborated since 2015 on handheld readers capable of reading the results of Chembio’s point-of-care tests that use blood and saliva samples. The readers are battery-powered.

“Long-term success in the point-of-care infectious diseases market requires innovation that extends beyond the diagnostic test to include data capture, transmission and storage,” Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said on Monday. “The acquisition of opTricon will enable us to further advance our innovative technology development.”

He also said opTricon’s office in Berlin’s Science & Technology Park will become Chembio’s Europe office. OpTricon will continue to produce results readers for customers who don’t compete with Chembio.

In a securities filing on Monday, Chembio said it would fund the acquisition with some of the proceeds of a $25 million stock sale. The company also said it would use the proceeds to support future growth and for other general corporate purposes.

The announcement and securities filing came after Monday’s stock market close. On Tuesday, Chembio shares dropped $1.83, or nearly 19 percent, to $8.05 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. On Tuesday the stock fell 18.5 percent to $8.05. A year ago the shares traded at $6.40.

Chembio also said Monday the installation of robots for one of its production lines in Medford is nearly complete and the manufacture of tests will start before year end.

NewsDay,Chembio lands $10.5 million order from Brazilian government,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. announced Tuesday it has received a $10.5 million order from the Brazilian government for test components and other products to detect HIV and leishmaniasis.

The products will be used for rapid tests to be produced in Brazil for use there, the Medford-based company said. The sales revenue will be received next year.

Leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies and characterized by skin ulcers.

Tuesday’s announcement is an outgrowth of Chembio’s long-standing relationship with Bio-Manguinhos, a subsidiary of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation that is responsible for providing diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicine to Brazil’s public health system.

“We are pleased with the ongoing commitment from Brazil’s Ministry of Health and the increased level of annual purchases” of tests, Chembio CEO John Sperzel said in a statement. “The use of rapid diagnostic tests is an essential element of Brazil’s response to infectious disease incidence.”

The tests involve a sample of blood or salvia.

Chembio received a $8.5 million order from Brazil earlier this year, which followed a $5.8 million order in 2017. The manufacturer also began last year to sell a Zika virus test in Brazil, which was hit hard by the mosquito-borne disease that causes brain damage in children.

Chembio reported a loss of $6.4 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017 compared with a loss of $13.3 million a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $24 million, a 34 percent gain year over year.

NewsDay,Long Island native recognized as MacArthur Foundation 'genius',"A Long Island native who dropped out of college and then tackled the AIDS epidemic head on is being honored as a ""genius"" for his life’s work of ridding worldwide disease.

Gregg Gonsalves, 54, a Yale University epidemiologist, has been named by the MacArthur Foundation as one of about 1,000 fellows, whose exceptional creativity and record of important achievements, the foundation says, hold the promise for more of the same.

“I do think we are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers; the fact that we have epidemics around the world is because we forgot that point,” he said by telephone last week. Deeply flawed health systems keep Ebola, HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases from being eradicated, he said.

“My parents instilled in me that you treat people the way you wanted to be treated,” said Gonsalves, a 1981 East Meadow High School graduate.

So he reacted compassionately instead of spurning one of his first partners after that individual fearfully confessed he was HIV positive — and dove into analyzing possible treatments.

“If you care for somebody, you don’t turn your back on them,” said Gonsalves, who by then had left his studies at Boston’s Tufts University and moved to New York City, where he waited on tables and intensified his involvement with ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.

The group surmounted the prejudice, indifference, fear — and sometimes terror — early AIDS patients encountered because no medicine could save them. ACT UP forced an unfair health system to prioritize AIDS and give them a say in the research that by the mid-1990s created effective treatments, social historians say.

Gonsalves, who is HIV positive himself, resumed his college education, earning his bachelor's degree from Yale in 2011, followed by a Ph.D. in 2017

He said he learned the importance of giving back to the community from his parents, both former schoolteachers. He noted his mother, Norma Gonsalves, a Republican who retired last year as the Nassau County legislature's presiding officer, was a dedicated local activist before entering politics.

“I think, actually, I didn’t fall far from the tree,” Gregg Gonsalves said. “I think the main point is: We may be on different sides of the political aisle, but we are both committed to community service, committed to grass roots organizing.”

Norma Gonsalves, 84, of East Meadow, in turn credited her son for encouraging her to try again after she lost her first race in 1995 by just 68 votes. “My son said, ‘You can’t back off now,’” said Gonsalves, who easily won the next contest.

As for her son’s fellowship, “The best thing is, he may be a genius, but he’s got a big heart, he’s a loving son, and he knows the importance of family, so I think he’s worthy of the award …it’s something that I’m not only proud of him, but not surprised.”

The MacArthur Foundation, in announcing its 25 honorees for 2018 on Oct. 4, cited Gonsalves for his domestic and global work as an HIV/AIDS activist, beginning in 1989 with ACT UP, bringing communities and scientists together and deploying quantitative models to spot outbreaks early and demonstrate cost-effective treatments.

Among his achievements, “Gonsalves has determined how to identify hot spots for HIV testing in real time"" and ""assessed the epidemiological costs of emerging epidemics of HIV in the United States due to intravenous drug use and lack of needle exchange programs,” the foundation said.

Gonsalves said nowadays he is interested “in the intersection of HIV and Hepatitis C in states like Connecticut and New York, in New Haven and Nassau counties,” which is tied to people struggling with opioids. Heroin can be less costly, but injections can spread those two diseases; outbreaks also are occurring in the Midwest and South.

“So I’m interested in how to sort of use quantitative methods to better predict HIV and hepatitis C outbreaks and opioid overdoses,” he said, as those diseases “sort of travel together.”

Gonsalves, saying he was surprised and honored by the award, has not figured out how he will spend the $625,000 he will receive over five years — with no strings attached. And he was both modest and hesitant about being singled out.

“But my work is collaborative…I may be sort of working with scientists now, but it’s a team effort.”",10/10/2018
NewsDay,Lady Gaga co-writes powerful essay about suicide and mental health,"In a call for action, Lady Gaga and the head of the World Health Organization are advocating for better understanding of mental health issues and steps to stem the global epidemic of suicide.

“By the time you finish reading this, at least six people will have killed themselves around the world,” the singer-actress-philanthropist, 32, and WHO Director-General Tedros

Adhanom, 53, wrote in a joint essay for the U.K. newspaper The Guardian. And they added: “Stigma, fear and lack of understanding compound the suffering of those affected and prevent the bold action that is so desperately needed and so long overdue.”

Citing chef and TV personality Anthony Bourdain and designer Kate Spade among the 800,000 people who kill themselves annually worldwide, they noted that society struggles to discuss mental health openly “or to offer adequate care or resources. Within families and communities, we often remain silenced by a shame that tells us that those with mental illness are somehow less worthy or at fault for their own suffering. Instead of treating those facing mental health conditions with the compassion we would offer to someone with a physical injury or illness, we ostracize, blame and condemn.”

Offering WHO statistics showing mental health conditions cost the world $2.5 trillion a year in treatment and lost productivity, the two said, “Research shows there is a fourfold return on investment for every dollar spent on treating depression and anxiety, the most common mental health conditions, making spending on the issue a great investment for both political leaders and employers, in addition to generating savings in the health sector.”

One of the most effective current efforts, they wrote, is in New York, “where ThriveNYC has brought local leaders together to build a comprehensive mental health plan.”

Calling for the same type of coordinated global effort that addressed the HIV/AIDS epidemic, they urged “a new movement — including people who have faced mental illness themselves — to call on governments and industry to put mental health at the top of their agendas.”",10/10/2018
NewsDay,INEXGANG181014,"Edwin recently recalled the afternoon in 2005 when he decided to join the MS-13 gang as a personal low point. He was 14, recently arrived on Long Island, and hating his life.

A group of boys who belonged to the SWP gang had been harassing him in the hallways, cafeteria and locker rooms at Turtle Hook Middle School in Uniondale.

They called him names, pushed him and pinned him against walls and, when no adults were around, punched him. Even though they were immigrants too, they used expletives to berate him as an immigrant, mocked his inability to speak English, commented on his unfashionable clothes and dubbed him “primo” — literally “cousin,” which he said was a demeaning term for a “hick.”

Edwin, who asked to not be identified by his full or street names, had been leaving school in a rush to avoid his assailants, but that day about 10 of them waited on his path. One called him out to fight. He said he couldn’t turn around without looking like a coward.

They got down to it and when Edwin landed punches the other boys jumped him. They were punching and kicking him senseless and he thought he was going to die.

Then, something of a miracle happened. He remembers seeing a souped-up Toyota 4Runner SUV pull up out of nowhere and stop. His attackers ran. A tough-looking guy in his 30s told him in Spanish “Súbete” — to hop in the car.

“To this day I don’t know who he was,” says Edwin.

The man revealed that he was an MS-13 member in Hempstead. He delivered him to safety.

Thus began Edwin’s devotion to an organization that largely bypasses the sustaining criminal rackets of other gangs for a loyalty built on crude violence, with a lure so potent it has enabled it to regroup despite decades of crackdowns. Only a turn toward religion while he was in the depths of sadness and depression enabled him to escape this life and replace it with something better.

AN UNKNOWN NEWCOMER

When MS-13 first arrived on Long Island, it would have been hard to imagine Edwin being drawn to the gang.

Against a landscape populated by Latin Kings, Legion of Doom, the then-emerging Bloods and Crips, among many rivals, John Oliva, a retired Suffolk County detective who specialized in gangs, remembers driving north on Crooked Hill Road in Brentwood in 1996 when he first saw the blue letters “M” and “S” with the number “13,” painted two-feet high on the side of a building.

The graffiti was a head scratcher. He had no idea that it signified the arrival of a gang that was uniquely violent in a very violent world.

The Mara Salvatrucha — slang for “Salvadoran gang,” as the MS-13 is also known — has its origins in Los Angeles. There, young Salvadorans who had fled the civil war in their country from the 1970s and 80s felt threatened and outnumbered by Mexican gangs and banded together, gang experts and federal government agencies have said.

The gang sunk roots in El Salvador after gang members were deported and set up operations there but spread internationally as well — growing throughout Central America and the United States, with many members concentrated in parts of New York, Virginia and Washington D.C.

Those are places where large populations of immigrants from Central America have flocked, fleeing poverty as well as the threat of violence associated with the gang.

Since Oliva’s first sighting, Long Island has turned into a hive of activity for MS-13.

County police officials have recently estimated membership at 500 in Nassau County and about 600 in Suffolk County, though one federal prosecutor speaking at a roundtable with President Donald Trump earlier this year stated that “2,000 are estimated to be right here in Long Island.” Nationwide, the estimate is 10,000.

Its growth, resilience and trademark viciousness have all surprised experts more used to gangs supporting themselves through entrenched criminal enterprises and using violence to support their rackets.

Although MS-13 leaders have been trying to develop a more sophisticated and lucrative operation, the gang has traditionally not run large-scale criminal enterprises that would put it in competition with cartels, according to gang experts. Members are usually involved in low-level drug dealing and extortion, and most work at menial jobs.

Steven S. Dudley, an American University researcher who has investigated the gang under a U.S. Department of Justice grant, said that the motives of MS-13 members are more petty and personal. “It’s not about creating a powerful criminal structure,” he said. “It’s about proving their self-worth within this perverted social structure, and a lot of that has to do with violence.”

The gang’s Long Island rampage reached a peak in 2016 and 2017, with a score of killings linked to MS-13 in both counties.

There were hackings with machetes, knives and other cutting tools, beatings with baseball bats and the occasional shooting. Bodies were found in shallow graves in the woods. Some were killed in or near residential streets.

THE GANG AS FAMILY

Simple protection, rather than anything that wanton, is what Edwin says drew him to the gang toward the end of his first school year. He said he wanted to emulate the mysterious figure who rescued him.

He had not been exposed to gangs in El Salvador, because he grew up more than two hours from the gritty neighborhoods in the capital of San Salvador that served as their wellsprings. But after his encounters with the Uniondale boys he decided that he couldn’t go it alone.

“I thought, ‘This is the solution so that I can be protected in school,’” he said.

Edwin went home, logged onto MySpace and started searching. He found a profile for an MS-13 clique in nearby Westbury and chatted with the person running it. He soon knew all he needed to know: If he joined, the group would have his back.

These days, Edwin doesn’t look threatening, but he says he ran with the worst of them. He’s 27, easy to smile, even shy, slender and 5’7” tall.

While sipping agave lemonade at a Panera in Bay Shore, he displayed a photo from those days, wearing a sporty shirt several times bigger than his size and hugging a girl, his eyes hardened into what he described as “a look that could kill.”

Edwin agreed to discuss his past because he wants others to know that he turned his life around and that it is possible for them.

He builds concrete patios, driveways and paths during the day. On nights and weekends, he’s dedicated to prayer, preaching and worship at an evangelical Hispanic church in the Town of Islip.

Edwin said he was 13 when he and an older teenage sister journeyed about 25 days from their rural village in Chalatenango, El Salvador, through the length of Mexico to the U.S. border, which they crossed illegally into Texas.

Like the thousands of unaccompanied minors who have made that trek to Long Island, they sought to reunite with a mother they had not seen in years and a father he had never met, Edwin said. Once they made it here, they realized their mom and dad had split and started new families.

They went to live in Uniondale with their dad, who he said had paid to smuggle them, but he seemed uninterested in them. If he wasn’t out working, he was out drinking, and he would arrive in a foul mood and become verbally abusive, Edwin said.

Edwin would find his family, instead, in the gang.

Back in those days when he first approached MS-13, he said, he took a taxi from school with his dad’s money and went to hang out with gang members at a Westbury street that was their hangout spot. He felt accepted, and he returned, again and again.

To prove their allegiance, prospective homeboys — as top members are called — are expected to commit a violent crime against a perceived gang enemy and to endure a 13-second beating by their clique. There are a variety of explanations for why the number 13 has significance to the gang, from the prosaic — that “M” is the thirteenth letter — to the supernatural — that the number carries magical and even demonic power.

According to police accounts, young women have had to submit to gang rape to be accepted as homegirls.

Edwin was eventually permitted to join the Normandy Locotes Salvatruchas, a clique from El Salvador that was then one the gang’s most feared cells.

He endured a traditional initiation beating by about a dozen members as one slowly counted, telling himself he’d rather take those punches and kicks one time than be abused, attacked and belittled every day. Uno, dos, tres . . . All the way to 13, as is the norm.

He said he learned the hand sign of the Devil’s Horns, dressed in trademark loose shirts and blue Nikes, and carried a blue bandanna that he let hang from a back pocket.

Edwin bears the physical and emotional scars from those years. He compares the gang to a satanic cult, with its adoration of thug life, gang signs, devilish tattoos and graffiti.

Across a restaurant table, he quickly put his hands together — his index fingers pointing out, the middle and ring fingers hidden, his pinkies and thumbs curled into semicircles — and asked: “What do you think this is?”

His answer: It’s Satan’s face.

He said that when he started looking the part and telling others that he was a Normandy guy he noticed an immediate change of attitude. The bullying stopped. Other boys made way for him in the hallways. Girls looked at him differently.

“Wherever I arrived, people respected me,” Edwin recalled. “They offered me beer, girls, drugs . . . There were a bunch of girls. Those girls love to hang out with mareros,” as gang members are known among Central Americans. “It was like achieving a rank for some of them.”

He didn’t want to go into detail about some gang activities, saying that life is behind him, but he did discuss how he found himself enmeshed in the group’s violent culture.

Joining the gang gave Edwin his revenge. He and his crew jumped guys who had bothered him. He won’t say much about those incidents, other than he’s ashamed of them.

Becoming a gang member created its own problems. He became a moving target for other gangs and he learned not to go out alone. He started carrying a serrated knife. Others kept longer weapons, including machetes.

He said the purpose of using knives rather than guns was to avoid capture. They knew that Nassau police, and later Suffolk, had installed soundwave detectors at undisclosed locations to pinpoint where gunshots were fired. Cops would respond quickly to citizen reports of “shots fired.” Fistfights and stabbings left time to escape.

Membership in the gang had its requirements. Soldiers couldn’t wear other gangs’ colors, couldn’t deny membership in MS-13 if asked and had to attend meetings in the Hicksville woods twice a week. They had to join in beatings of rivals and go on the hunt for them if told to do so. They had to take part in the initiation and punishment of members, boys or girls.

He said each clique has rules. Normandy girls weren’t sexually assaulted, he said. Instead, they were beaten up by other girls in an equivalent initiation rite to the males’.

He doesn’t know, though, how recent cliques, such as the Sailors or Leeward implicated in the recent murders of 2016 and 2017 in Brentwood and Central Islip, operate or whether they followed the same code of honor. Those cliques were not as prominent when he was active.

And while law-enforcement authorities have not linked all recent victims to gang activity, Edwin maintains that the MS-13 members he knew didn’t attack people who weren’t part of that life. He said some of his clique members were punished for getting into fights outside their turf wars. “The gangs don’t bother people just for the sake of it,” he said. “That’s the law of the gang.”

Edwin said he was locked up seven times at juvenile facilities, mostly in Nassau County, and that five orders of protection were filed against him to protect other young people who had come to fear him. His arrests couldn’t be verified because juvenile arrest records are kept confidential.

“You have to show,” he said, “that you are willing to do whatever for the group.”

He told this story: In 2008 he and his crew staked out a house where members of the rival 18th Street gang were living. They wore hoods and bandannas and disguised their faces. When the other teenagers came out they went at them, ready to cause serious injuries, but their rivals ran to a car and took off.

They left a person behind, though — a girlfriend of one gang member who was paralyzed with fear. Edwin said he egged on his girlfriend to give her a beating. Some Normandy clique members watched; others vandalized the house.

The incident did not end there. He was later identified as being involved, allegedly by another MS-13 member who was in custody. Nassau police detectives came to his father’s house weeks later, looking for him, and arrested him on the spot. They locked up his sister as well, even though he still says she wasn’t there, and that she paid for the assault that his then-girlfriend committed.

At the precinct where he was processed, Edwin said, he saw an MS-13 member who he suspected was the snitch. Edwin and another MS-13 member spotted him on the street later. He recalls hitting him with a bottle and how they punched him near unconscious. His accomplice pulled out a long blade and was going to kill him, but Edwin said he stopped him.

He claimed he never went as far as murder.

Edwin said he and his clique members would often usually just get together and drink Coronas.

He remembers snorting cocaine with them, first because it helped him enjoy the alcohol without getting sick. That led to binging on the white powder. He overdosed more than once and fell, foaming at the mouth and convulsing. His homies watched over him and fed him milk, so he could recover, he said.

He would steal, he would threaten others and he would fight to get what he wanted. He said he stole from relatives, including cocaine that his dad saved for his personal use. The worst thing that happened, he said, was when a cousin of his who was not an MS-13 member was killed in a Westbury shooting because, as Edwin told it, rival gang members had seen them hanging out together.

Still, Edwin saw himself as a soldier of the Mara Salvatrucha. He joined in bar fights and jailhouse melees against others from the 18th Street, Trinitarios, Latin Kings, Bloods and Crips gangs. For many of those fights he only remembers throwing punches and getting punched.

Skin on his right forearm looks like the stitched hide of a football, a mark from one such fight at a Hempstead nightclub. He had been with his crew, drinking and having a good time, when young men arrived and started throwing hand signs, he said. They were Trinitarios — largely a Dominican gang that this June gained considerable notoriety in the mistaken identity killing of Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, 15, stabbed with knives and machetes at a bodega in the Bronx. Their hand gestures were a way to claim territory and disrespect his clique, Edwin said.

This meant they had to fight. He doesn’t remember how it happened but one of them broke his right arm, and he later took himself to the hospital. The scar is a reminder of where a metal rod was inserted to repair the injury.

Another time, he said, a group of rival gang members found him walking around Uniondale alone and they pummeled him so hard that he was bleeding from his ears. He ran down Jerusalem Avenue while his assailants chased him wielding machetes. He made it to a gas station. Police arrived and, though he didn’t know who had called them, he said he was relieved that they arrested some of his assailants.

He remembers one of them, a member of the 18th Street gang, turning to him when they ran into each other in court and telling him in Spanish: Sí te vas a morir.

Rough translation: You are going to die, for sure.

The episode helped cement in Edwin’s mind what he was facing, but he didn’t yet see a way out. As he explains it today, there were three possible destinations for an MS-13 gang member: prison, the hospital or the cemetery.

He may have been living the party life with his brethren, spending time with lots of girls, as he put it. But deep inside, Edwin said, he was consumed by sadness.

Through the times in and out of jail, the constant demand for loyalty and growing mistrust of other gang members, he came to feel that no one cared about him and that he didn’t care either.

He had lost the trust of his real family.

“My relatives called me a black sheep and they told me I was going to die in the streets,” he said. “At one point I felt so alone . . . I was drinking and doing drugs by myself and I would just start crying and I wanted to kill myself.”

When locked up at juvenile detention facility in upstate Dutchess County, he took well to the discipline. He had to get up early, do his bed, tuck his shirt, walk straight and behave well if he wanted to get out.

He noticed visiting preachers who talked about a new life.

Having no one else, he turned to God.

He found himself looking to the forest through the bars of a small window, crying out for forgiveness.

He eventually moved in with an aunt in Bay Shore to get away. He noticed that a girl he friended on Facebook was posting about her faith.

Edwin asked her where she worshipped. He showed up one day at a Spanish-language service, led by a Salvadoran pastor. Churchgoers greeted him as if they had been glad to see him. He felt their acceptance and returned to other services. As the pastor tells it, Edwin broke down during a retreat.

“I remember the way he cried. He was bawling because his repentance was genuine,” the pastor said in Spanish. “The first thing he did was to forgive his parents because he was full of hate for them.”

Newsday is withholding the name of the church to protect Edwin's anonymity.

In joining, Edwin took advantage of what he came to know was an accepted way out in MS-13 culture. He said the gang allows members to leave if they commit themselves to a Christian life and truly start anew. Some call former members like him “calmados” or “calmed ones.”

His church works to reach young people who are lost, the pastor said. It offers them youth Bible study groups in Spanish, Christian parties featuring reggaetón and hip-hop with uplifting messages, outings to parks, a competitive soccer league. About 60 young people have renounced the street life through the church, the pastor said.

Edwin, among them, is a church leader.

“Many of these young people have lacked father figures, they have lacked love, they have lacked identity,” the pastor said. “When they come to the church we know they need us to receive them with open arms, not to be rejected, and that we need to work to help them find their true identity, to let them know that they didn’t come to this world to be violent, but that God has a purpose for them and it’s a good one.”

His aunt said Edwin’s transformation has benefited his family and others. He’s become a role model to young relatives, including her 15-year-old son, who started high school this September.

“He didn’t let himself be defeated by vice, by the gangs or by Satan,” the aunt, who is 53 and works cleaning houses, said in Spanish. She asked to remain anonymous.

Feride Castillo — co-founder of the nonprofit Empowerment Collaborative of Long Island, which works with youth trapped in the cycle of school truancy, gang involvement and substance abuse — said other programs outside of churches can also help those teens renounce the gang life.

“There are some who are far gone, and we know that because they have committed heinous crimes,"" Castillo said. ""And then there are the guys who want what comes along with being part of a gang, the power, the respect and feeling they want to be a part of something, and those are the ones we can reach.”

They need access to programs, she said, where they can be listened to and where they can start to envision a way forward.

It’s been three years since Edwin found his path.

On a recent Thursday evening, he preached to three girls and seven boys, all Salvadoran teens, gathered in a small living room and kitchenette in a second-floor Bay Shore apartment.

It was a steamy night. The door was open and the sound of rushing cars on Sunrise Highway and the summer crickets out in the yard blended with his voice. He closed his eyes and sought to convey his emotion through a crescendo of prayer.

“Father of glory,” he pleaded on the youth’s behalf. “May they keep striving, let them not be lost, let them not be dragged by the currents of this world.”",09/10/2018

Edwin went home, logged onto MySpace and started searching. He found a profile for an MS-13 clique in nearby Westbury and chatted with the person running it. He soon knew all he needed to know: If he joined, the group would have his back.

These days, Edwin doesn’t look threatening, but he says he ran with the worst of them. He’s 27, easy to smile, even shy, slender and 5’7” tall.

While sipping agave lemonade at a Panera in Bay Shore, he displayed a photo from those days, wearing a sporty shirt several times bigger than his size and hugging a girl, his eyes hardened into what he described as “a look that could kill.”

Edwin agreed to discuss his past because he wants others to know that he turned his life around and that it is possible for them.

He builds concrete patios, driveways and paths during the day. On nights and weekends, he’s dedicated to prayer, preaching and worship at an evangelical Hispanic church in the Town of Islip.

Edwin said he was 13 when he and an older teenage sister journeyed about 25 days from their rural village in Chalatenango, El Salvador, through the length of Mexico to the U.S. border, which they crossed illegally into Texas.

Like the thousands of unaccompanied minors who have made that trek to Long Island, they sought to reunite with a mother they had not seen in years and a father he had never met, Edwin said. Once they made it here, they realized their mom and dad had split and started new families.

They went to live in Uniondale with their dad, who he said had paid to smuggle them, but he seemed uninterested in them. If he wasn’t out working, he was out drinking, and he would arrive in a foul mood and become verbally abusive, Edwin said.

Edwin would find his family, instead, in the gang.

Back in those days when he first approached MS-13, he said, he took a taxi from school with his dad’s money and went to hang out with gang members at a Westbury street that was their hangout spot. He felt accepted, and he returned, again and again.

To prove their allegiance, prospective homeboys — as top members are called — are expected to commit a violent crime against a perceived gang enemy and to endure a 13-second beating by their clique. There are a variety of explanations for why the number 13 has significance to the gang, from the prosaic — that “M” is the thirteenth letter — to the supernatural — that the number carries magical and even demonic power.

According to police accounts, young women have had to submit to gang rape to be accepted as homegirls.

Edwin was eventually permitted to join the Normandy Locotes Salvatruchas, a clique from El Salvador that was then one the gang’s most feared cells.

He endured a traditional initiation beating by about a dozen members as one slowly counted, telling himself he’d rather take those punches and kicks one time than be abused, attacked and belittled every day. Uno, dos, tres . . . All the way to 13, as is the norm.

He said he learned the hand sign of the Devil’s Horns, dressed in trademark loose shirts and blue Nikes, and carried a blue bandanna that he let hang from a back pocket.

Edwin bears the physical and emotional scars from those years. He compares the gang to a satanic cult, with its adoration of thug life, gang signs, devilish tattoos and graffiti.

Across a restaurant table, he quickly put his hands together — his index fingers pointing out, the middle and ring fingers hidden, his pinkies and thumbs curled into semicircles — and asked: “What do you think this is?”

His answer: It’s Satan’s face.

He said that when he started looking the part and telling others that he was a Normandy guy he noticed an immediate change of attitude. The bullying stopped. Other boys made way for him in the hallways. Girls looked at him differently.

“Wherever I arrived, people respected me,” Edwin recalled. “They offered me beer, girls, drugs . . . There were a bunch of girls. Those girls love to hang out with mareros,” as gang members are known among Central Americans. “It was like achieving a rank for some of them.”

He didn’t want to go into detail about some gang activities, saying that life is behind him, but he did discuss how he found himself enmeshed in the group’s violent culture.

Joining the gang gave Edwin his revenge. He and his crew jumped guys who had bothered him. He won’t say much about those incidents, other than he’s ashamed of them.

Becoming a gang member created its own problems. He became a moving target for other gangs and he learned not to go out alone. He started carrying a serrated knife. Others kept longer weapons, including machetes.

He said the purpose of using knives rather than guns was to avoid capture. They knew that Nassau police, and later Suffolk, had installed soundwave detectors at undisclosed locations to pinpoint where gunshots were fired. Cops would respond quickly to citizen reports of “shots fired.” Fistfights and stabbings left time to escape.

Membership in the gang had its requirements. Soldiers couldn’t wear other gangs’ colors, couldn’t deny membership in MS-13 if asked and had to attend meetings in the Hicksville woods twice a week. They had to join in beatings of rivals and go on the hunt for them if told to do so. They had to take part in the initiation and punishment of members, boys or girls.

He said each clique has rules. Normandy girls weren’t sexually assaulted, he said. Instead, they were beaten up by other girls in an equivalent initiation rite to the males’.

He doesn’t know, though, how recent cliques, such as the Sailors or Leeward implicated in the recent murders of 2016 and 2017 in Brentwood and Central Islip, operate or whether they followed the same code of honor. Those cliques were not as prominent when he was active.

And while law-enforcement authorities have not linked all recent victims to gang activity, Edwin maintains that the MS-13 members he knew didn’t attack people who weren’t part of that life. He said some of his clique members were punished for getting into fights outside their turf wars. “The gangs don’t bother people just for the sake of it,” he said. “That’s the law of the gang.”

Edwin said he was locked up seven times at juvenile facilities, mostly in Nassau County, and that five orders of protection were filed against him to protect other young people who had come to fear him. His arrests couldn’t be verified because juvenile arrest records are kept confidential.

“You have to show,” he said, “that you are willing to do whatever for the group.”

He told this story: In 2008 he and his crew staked out a house where members of the rival 18th Street gang were living. They wore hoods and bandannas and disguised their faces. When the other teenagers came out they went at them, ready to cause serious injuries, but their rivals ran to a car and took off.

They left a person behind, though — a girlfriend of one gang member who was paralyzed with fear. Edwin said he egged on his girlfriend to give her a beating. Some Normandy clique members watched; others vandalized the house.

The incident did not end there. He was later identified as being involved, allegedly by another MS-13 member who was in custody. Nassau police detectives came to his father’s house weeks later, looking for him, and arrested him on the spot. They locked up his sister as well, even though he still says she wasn’t there, and that she paid for the assault that his then-girlfriend committed.

At the precinct where he was processed, Edwin said, he saw an MS-13 member who he suspected was the snitch. Edwin and another MS-13 member spotted him on the street later. He recalls hitting him with a bottle and how they punched him near unconscious. His accomplice pulled out a long blade and was going to kill him, but Edwin said he stopped him.

He claimed he never went as far as murder.

Edwin said he and his clique members would often usually just get together and drink Coronas.

He remembers snorting cocaine with them, first because it helped him enjoy the alcohol without getting sick. That led to binging on the white powder. He overdosed more than once and fell, foaming at the mouth and convulsing. His homies watched over him and fed him milk, so he could recover, he said.

He would steal, he would threaten others and he would fight to get what he wanted. He said he stole from relatives, including cocaine that his dad saved for his personal use. The worst thing that happened, he said, was when a cousin of his who was not an MS-13 member was killed in a Westbury shooting because, as Edwin told it, rival gang members had seen them hanging out together.

Still, Edwin saw himself as a soldier of the Mara Salvatrucha. He joined in bar fights and jailhouse melees against others from the 18th Street, Trinitarios, Latin Kings, Bloods and Crips gangs. For many of those fights he only remembers throwing punches and getting punched.

Skin on his right forearm looks like the stitched hide of a football, a mark from one such fight at a Hempstead nightclub. He had been with his crew, drinking and having a good time, when young men arrived and started throwing hand signs, he said. They were Trinitarios — largely a Dominican gang that this June gained considerable notoriety in the mistaken identity killing of Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, 15, stabbed with knives and machetes at a bodega in the Bronx. Their hand gestures were a way to claim territory and disrespect his clique, Edwin said.

This meant they had to fight. He doesn’t remember how it happened but one of them broke his right arm, and he later took himself to the hospital. The scar is a reminder of where a metal rod was inserted to repair the injury.

Another time, he said, a group of rival gang members found him walking around Uniondale alone and they pummeled him so hard that he was bleeding from his ears. He ran down Jerusalem Avenue while his assailants chased him wielding machetes. He made it to a gas station. Police arrived and, though he didn’t know who had called them, he said he was relieved that they arrested some of his assailants.

He remembers one of them, a member of the 18th Street gang, turning to him when they ran into each other in court and telling him in Spanish: Sí te vas a morir.

Rough translation: You are going to die, for sure.

The episode helped cement in Edwin’s mind what he was facing, but he didn’t yet see a way out. As he explains it today, there were three possible destinations for an MS-13 gang member: prison, the hospital or the cemetery.

He may have been living the party life with his brethren, spending time with lots of girls, as he put it. But deep inside, Edwin said, he was consumed by sadness.

Through the times in and out of jail, the constant demand for loyalty and growing mistrust of other gang members, he came to feel that no one cared about him and that he didn’t care either.

He had lost the trust of his real family.

“My relatives called me a black sheep and they told me I was going to die in the streets,” he said. “At one point I felt so alone . . . I was drinking and doing drugs by myself and I would just start crying and I wanted to kill myself.”

When locked up at juvenile detention facility in upstate Dutchess County, he took well to the discipline. He had to get up early, do his bed, tuck his shirt, walk straight and behave well if he wanted to get out.

He noticed visiting preachers who talked about a new life.

Having no one else, he turned to God.

He found himself looking to the forest through the bars of a small window, crying out for forgiveness.

He eventually moved in with an aunt in Bay Shore to get away. He noticed that a girl he friended on Facebook was posting about her faith.

Edwin asked her where she worshipped. He showed up one day at a Spanish-language service, led by a Salvadoran pastor. Churchgoers greeted him as if they had been glad to see him. He felt their acceptance and returned to other services. As the pastor tells it, Edwin broke down during a retreat.

“I remember the way he cried. He was bawling because his repentance was genuine,” the pastor said in Spanish. “The first thing he did was to forgive his parents because he was full of hate for them.”

Newsday is withholding the name of the church to protect Edwin's anonymity.

In joining, Edwin took advantage of what he came to know was an accepted way out in MS-13 culture. He said the gang allows members to leave if they commit themselves to a Christian life and truly start anew. Some call former members like him “calmados” or “calmed ones.”

His church works to reach young people who are lost, the pastor said. It offers them youth Bible study groups in Spanish, Christian parties featuring reggaetón and hip-hop with uplifting messages, outings to parks, a competitive soccer league. About 60 young people have renounced the street life through the church, the pastor said.

Edwin, among them, is a church leader.

“Many of these young people have lacked father figures, they have lacked love, they have lacked identity,” the pastor said. “When they come to the church we know they need us to receive them with open arms, not to be rejected, and that we need to work to help them find their true identity, to let them know that they didn’t come to this world to be violent, but that God has a purpose for them and it’s a good one.”

His aunt said Edwin’s transformation has benefited his family and others. He’s become a role model to young relatives, including her 15-year-old son, who started high school this September.

“He didn’t let himself be defeated by vice, by the gangs or by Satan,” the aunt, who is 53 and works cleaning houses, said in Spanish. She asked to remain anonymous.

Feride Castillo — co-founder of the nonprofit Empowerment Collaborative of Long Island, which works with youth trapped in the cycle of school truancy, gang involvement and substance abuse — said other programs outside of churches can also help those teens renounce the gang life.

“There are some who are far gone, and we know that because they have committed heinous crimes,"" Castillo said. ""And then there are the guys who want what comes along with being part of a gang, the power, the respect and feeling they want to be a part of something, and those are the ones we can reach.”

They need access to programs, she said, where they can be listened to and where they can start to envision a way forward.

It’s been three years since Edwin found his path.

On a recent Thursday evening, he preached to three girls and seven boys, all Salvadoran teens, gathered in a small living room and kitchenette in a second-floor Bay Shore apartment.

It was a steamy night. The door was open and the sound of rushing cars on Sunrise Highway and the summer crickets out in the yard blended with his voice. He closed his eyes and sought to convey his emotion through a crescendo of prayer.

“Father of glory,” he pleaded on the youth’s behalf. “May they keep striving, let them not be lost, let them not be dragged by the currents of this world.”",09/10/2018
NewsDay,"At 14, MS-13 became his family. Here’s how he got out.","Edwin recalled the afternoon in 2005 when he decided to join the MS-13 gang as a personal low point. He was 14, recently arrived on Long Island, and hating his life.

A group of boys who belonged to the SWP gang had been harassing him in the hallways, cafeteria and locker rooms at Turtle Hook Middle School in Uniondale.

They called him names, pushed him and pinned him against walls and, when no adults were around, punched him. Even though they were immigrants too, they used expletives to berate him as an immigrant, mocked his inability to speak English, commented on his unfashionable clothes and dubbed him ""primo""— literally ""cousin,"" which he said was a demeaning term for a ""hick.""

Edwin, who asked to not be identified by his full or street names, had been leaving school in a rush to avoid his assailants, but that day about 10 of them waited on his path. One called him out to fight. He said he couldn’t turn around without looking like a coward.

They got down to it, and when Edwin landed punches, the other boys jumped him. They were punching and kicking him senseless and he thought he was going to die.

Then, something of a miracle happened. He remembers seeing a souped-up Toyota 4Runner SUV pull up out of nowhere and stop. His attackers ran. A tough-looking guy in his 30s told him in Spanish ""Súbete"" — to hop in the car.

""To this day I don’t know who he was,"" Edwin said.

The man revealed that he was an MS-13 member in Hempstead. He delivered him to safety.

Thus began Edwin’s devotion to an organization that largely bypasses the sustaining criminal rackets of other gangs for a loyalty built on crude violence, with a lure so potent it has enabled it to regroup despite decades of crackdowns. Only a turn toward religion while he was in the depths of sadness and depression enabled him to escape this life and replace it with something better.

An unknown newcomer

When MS-13 first arrived on Long Island, it would have been hard to imagine Edwin being drawn to the gang.

The landscape was populated by the Latin Kings, Legion of Doom, the then-emerging Bloods and Crips and other rivals. John Oliva, a retired Suffolk County detective who specialized in gangs, remembers driving north on Crooked Hill Road in Brentwood in 1996 when he first saw the blue letters “M” and “S” with the number “13,” painted 2 feet high on the side of a building.

The graffiti was a head-scratcher. He had no idea that it signified the arrival of a gang that was uniquely violent in a very violent world.

The Mara Salvatrucha — slang for ""Salvadoran gang,"" as the MS-13 is also known — has its origins in Los Angeles. There, young Salvadorans who had fled the civil war in their country from the 1970s and ’80s felt threatened and outnumbered by Mexican gangs and banded together, gang experts and federal government agencies have said.

The gang sunk roots in El Salvador after gang members were deported and set up operations there, but it spread internationally as well — growing throughout Central America and the United States, with many members concentrated in parts of New York, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

Those are places where large populations of immigrants from Central America have flocked, fleeing poverty as well as the threat of violence associated with the gang.

Since Oliva’s first sighting, Long Island has turned into a hive of activity for MS-13.

County police officials have recently estimated membership at 500 in Nassau County and about 600 in Suffolk County, though one federal prosecutor speaking at a roundtable with President Donald Trump earlier this year stated that ""2,000 are estimated to be right here in Long Island."" Nationwide, the estimate is 10,000.

Its growth, resilience and trademark viciousness have all surprised experts more used to gangs supporting themselves through entrenched criminal enterprises and using violence to support their rackets.

‘It’s not about creating a powerful criminal structure… It’s about proving their self-worth within this perverted social structure, and a lot of that has to do with violence.’ -Steven S. Dudley, American University researcher

Although MS-13 leaders have been trying to develop a more sophisticated and lucrative operation, the gang has traditionally not run large-scale criminal enterprises that would put it in competition with cartels, according to gang experts. Members are usually involved in low-level drug dealing and extortion, and most work at menial jobs.

Steven S. Dudley, an American University researcher who has investigated the gang under a U.S. Department of Justice grant, said that the motives of MS-13 members are more petty and personal.

""It’s not about creating a powerful criminal structure,"" he said. ""It’s about proving their self-worth within this perverted social structure, and a lot of that has to do with violence.""

The gang’s Long Island rampage reached a peak in 2016 and 2017, with a score of killings linked to MS-13 in both counties.

There were hackings with machetes, knives and other cutting tools, beatings with baseball bats, and the occasional shooting. Bodies were found in shallow graves in the woods. Some were killed in or near residential streets.

The gang as family

Simple protection, rather than anything that wanton, is what Edwin says drew him to the gang toward the end of his first school year. He said he wanted to emulate the mysterious figure who rescued him.

He had not been exposed to gangs in El Salvador, because he grew up more than two hours from the gritty neighborhoods in the capital of San Salvador that served as their wellsprings. But after his encounters with the Uniondale boys, he decided that he couldn’t go it alone.

His aunt said Edwin’s transformation has benefited his family and others. He’s become a role model to young relatives, including her 15-year-old son, who started high school this September.

""He didn’t let himself be defeated by vice, by the gangs or by Satan,"" the aunt, who is 53 and works cleaning houses, said in Spanish. She asked to remain anonymous.

Feride Castillo — co-founder of the nonprofit Empowerment Collaborative of Long Island, which works with youth trapped in the cycle of school truancy, gang involvement and substance abuse — said other programs outside of churches can also help those teens renounce the gang life.

""There are some who are far gone, and we know that because they have committed heinous crimes,"" Castillo said. ""And then there are the guys who want what comes along with being part of a gang, the power, the respect and feeling they want to be a part of something, and those are the ones we can reach.""

They need access to programs, she said, where they can be listened to and where they can start to envision a way forward.

It’s been three years since Edwin found his path.

On a recent Thursday evening, he preached to three girls and seven boys, all Salvadoran teens, gathered in a small living room and kitchenette in a second-floor Bay Shore apartment.

It was a steamy night. The door was open and the sound of rushing cars on Sunrise Highway and the summer crickets out in the yard blended with his voice. He closed his eyes and sought to convey his emotion through a crescendo of prayer.

""Father of glory,"" he pleaded on the youth’s behalf. ""May they keep striving, let them not be lost, let them not be dragged by the currents of this world.""",09/10/2018
NewsDay,Melania Trump’s trip to Africa,"Melania Trump is keen to make a difference in the lives of children around the world and noted as much during a speech at the 73rd U.N. General Assembly. In her remarks, she made direct mention of the good work being led by fellow first ladies H.E. Rebecca Akufo-Addo, H.E. Margaret Kenyatta and H.E. Gertrude Mutharika.

First ladies, community activists and changemakers of all ages are moving the needle on important issues at local, national and regional levels. This work cannot be overlooked as Mrs. Trump travels to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt.

Mrs. Trump cited a desire to replicate U.S. programs “that are doing great things for children.” But to make a lasting difference, she should also consider the success that is already happening in Africa. Though the world often narrows in on the obstacles, opportunity and optimism are in abundant supply.

For example, Vivian Onano of Kenya, who fought for her right to an education, works to improve outcomes for women and young people across the continent. A youth representative for UNESCO’s Global Youth Monitoring Report among numerous other affiliations, Vivian is dedicated to creating a more inclusive future.

Ghana’s Fred Swaniker was concerned by the lack of leadership training and quality education available to young Africans. While at graduate school, he envisioned “a world-class academic institution where the most outstanding young students can develop into leaders who are passionate about the continent and eager to make an impact.” Joining forces with other like-minded individuals, the African Leadership Academy was born. This year marks ALA’s 10th anniversary.

Amid widespread sexual harassment in Egypt, Reem Fawzi launched Pink Taxi to ensure girls and women had access to safe and reliable transportation, while at the same time providing jobs for women in a male dominated industry.

These are three stories, and there are countless others that underscore the leadership, innovation and hope occurring across the continent.

As H.E. Monica Geingos, first lady of Namibia stressed in a 2017 interview:

“The Africa that you used to read about, and the stereotypes we’ve become associated with, is different from the Africa that we know. The Africa that we know is still not perfect. The Africa we know still makes itself guilty of certain stereotypes. But the Africa that we know is also developing at a much faster rate than it ever has. There is stronger leadership. And the Africa that we currently know has a youth population that is keeping leadership accountable.”

Moreover, though there are some parallels in the challenges facing children and young people in the United States, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt, there are also notable differences. And this is an important distinction.

Africa is home to the largest youth population in the world. By 2030 , the under-18 population across the continent is expected to grow to 750 million. And by 2050, 40 percent of the world’s population under the age of 18 will live in Africa.

One of the greatest resources first ladies have at their disposal is the ability to build bridges between diverse stakeholders. This includes their engagement with peers and predecessors. As we see across the work of the George W. Bush Institute’s First Ladies Initiative, sharing best practices and experiences is an important lifeline for first ladies. Communication and outreach with contemporaries provide an unparalleled chance to learn from those who are in similar positions of influence.

First lady Gertrude Mutharika of Malawi has focused on health and hygiene and the empowerment of adolescent girls. Ghana’s first lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo is improving child health and access to education. In Kenya, first lady Margaret Kenyatta launched Beyond Zero to address maternal and infant mortality and inadequate access to health services. And this year, the Organization of African First Ladies Against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA) and the African Union launched the Free to Shine campaign, a continent-wide effort that aims to “reinforce the political commitment of African nations to end childhood AIDS and keep mothers healthy.”

This perspective is important. Context and collaboration matter. To be successful in “combating … the issues that children face today,” consideration of local needs and leadership are vital to Mrs. Trump’s goal of sharing Be Best abroad. From Africa to North America, the most influential first spouses are those who keep this fact front of mind.

Natalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Bush Institute’s Women’s Initiative, the co-author of “A Role Without a Rulebook: The Influence and Leadership of Global First Ladies,” and host of the podcast Ladies, First. She wrote this for InsideSources.com.",02/10/2018
NewsDay,"Experiments on animals waste lives, time and money","Headlines about research findings imply that cures for many of our most deadly diseases are near at hand. But don’t drink the Kool-Aid. It is seldom reported that these so-called “breakthroughs” are limited to animals used in experimental settings — and will fail to translate to humans 95 percent of the time.

Using animals to attempt to understand human disease has long been the dominant practice. But experiments on animals won’t save desperately ill children or adults, and there is overwhelming evidence that they actually hinder scientific progress and put patients at risk. An immediate paradigm shift is needed.

Systematic reviews in multiple areas, including neurodegenerative disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease and stroke, cancer, diabetes and obesity, inflammation and immune responses, HIV/AIDS, addiction, trauma, and medical training, have documented the failure of animal experiments to lead to meaningful results for patients. The United States wastes almost half its research funding on archaic animal experiments. Meanwhile, more than 90 percent of highly promising basic science discoveries don’t lead to treatments for humans, and up to 89 percent of research is irreproducible — a fundamental step in science — wasting $28 billion every year.

Many animal experiments aren’t about medical breakthroughs at all. In experiments conducted at Duke University, monkeys were caged alone and kept thirsty in order to coerce them into cooperating in experiments in which they used computer touchscreens to select logos of popular commercial brands, like Pizza Hut and Nike, which had been associated with pictures of other monkeys. The reason? To attempt to show that the animals would develop a preference for brands associated with sex or social status. Taxpayers footed the bill for this nonsense.

Some experiments are so sick that they should never have been conducted at all. Eric Nestler and his team measured the time that it took for rats to have sex, cut into the males’ brains, pumped in a chemical to block their ability to process sexual pleasure and then observed whether sexual experience influenced their desire for amphetamines. He also induces depression in young mice by pitting them against aggressive older mice and watching as the young ones are physically attacked. And he torments mice for days by repeatedly shocking their feet, hanging them by their tails, and squeezing them into small tubes. Nestler has received $130 million in federal funding for these and other experiments.

Mice and rats make up 95 percent of the hundreds of millions of animals used in experimentation annually but are excluded from the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and denied the most basic protections. They are confined, genetically altered and housed in stressful isolation, and they may be burned, cut open, shocked, poisoned, starved, dehydrated, forcibly restrained, addicted to drugs, and given brain damage. But like other mammals, rats and mice experience feelings of pleasure, fear, pain and suffering.

Even for animals who are covered by the AWA, no experiment is illegal, and there is no limit to what can be done to them, no matter how painful or senseless. Institutional rubber-stamp committees approve heinous experiments based on the flimsiest justifications and often fail to enforce minimum standards.

Often, animal experimenters’ own work demonstrates that animals experience a wide range of emotions, as we do, but they fail to act ethically in the face of this information. There are significant challenges to accepting the notion of animal sentience within the scientific community. Young experimenters are indoctrinated into a professional culture that suffocates empathy and ignores animal suffering — to the detriment of both animals and humans.

A 2018 Pew Research poll found that a majority of Americans oppose the use of animals in experimentation. Those who do support it believe that the harm experienced by animals is outweighed by the benefits to humans. But the facts don’t support this belief. Analyses of experiments on animals revealed that 93 percent of the studies examined should never have been approved, because of the high levels of harm to the animals and outcomes that generated little to no benefit to humans.

Advances in human-relevant research technology hold tremendous promise for revolutionizing biomedical discovery and ushering in an age of personalized medicine. Funding agencies must redirect public funds to relevant research that has real potential to help humans. An economy of human-relevant research methods has developed, and it is rapidly outperforming animal experiments. With greater investment in exciting and innovative non-animal methods and bold policy initiatives, far more promising cures and treatments for humans can be developed. This will also alleviate the unimaginable suffering of millions of animals.

NewsDay,A bee's viral life: From Times Square to the quiet Long Island suburbs,"In his nearly two decades as a city cop, Michael Lauriano has never found himself in a sting operation — at least not like the one that had tourists, Twitter and Times Square abuzz a few weeks ago.

Lauriano, one of the NYPD’s two beekeepers, vacuumed what he estimated was 30,000 honeybees from the umbrella of a hot dog stand at 43rd Street and Broadway on Aug. 28. The bees are believed to have fallen from a nearby roof. Lauriano was called in to remove them.

Yes, he was busy as a bee that day, and the incident flew on social media, becoming a viral sensation.

Little has been said of what’s become of the bees since their brief star turn on Broadway. As it turns out, the honeymoon is far from over for Lauriano. The self-taught beekeeper adopted the horde of bees and is caring for them at his apiary in Suffolk County.

Lauriano, 40, said a love of agriculture led him to raise chickens several years ago. But it proved too demanding, he said, so he took up beekeeping instead. He earned his beekeeping badge about four years ago by watching YouTube videos and from his participation in Facebook groups. He’s held the position in the NYPD for a year. If there’s one thing about the beekeeping community, it is that it likes to share information, said the quirky cop.

“No one withholds information to have a better success at beekeeping than the next guy,” Lauriano said. “I’ve never met a beekeeper that didn’t want to share his or her mistakes or successes.”

Lauriano said his “containment” — the term he prefers to “rescue” — of the Times Square bees, took about 40 minutes and required he wear a cotton jacket, veil and gloves. It attracted an unlikely audience of about 500 onlookers, he said, and made for a scene straight out of a movie. There were no casualties and no stings reported.

“In that type of state, generally, the honeybees will not sting because they’re more concentrated on their survival,” the 18-year department veteran said. “Once a honeybee stings you, it’s death to the honeybee.”

The bee swarm that assembled on the umbrella that summer day was uncommon for that time of year, Lauriano said.

“Normally, the season for this thing called a bee swarm is in the mid- to late-spring,” he said. This is what led Lauriano and other experts to conclude the bees fell from a rooftop hive of a nearby building, likely a block away. It was the third swarm the officer said he's seen in the past year. Urban beekeeping is on the rise, according to Andrew Cote, president of the New York City Beekeepers Association. Various restaurants use the city-produced honey in their menus and cocktails, Cote said.

Lauriano used a low-suction vacuum to place the bees in a 5-gallon pail that has screening for ventilation.

Once in Suffolk, he placed the bees in a hive with a pre-existing comb so they didn’t have to build their own.

“I don’t want those bees to spend too much time going out to the wild and collecting pollen and nectar,” he said. “I’d rather them spend as much time as they can in the hive with nutrition I give them.”

Lauriano is feeding the bees a thick solution of sugar water as a substitute for nectar. They consume about a quart a day.

“There’s no question these bees are living the life,” he said, adding that in Manhattan, there are ""very limited food sources.""

The Times Square bees will likely take up permanent residence in the suburbs of Suffolk. Relocating could put the bees at risk.

“It would be too stressful to move these bees again,” Lauriano said.

He just plans to let them be.",20/09/2018
NewsDay,Short supply of EpiPens prompts concerns with back to school near,"As Michelle Cruz readies her son Benicio for the new school year, books and binders aren’t the only items on her back-to-school list.

The East Meadow family's most pressing need is actually for EpiPens, which experts say are in short supply on Long Island. EpiPens are injected into the thigh to stop severe reactions triggered by food allergies or bee stings.

Eleven-year-old Benicio, a seventh-grader, has a serious peanut allergy.

“The EpiPen is his lifeline,” Cruz, 43, said.

The device's scarcity is caused by manufacturing issues and supply disruptions, said Dr. Dean Mitchell, an immunologist and allergist with an office in Rockville Centre. Supplying this medication is a major concern, he said, including at hospitals, which are also facing shortages.

When Cruz visited her pharmacy in Westbury earlier this month to purchase EpiPens, which her son's school requires, her pharmacist told her they were on back order with no supply date.

A widespread shortage of the device could mean some children will return to school without the medication that prevents them from going into anaphylactic shock if they are exposed.

Cruz said she has enough to last her through January, when her son's medications expire.

""The good news is there are some alternatives to the EpiPen,"" Mitchell said.

Among them: Auvi-Q injector pen, made by Kaléo, which is in stock.

Patients can also request their doctors prepare ampuls of epinephrine — the same medication inside an EpiPen, which is far less expensive than Auvi-Q. The ampuls can vary in dosage and must be refrigerated. They are sensitive to sunlight, so Mitchell recommends those prescribed ampuls store them in an eyeglass case. It is the cheapest of the medical options for those who typically carry EpiPens.

“It’s a lot like patients who are diabetic that use insulin,” Mitchell said. “It’s an option that can give patients peace of mind.”

EpiPens expire 18 months from the day they are manufactured. Sales of the pens typically spike this time of year, experts say, as parents purchase required doses to leave at school and to keep with children and themselves.

The Cruz family fills two EpiPen prescriptions a year. Each prescription contains two injectors. Benicio is required to supply his school with three injectors, one to be stored and one each for him and the school nurse to carry.

There are 15 million adults and 6 million children with food allergies, Mitchell said. Of those, 2.4 million children have had a life-threatening incident, he said. Three companies currently make the epinephrine devices, and Mylan, which is manufactured by Pfizer, dominates the market, Cruz said.

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first generic version of EpiPen made by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, providing new competition that could help drive down the cost.

Last year, Cruz dealt with a steep price hike of the EpiPen. Mylan’s decision to raise the price 500 percent to more than $600 for a two-pack sparked national outrage. Cruz said she spent six times the amount to fill a single two-pack prescription than she did four years ago.

Cruz said Benicio has never required an EpiPen injection, which she attributes to carefulness and preparation. But as September quickly approaches, anxiety is setting in for the Cruz family.

“It’s unfair for families to have to worry about this,” Cruz said.",17/08/2018
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics sales jump 112% as loss shrinks,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. reported a smaller loss for the April-June period compared with a year earlier on increased sales of its rapid tests for HIV, syphilis and tropical diseases.

The Medford-based manufacturer said its loss totaled $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30 compared with the same quarter in 2017.

Sales climbed to $8.7 million, a gain of 112 percent year over year.

Chembio also announced the installation of robots on one production line in Medford. This “first automated manufacturing line ... [will] reduce cost and increase capacity” to make point-of-care tests, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

In addition, Chembio recently filed paperwork to gain authorization from the World Health Organization to transfer production of some tests to Malaysia, where it purchased a small manufacturer in 2016 for $3.5 million.

Both moves are partially in response to New York State raising the state minimum wage, starting in late 2016, company executives said in interviews last fall.

On Long Island and in Westchester County, the minimum wage rate rose from $9 to $10 per hour on Dec. 31, 2016, followed by $11 on Dec. 31. The minimum will rise another $1 each year until $15 is reached in December 2021.

Chembio had 165 employees as of Dec. 31, according to a securities filing.

The company is “expanding our commercial and manufacturing capabilities and strengthening our leadership team to further penetrate the global point-of-care diagnostics market,” CEO John J. Sperzel said in a statement.

Last month, Chembio announced that it was among three companies selected by a Swiss not-for-profit to develop a rapid test for hepatitis C virus.

The earnings announcement came after the stock market closed on Wednesday. Chembio shares fell 45 cents, or 4 percent, to close at $11 on Thursday on the Nasdaq.

In after-hours trading, the stock rose $1.30, or 12 percent, to $12.30.

NewsDay,Lessons from HIV/AIDS crisis can apply to the opioid crisis,"Over the last year, I’ve seen a growing number of comparisons between the current overdose crisis and the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic three decades ago. The parallels are certainly striking: an escalating number of deaths, particularly among younger people; a sense of hard-hit communities feeling under siege; and a growing wave of new advocates demanding action and innovative solutions.

As someone who participated in AIDS activism in the early 1990s, and now works on ending the overdose deaths, the lens through which I view these parallels begins with this insight: Every public health crisis must be understood as both a medical issue and a social issue. Health care is necessary but not sufficient to reverse the course of an epidemic. We must also fight to remove barriers to access, and tackle the policies that have put so many people in harm’s way.

As we grapple with the overdose crisis, communities and policymakers should heed three key lessons from the fight against AIDS: Stigma is the enemy, activism is the accelerator, and medicines work only when people have access to them.

There’s a growing recognition that pervasive stigma toward people with substance-use disorders hurts our ability to end overdose deaths. In the early days of the HIV epidemic, people with HIV — and the groups perceived as most likely to have HIV, such as gay men, sex workers, and people who use drugs — were widely condemned for behavior cast as immoral and illegal. The fear of HIV extended to casual contact, as though people who might have HIV represented a contagious and contaminating threat to society.

When we dehumanize people, we not only push them away through shame and isolation, we also turn to fear-based solutions by rationalizing the need to control, coerce, and punish them. We rush to support the sympathetic few cast as innocent victims, while casting others aside through discrimination or incarceration, protesting against siting life-saving services in our neighborhoods.

By the mid-1980s, a majority of Americans supported quarantining people with AIDS; today, legislators call for forcing people who use drugs into treatment. Just as many law enforcement leaders proclaim that we cannot arrest our way out of the overdose crisis, neither can we shame our way out of it. Our best solutions lie in recognizing the dignity and humanity of people who use drugs, and listening to what they tell us will help them survive.

The second lesson from the AIDS crisis builds on the first: In the face of a government slow to respond, activism is the essential accelerator for change. The federal government was notoriously slow to address the AIDS epidemic throughout most of the 1980s, due in large part to stigma and politics. The current federal response to the overdose crisis might best be characterized as “too little, too late” - neither Congress nor the Obama or Trump administration has provided anything near the amount of funding necessary to bring down the overdose rates.

Despite a flurry of legislation, we remain far off from modernizing our treatment system and building out capacity for harm reduction and recovery services. Moreover, officials are still playing catch-up, focusing energy on opioid prescribing when the leading case of overdose death is now illicit fentanyl. The AIDS crisis demonstrated that activism spurs government action and funding. We need advocacy, driven by people and families most directly affected by the overdose crisis, to demand bolder action from our elected officials to save lives.

Deaths from AIDS-related causes began to decline only in the 1990s with the advent of effective medications. With the overdose crisis, we should have a head start: Effective medications to treat opioid-use disorder were already available when overdose rates began climbing. Yet they’re woefully underutilized and difficult to access; it should be an outrage that due to cumbersome and restrictive regulations, it’s still harder to prescribe methadone or buprenorphine for treatment of opioid addiction than it is to prescribe the painkillers that exposed so many people now struggling to opioids in the first place.

When effective HIV treatment became available, health-care providers and policymakers recognized the importance of making them accessible and affordable. The Ryan White CARE Act provided not just financing, but an infrastructure of case management and social support for people with HIV; similarly, federal funding for housing programs was expanded to bring people in from the streets. We need a similarly comprehensive care and support model for people at risk of overdose, with multiple points of entry. At the federal level, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have introduced the Comprehensive Addiction Resources Emergency Act, modeled after the successful Ryan White legislation. But securing this kind of federal response will require us to learn from the AIDS crisis by rejecting stigma and embracing activism.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics tapped to develop rapid test for hepatitis C virus,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. is one of three companies in the world to be selected to develop a rapid test for the hepatitis C virus by a Swiss not-for-profit, officials announced last weekend.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV, syphilis, malaria, Ebola and other infectious diseases was chosen by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, or FIND, from proposals submitted earlier this year.

Executives said Chembio and two other businesses will develop hepatitis C tests and demonstrate their feasibility by December, when FIND is expected to choose one business to receive additional funding for further test development and clinical trials.

“Easy-to-use, accurate and affordable diagnostic tests are essential elements in the drive for hepatitis C virus elimination,” said Catharina Boehme, CEO of FIND, which is based in Geneva. “Chembio was selected based on the high sensitivity offered by its [testing] technology, together with the company’s product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.”

More than 7 million people across the globe have been infected with hepatitis C, with most in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization.

WHO reports that about 400,000 people die each year from the virus, mainly from the liver disease that it causes. Eighty percent of those who have the virus are not aware they have it.

Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said the partnership with FIND allows the company to demonstrate that its testing technology can “serve as a robust platform for the point-of-care detection of hepatitis C virus.”

The announcement came on Saturday, one day after New York State launched a plan to eliminate hepatitis C in the state with an additional $5 million in funding.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said New York's plan is the first of its kind in the country. It includes a task force of experts and increasing access to medicine and screening. Cuomo said more than 200,000 state residents are infected.

""This holistic, first-in-the-nation approach to eradicating hepatitis C is modeled on our ongoing efforts to end the AIDS epidemic, and will improve the health of many of the most vulnerable among us, including people battling drug addiction,"" Cuomo said in a statement Friday. People can contract both hepatitis C and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, through the use of contaminated needles.

Hepatitis C-related deaths have exceeded HIV-related deaths on Long Island and other regions outside of New York City since 2007, Cuomo said. ""With injecting drug use as the most common risk factor, the opioid epidemic has fueled a rise in new hepatitis C cases,"" he said.

NewsDay,Cuomo pardons 7 immigrants facing deportation for past crimes,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday pardoned seven immigrants facing possible deportation for past criminal convictions that included theft and drug possession and used the announcement to criticize President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

Cuomo said the individuals have spent years without further convictions and built lives and careers in America, but faced potential deportation because of the past convictions. State lawyers said removing the convictions that were the basis of deportation should remove the threat of deportation.

“At a time when President Trump and the federal government are waging a war on our immigrant communities, New York stands firm in our belief that our diversity is our greatest strength,"" Cuomo said. ""While President Trump engages in policies that rip children out of the arms of their mothers and tries to ramp up the deportation of New Yorkers to advance his political agenda of hate and division, we will protect our immigrant communities.""

The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said anyone in the country illegally is subject to deportation by an immigration judge and ICE would carry out that order. Several other states, including California, have pardoned immigrants facing deportation, but the federal government hasn’t always agreed to ignore a past crime even if it was pardoned.

The University of California at Davis School of Law on its website said that under recent federal law interpretations “a state’s decision to pardon, expunge, or otherwise set aside a conviction under state law will often have no effect on the federal government’s determination to use that conviction as a basis for deportation.”

Cuomo is facing a challenge for the Democratic nomination from liberal candidate Cynthia Nixon, an activist and actress, and from Republican nominee Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive in the November election. Nixon has called ICE a “terrorist organization” and wants it abolished. Molinaro has criticized part of the Trump policy, which has separated some immigrant children from their families, as un-American.

“Everything Andrew Cuomo does is for his own political benefit, regardless of whether it's right, wrong or dangerous to the public,” Molinaro spokeswoman Katherine Delgado said. “In this case, it's all about trying to out-liberal Cynthia Nixon for the September primary.""

Nixon’s spokeswoman, Lauren Hitt, called Cuomo’s action positive, but said Nixon would go further to “end the deportation pipeline” by providing driver’s licenses to immigrants in the country illegally.

NewsDay,Bayer to stop sales of birth control device tied to injuries,"The maker of a permanent contraceptive implant subject to thousands of injury reports and repeated safety restrictions by regulators said Friday that it will stop selling the device in the U.S., the only country where it remains available.

Bayer said the safety of its Essure implant has not changed, but it will stop selling the device at the end of the year due to weak sales.

The German company had billed the device as the only non-surgery sterilization method for women. As complaints mounted and demand slipped, it stopped Essure sales in Canada, Europe, South America, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has placed multiple restrictions on the device following patient reports of pain, bleeding, allergic reactions and cases where the implant punctured the uterus or shifted out of place.

In May, the FDA said doctors must show women a checklist of the device's risks before implanting it.

More than 16,000 U.S. women are suing Bayer over Essure.

One of them, Amanda Rusmisell, of Charlotte, North Carolina, said she's ""immensely thrilled"" by Bayer's action. Rusmisell said she got the device in 2008 and developed severe pain and bleeding. She took part in patient-organized rallies accusing Bayer for not disclosing potential risks and said, choking back tears, ""Our very grassroots effort has worked.""

Bayer received FDA approval to sell Essure in 2002 and promoted it as a quick and easy permanent solution to unplanned pregnancies. Essure consists of two thin-as-spaghetti nickel-titanium coils inserted into the fallopian tubes, where they spur the growth of scar tissue that blocks sperm from fertilizing a woman's eggs.

Because of the reported complaints, the FDA added its most serious warning to the device in 2016 and ordered the company to conduct a 2,000-patient study.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Friday the agency would work with Bayer to continue the study, but noted ""Bayer will not be able to meet its expected enrollment numbers"" for new patients. The study was designed to follow patients for three years to better assess complications.

More than 750,000 women worldwide have received Essure. Demand has declined in recent years and plunged 70 percent after the 2016 boxed warning, the FDA said.

Gottlieb said the FDA will continue to monitor adverse events reported to its database after Essure is removed from the market.

""I also want to reassure women who've been using Essure successfully to prevent pregnancy that they can continue to do so,"" he said. Those who think it's causing problems, such as persistent pain, should consult with their doctors, Gottlieb added.

Essure's original label warned that the device's nickel can result in allergic reactions. Its current labeling lists hives, rash, swelling and itching as possible reactions.

But many women have attributed other problems to the implant, including mood disorders, weight gain, hair loss and headaches. Those problems are listed in the current FDA labeling for the device, with the qualifier: ""It is unknown if these symptoms are related to Essure or other causes.""

Informational material Bayer supplied to doctors and patients lists potential problems and says the devices are meant to be permanent. It also says removal may require complicated surgery, including a hysterectomy, that might not be covered by insurance.

Gottlieb noted that device removal ""has its own risks.""

Diana Zuckerman, president of the nonprofit National Center for Health Research, said Essure is among medical devices approved without ""clear evidence of safety or effectiveness.""

""As a result, when thousands of women reported serious complications from Essure, there was no unbiased long-term research to refute or confirm those reports,"" Zuckerman said. ""If patients had been listened to when the first clinical trials were conducted on Essure, better research would have been conducted to determine exactly how safe and effective Essure is.""

Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a Los Angeles family planning specialist, called Bayer's move disappointing. She says most of her Essure patients have been satisfied.

""I would hope Bayer would use this opportunity to think about future research and product development,"" Brandi said. ""Being able to offer women contraception that's permanent without surgery is a really great option.""

Bayer spokeswoman Courtney Mallon said the company had no plans to re-design the device.

Kate Nicholson, of Dallas, got an Essure implant last year after she and her husband decided not to have children. She said she sympathizes with women who have had problems but said ending Essure sales is the wrong move.

""Pulling it from the market is yet another way to limit our choices about our own bodies,"" Nicholson said. ""I personally always had horrible experiences with different versions of 'the pill,' but it's still on the market and many women swear by it.""",20/07/2018
NewsDay,'It keeps us safe': An NYC bathroom set up to stem overdoses,"At an unassuming storefront on a busy Brooklyn street, people sign up to use a bathroom outfitted to try to curb an overdose crisis.

Waiting his turn, a man named Robert is frank about why he's there, instead of in one of the stairwells, parks, rooftops or porches where he has used heroin in the past.

""It keeps us safe. It keeps us from getting arrested. You feel secure here,"" says Robert, who discussed his drug use on condition that his last name not be used because he fears arrest and damage to family relationships. ""You know that someone's paying attention if you fall out in there. . . . You know they're not going to let nothing happen to you.""

As communities debate trying to stem overdose deaths by allowing safe havens for people to take heroin and other narcotics, places like this needle exchange program are quietly providing a model of sorts: bathrooms monitored by intercom, so someone can intervene to stop an overdose.

Officially, they aren't the more full-fledged and controversial facilities — often called safe injection sites — that cities including New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle are seeking to open and that already operate abroad. At the same time, some counties and cities have pre-emptively banned injection sites, and federal officials have said they're illegal.

While the discussion plays out, Robert and about a dozen other people turned up on a recent afternoon to use the bathroom off the green-and-orange drop-in room at VOCAL-NY, where work includes needle exchange, support groups and advocacy campaigns.

A sign on the bathroom allows 10 minutes ""to take care of business."" But every three minutes, a staffer checks in by intercom. If there's no response, the staffer will release the door lock and come in, ready to administer anti-overdose medication. In eight years, a few people have overdosed but all have been rescued, VOCAL says.

If not official, the restroom isn't exactly underground, either. State health department policies suggest that needle exchange program bathrooms have such safeguards.

""This bathroom is literally a response to hundreds of overdose deaths in bathrooms and streets across the city,"" Jeremy Saunders, VOCAL's co-executive director. ""You can say we're enabling people, but what we would say is: At what point do you want us to stop caring?""

Opioid drugs — including pain pills, heroin and the heavy-duty painkiller fentanyl — have spawned the deadliest epidemic of drug overdoses in U.S. history. It has killed over 47,000 people nationwide in the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent federal data.

About 100 supervised injection sites have opened in Canada, Australia and Europe over the past 30 years. At least one has been operating under the radar somewhere in the United States since 2014, according to a research paper .

The mayor of the college town of Ithaca proposed a supervised injection space in 2016. Now New York is seeking state and community approval for a one-year test of four ""overdose prevention centers"" at privately run syringe-exchange programs, and Philadelphia is looking for organizations interested in running or funding injection sites.

San Francisco initially hoped to open two sites this summer or fall but now isn't setting a time frame while working through legal issues. Seattle has budgeted $1.3 million this year to work toward launching a site, while opponents have been trying for a public vote on banning it.

A typical site would go well beyond VOCAL's bathroom, offering a space with tables or booths set up with sterile syringes, alcohol swabs and other accouterments.

As people injected themselves, staffers would watch for trouble signs and jump in with overdose-reversing drugs if needed. Workers would look for opportunities to discuss treatment, and advocates argue the caring-but-not-coercive approach helps people make changes. But the main goal is simply survival.

""You can't detox if you're dead. You can't treat someone if they're dead,"" says Kassandra Frederique, state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for less restrictive drug laws.

There has never been a reported overdose death at a supervised injection site, according to studies that say the facilities also reduce HIV infections and 911 calls for overdoses, among other problems. Researchers estimated New York's City's proposal could prevent 130 deaths and save $7 million in health care expenses per year.

""The evidence is absolutely clear that [the concept] has these great benefits,"" says injection-site researcher Alex Kral, a researcher at the RTI International research institute. ""Once people understand it, I have a hard time understanding how anyone could be against it.""

Tell that to Snohomish County Councilman Nate Nehring, who recently spearheaded a safe injection site ban in his county north of Seattle; they're also prohibited in some Snohomish cities and Pierce County, south of Seattle.

""I don't see where the compassion is in just handing someone a needle so they can shoot up heroin for the rest of their lives,"" says Nehring, a Republican. ""True compassion is saying, 'We're not going to let you live this way. . . . We're absolutely willing to help you with our resources, but you've got to get clean.'""

Members of a Colorado General Assembly committee had similar qualms when they recently nixed a proposal to allow a site in Denver.

And in Baltimore, Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen says taking steps toward an injection site without federal approval could jeopardize funding that the city can't afford to lose.

Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams has called the facilities illegal. While the Justice Department declined to comment on injection sites, Vermont U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan's office has said injection site staffers could face criminal charges and landlords forfeiture under a federal law against operating a place for narcotics use.

In New York, city special narcotics prosecutor Bridget Brennan fears injection facilities would stoke neighborhood resentment, risk legal problems and send misleading signals that drug use can be ""safe."" But Police Commissioner James O'Neill says the sites are worth trying, though the city's five district attorneys are divided on the issue.

There's no such debate at VOCAL-NY, where reminders of the dangers of drug use are as close as a framed artwork by a 28-year-old who died of an overdose.

Or as close as VOCAL activists and newlyweds Levele and Nilda Pointer, sitting beside each other.

Nilda, 46, survived three overdoses and three strokes related to her former heroin use. Levele, 50, says he'd have ""kicked the door in"" to get to a safe injection site, rather than the underpasses, condemned buildings and other locales where he used to take heroin, crack and marijuana.

He remembers times when he knew he'd gone too far and thought his heart was about to stop or burst. He felt ""total fear that I was about to die.""

""Those are moments that I would never want anyone else to live,"" he says, choking up.

""It's OK, baby,"" Nilda says. ""You're OK today.""",14/07/2018
NewsDay,FDA approves first marijuana-based prescription drug,"WASHINGTON — U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use.

The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy in patients 2 years and older. But it’s not quite medical marijuana.

The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant — but not the one that gets users high. It’s not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.

British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.

FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs. FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said his agency had supported research on cannabis-derived products “for many years.”

“This approval serves as a reminder that sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies,” Gottlieb told reporters.

The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.

Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. It doesn’t contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.

Physicians say it’s important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.

“I’m really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,” said Dr. Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic’s program for childhood epilepsy. “In the artisanal products there’s often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.”

Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.

Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.

“I preferred this to some of those other options because it’s is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,” said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.

Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer “drop” seizures — in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.

CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the United States, though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.

The immediate impact of Monday’s approval on these products is unclear.

FDA’s Gottlieb warned about the use of CBD products with “unproven medical claims.”

“The promotion and use of these unapproved products may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases,” Gottlieb said.

The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer’s. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.

Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.

Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.

“I don’t know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what’s already working,” said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation’s largest CBD companies. “I really don’t think it’s going to affect us much.”

Jackson’s group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.

A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.

For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.

The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few effective treatments. Patients experience frequent, severe seizures, in some cases more than 100 per day.

But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.

The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.

Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.

Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.

Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval. That decision is expected within 90 days.

GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances. European approval is expected in early 2019.",25/06/2018
NewsDay,Separating children from their parents at the border breaks my heart,"On Sunday, a day we as a nation set aside to honor fathers and the bonds of family, I was among the millions of Americans who watched images of children who have been torn from their parents.

In the six weeks between April 19 and May 31, the Department of Homeland Security has sent nearly 2,000 children to mass detention centers or foster care. More than 100 of these children are younger than 4 years old. The reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our borders.

I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.

Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. We also know that this treatment inflicts trauma; interned Japanese have been two times as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely than those who were not interned.

Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation, on being the nation that sends humanitarian relief to places devastated by natural disasters or famine or war. We pride ourselves on believing that people should be seen for the content of their character, not the color of their skin. We pride ourselves on acceptance. If we are truly that country, then it is our obligation to reunite these detained children with their parents - and to stop separating parents and children in the first place.

People on all sides agree that our immigration system isn’t working, but the injustice of zero tolerance is not the answer. I moved away from Washington almost a decade ago, but I know there are good people at all levels of government who can do better to fix this.

Recently, Colleen Kraft, who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics, visited a shelter run by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. She reported that while there were beds, toys, crayons, a playground and diaper changes, the people working at the shelter had been instructed not to pick up or touch the children to comfort them. Imagine not being able to pick up a child who is not yet out of diapers.

Twenty-nine years ago, my mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, visited Grandma’s House, a home for children with HIV/AIDS in Washington. Back then, at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis, the disease was a death sentence, and most babies born with it were considered “untouchables.” During her visit, Barbara - who was the first lady at the time - picked up a fussy, dying baby named Donovan and snuggled him against her shoulder to soothe him. My mother-in-law never viewed her embrace of that fragile child as courageous. She simply saw it as the right thing to do in a world that can be arbitrary, unkind and even cruel. She, who after the death of her 3-year-old daughter knew what it was to lose a child, believed that every child is deserving of human kindness, compassion and love.

NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics to sell rapid tests for Zika, other viruses in Brazil","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. plans to sell rapid tests for Zika and other viruses in Brazil, executives said Thursday. The company developed the tests with a government agency there.

The Medford-based manufacturer of diagnostic tests for HIV, syphilis and fever illnesses said it has signed a long-term agreement with Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil to commercialize the tests for Zika, dengue and chikungunya in the country.

Bio-Manguinhos is a division of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, an agency that develops and produces tests, vaccines and medicine for Brazil’s national health system. It has worked with Chembio for 14 years.

Since 2016, Chembio and Bio-Manguinhos have been working on stand-alone tests for Zika, dengue and chikungunya and tests where more than one illness can be detected. The products have undergone clinical trials and some have won governmental approvals in Brazil, the United States and Europe.

Separately in November, Chembio announced that it had signed a contract valued at up to $4.9 million with UNICEF to provide the Zika test and a companion results reader for use primarily in Africa.

Since 2015 there have been Zika outbreaks in more than 80 countries, including in the United States. The virus takes its name from the Ugandan forest where it was first identified in 1947.

Zika causes the birth defect microcephaly, in which infants have smaller-than-normal heads.

“Despite improved prevention measures to combat the viruses, the risk of incipient epidemic remains in many parts of Brazil,” Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said Thursday. The company’s tests “can become important tools to discriminate among the viruses and identify co-infected patients, as we battle these debilitating and often life-threatening viruses,” he said.

Chembio reported a loss of $6.4 million on sales of $24 million in 2017.

NewsDay,Homesteading on Long Island for a self-sufficient life,"Every autumn, after picking apples at an orchard either on Long Island or upstate, I bring them home, bake pies and make applesauce. In December, I make limoncello to give as gifts and enjoy over the holidays, and every week I make a batch of Greek yogurt. For the past 15 years, I’ve had an ever-brewing container of kombucha on my kitchen counter, and there is always compost in the backyard. I grow an array of vegetables and, summer before last, I cajoled my family to spend a (somewhat miserable) day canning tomatoes under the hot August sun.

I thought I was all Mother-Earthy, but the truth is, after meeting some suburban homesteaders here on Long Island, I laugh to think of how proud I’d been of my back-to-basics endeavors, which take, on average, mere minutes per week.

JOSEPHINE FAN

PATCHOGUE

Josephine Fan, of Patchogue, walks the walk. After waking every morning at 7:30 with her daughters, Sophie, 4, and Martha, 1, the trio heads outdoors. They feed and water the ducks, and collect their eggs. While the children play, Fan patrols the gardens, inspecting plants to ensure they are healthy. As she makes her rounds, trusty pruners in hand, she takes care of broken or diseased plant parts, and the children pick vegetables, berries and other fruit.

“Sometimes kids can be picky,” said the martial arts teacher, who owns a martial arts school in Bay Shore with her husband, Adam Pilipshen, 40. “But if they pick it from the backyard, they eat it.” Sophie, for instance, refused to taste asparagus until she saw them poke out of the ground in the garden. “She was curious, so we cooked them, and now she eats them,” said Fan, 28.

Martha’s new job is collecting eggs from the ducks. “As long as chores are food-based, I feel they’re motivated,” she said.

After morning chores are done, Fan and the girls head inside to make breakfast, which right now means fresh eggs, as their nine ducks each lay one egg per day between April and November. Fan also hatches some of the eggs and sells the ducklings.

She is originally from Fresh Meadows, Queens, and attended Stony Brook University, where she majored in business management and psychology. After superstorm Sandy in 2012, her parents asked her to check on their rental property in Patchogue.

“A pipe had burst, and the entire interior was destroyed. There were mushrooms growing out of the carpet,” Fan recalled. Unable to sell, she decided to move in and take it over herself. As she made repairs, it struck her that life could turn on a dime, and she decided it would be best to become self-sufficient on the one-acre property. “I came out here, and everything was sand. The lawn was being kept alive by chemicals, by artificial means,” she said. “So I fired the landscapers, and now I maintain everything myself. I just have someone mow. I have them leave the clippings on the lawn as mulch . . .”

Fan said that when she moved in “the soil had no worms, there were no bugs. Now, just four years later, every summer I’m the only house on my block that gets swarms of bees and butterflies. It makes me feel more secure, but in the grand scheme of things, it’s important that it helps the Earth.”

Fan’s parents, who live for a portion of the year in Fresh Meadows, own farms in Costa Rica, so she grew up exposed to agriculture. “My parents maintain the forest on their farms and plant trees, and they got into permaculture, so my dad started shoving books at me,” she said. After reading and learning about the agricultural system that’s modeled after natural ecosystems, Fan said she came to an epiphany: “It made a lot of sense to me as far as how to cultivate the land for food and keep it healthy. If you plant in a way that plants are companionable, you can plant closer together.”

Next, Fan decided to eschew the use of pesticides and herbicides and found that poultry could handle the jobs of both — plus provide eggs. “I’ve had ducks and chickens, but I prefer Muscovy ducks because they’re quiet and they also eat a lot of pests that chickens and regular ducks don’t touch, like gypsy moth caterpillars. They also eat ticks, slugs, snails, pretty much anything that moves, and they eat weeds,” she said, adding facetiously that she has to “fight them” for dandelions, which her husband likes to eat. As a bonus, ducks fertilize the soil as they roam.

There are plenty of other bonuses, too, Fan said: “I don’t have to buy food or store it. I can just go outside and get what I need. I don’t understand using land for manicured lawns when it could be used to produce food for my family so I don’t have to go to the store.”

The family eats seasonally, supplementing with purchased red meat and dairy, and Fan freezes some food. The family’s lifestyle isn’t without its hardships, however. Fan’s edible plants, 75 percent of which are perennial, sometimes get viruses, and the weather can wreak havoc on crops and fowl. Last winter, Fan lost two ducks to frostbite. “They took a swim and didn’t dry off in time,” she explained, adding that the ducks ended up on the dinner table. “There are always lessons to be learned. This year I’m not going to give them their pool during winter time.”

Time constraints pose another challenge. “When my daughters were younger, I didn’t have enough time to do it all,” Fan said. “You get into the zone when you’re working in the garden, and if you keep getting interrupted, it’s hard to finish.” As she speaks, Martha shrieks, as if on cue, and Fan laughs. “Now they’re out with me for three or four hours playing while I’m working, so it’s easier.”

Pilipshen, her husband, is an instructional designer at Nassau Community College by day, as well as a martial arts instructor. “He has no opinion of all this whatsoever,” said Fan, who is the sole farmer in the household. “He does chop wood, but to him, this is weird; he grew up upper middle-class, he’s used to having a lawn.”

Still, she values self-sufficiency. “Maybe it’s in my head, but there’s security in knowing that if things go bad, we’re not completely lost,” she said. “I have a wood-burning stove, so I’m not worried if we’re out of power for two weeks, or out of heat. I have food in the backyard and a method to cook it. I live right next to a lake, so I have water. I can provide for my family in the event anything goes wrong, and even if nothing goes wrong, I’m saving a lot of money. What else do I need?”

NICK SARIN

MANORVILLE

Nick Sarin, of Manorville, is saving money, too, but that’s not what motivates him.

“A lot of it has to do with getting back to old ways, growing our own food and being connected with that food from the growing process,” said Sarin, 35, who is originally from Wantagh.

Sarin, who by day works in the commercial refrigeration field, is a modern-day Renaissance man during his off-hours: Along with his wife, Pamela, 36, he’s a beekeeper, vermicomposter (composting with worms), home brewer and fermenter, grower of fruit, vegetables, herbs and mushrooms. He also raises chickens and rabbits, and he fishes, hunts and forages for weeds and mushrooms.

Each day when he returns from work, Sarin feeds the six chickens the couple share with their neighbors, waters the plants and trees, and feeds the rabbits, which he is planning to breed for meat. Sarin has even tapped his maple trees. “We don’t get very much syrup, but there’s no comparison to store-bought,” he said.

The couple, who live in Pamela’s childhood home with their daughter, Olivia, 3, and son, John, 1, both have master’s degrees in education. Pamela is a former teacher who’s currently a stay-at-home mom.

They practice no-till gardening, opting instead to build upon the existing soil. “We till just one time to loosen soil, then add a layer of wood chips, and mulch, mulch, mulch, and then plant. It’s building nutritious soil and not disturbing the microbes,” Sarin said.

Immediately after moving into the house three years ago, the Sarins began building a 40-foot-by-40-foot garden on their 1.4-acre lot. They planted a large strawberry patch, tomatoes and a small orchard of nearly 20 apple, cherry, pear, peach and plum trees, plus some lesser-known fruit trees, like medlar, which was common during the Middle Ages. The persimmon-like fruit is considered ripe when it’s about to rot, Sarin said, adding that he has plans to graft it onto a crabapple.

Growing up on Nassau’s South Shore, Sarin said he enjoyed hikes and gardening. “I spent a lot of time with friends at the beach, going fishing and watching sunsets, and I got into hives — not because of the honey, but because I like bees. I just enjoy watching them doing their practice flights.”

Currently, Sarin is beginning his sixth year as a beekeeper and “bounces between one and three hives,” he said, adding that he lost hives over the winter because, he believes, of a problem with the queens.

Losses are tough, Sarin said, but often are unpreventable. “Weather is really hard on the bees. A few years ago, we had a very early bloom, and the hive was just not ready. When trees bloom in January or February, that shoots the whole nectar source” for the season.

“A couple of years ago, we had a drought for an entire month,” he recalls, “and that’s hard on the bees because they go into their honey stores, and they’ll consume those that they would otherwise be using to get through part of the winter with.”

Sarin also forages for mushrooms and weeds. He makes dandelion wine using Pamela’s great-uncle’s recipe, tea from stinging nettle he finds, and brings back garlic mustard, Japanese wine berries and usnea, a medicinal lichen also known as old man’s beard.

Time isn’t always on his side, but he’s trying to change that.

“It’s very hard with a job and raising a family,” Sarin said. “My biggest frustration is there’s too much to do, and too little time. Since we’re still new at the house, a lot of the work is cleaning up and planting new things. We’re trying to get it to the point where it’s low-maintenance because I’m not going to get any younger, so let me put in the time now, while I can.”

MICHAEL FIORENTINO

EAST YAPHANK

Michael Fiorentino, of East Yaphank, is just 21 years old, but you won’t find the Penn State University graduate student binge-watching Netflix or playing video games. “No time for that!” said the modern goat herder, who prefers to spend his mornings and evenings with his buck and milking his six does. When there are kids, most of the milk is bottle-fed to them — three times a day — and in between, he cleans their pens, makes sure their hay feeders are full and freshens their bedding. There are chickens and rabbits to tend, as well. When he does have some free time, Fiorentino likes to kayak, hunt and fish, and he makes a small amount of goat’s milk cheese and soap for personal use and to give as gifts.

You wouldn’t know it, but Fiorentino wasn’t raised on a farm, although when he was a boy, his father had a couple of pet goats and pigs. He’s doing all this in the backyard of his childhood home, which sits on a half acre, and where he lives with his parents, Joe and Barbara, and sisters, Nicole, 23, and Jessica, 19. Fiorentino, who holds a bachelor’s degree in animal science from SUNY Cobleskill, is currently studying agricultural and extension education, and his family has stepped in to help out while he’s away during the school year.

Fiorentino credits the Suffolk County Cooperative Extension in Yaphank and 4-H Club, the youth development and mentoring program, with nurturing his interest. “When I was 9 years old, my parents got me involved with 4-H at Suffolk County Farm, and I started working with dairy cattle, and then, a few years later, with goats, which I was able to bring home and keep in the backyard.”

At age 16, his Cooperative Extension work led him to goat dairy farmer Hal Goodale in Riverhead, and Goodale, in turn, introduced him to John and Maribeth Andresen, a veterinarian and retired nurse, respectively, who own Foxglove Farm in Aquebogue, and the couple guided the fledgling farmer.

“I’ve done a lot of work with Maribeth,” Fiorentino, said. “She took me to goat shows around the country, introduced me to a lot of people, and helped me with making decisions and buying, selling and breeding goats.”

When Fiorentino aged out of 4-H, he continued on as a leader and mentor, became involved in the organization’s goat program on the state level and the N.Y. State Youth Goat Advisory Committee, and is currently assistant superintendent for the N.Y. State Fair in Syracuse. But he acknowledges he won’t be able to continue at this pace once he graduates from school. “Right now, I’m trying to maintain and even downsize a little,” he said. “I’m trying to make plans for after school because I don’t know where I’ll end up. I’d like to keep the goats, but there are some 4-H members I’d like to see take on more responsibility with them, and I’d be happy if they took them home when I move away.”",23/05/2018
NewsDay,'The Boys in the Band' returns to Broadway to mark its 50th anniversary,"“I remember seeing it and kind of being scared by it,” says Brian Hutchison.

“I thought, ‘We’ve come so far — why do we want to go do that thing again?’ ” Tuc Watkins recalls.

“I was very reluctant,” says Michael Benjamin Washington.

But that was before these three actors began rehearsals for the first Broadway production of Mart Crowley’s groundbreaking play about gay life in New York. “Boys” debuted at a tiny Off-Broadway theater in 1968 to critical acclaim, spawning a film version — and controversy. Now, 50 years later, two-time Tony Award-winning director Joe Mantello is encouraging theatergoers — as his actors did — to reconsider this tale.

The limited-run production, now in previews and opening at the Booth Theatre on May 31, features an impressive ensemble cast. The nine men — including Jim Parsons (“Big Bang Theory”), Zachary Quinto (“Star Trek”), Matt Bomer (“White Collar”) and Andrew Rannells (“Girls,” “Book of Mormon”) — are notable not just for their name recognition. They’re also all gay. And out. And that, it seems, changes everything about this show.

Back in 1968, Crowley’s “Boys” caused a sensation, daring to present a cross-section of gay men gathered at a New York apartment to celebrate a friend’s birthday. There’s Michael, a sharp-tongued neurotic (Parsons) hosting a cynic (Quinto), all-American underachiever (Bomer), Lothario (Rannells), jock math teacher (Watkins), quiet clerk (Washington), hustler (Charlie Carver) and flamboyant decorator (Robin de Jesús). Enter a surprise guest — a WASP-y attorney (Hutchison) who’s straight . . . maybe.

“The party starts out fun,” says Watkins. “Until it’s not.”

Very not. The script — while covering issues that still plague gay men — unleashes a torrent of booze- and drug-fueled barbs, snipes and shade.

“You show me a happy homosexual and I’ll show you a gay corpse,” says Michael.

It’s lines like that — and other slurs — that earned the show a bad rap. Yes, it was great to finally see gay men as fully realized characters, not — as was then standard — freak-show villains or cheap comic relief. But did they all need to be so unhappy?

Gathered in a lower lobby at the Booth, cast members Watkins, Hutchison and Washington are pondering what makes this “Boys” version feel and sound so different. There haven’t been significant rewrites — just minor edits to condense the original two-act play into one act.

Parsons, they agree, is a game-changing host.

“Jim has such an approachability, a light touch and humor at the beginning that allows the audience in,” says Hutchison.

But it’s not all about Parsons. He tripped and fractured his foot May 12, requiring his understudy, Matt McGrath, to temporarily replace him for two performances.

It’s their shared orientation that seems to carry the most weight.

“There’s a support and empathy [within the cast] that’s just sort of understood, even if you don’t know everybody’s specific story,” says Hutchison.

That dynamic can lead in unexpected directions.

“I asked one of our understudies a question about his wife, and he said, ‘Hhhhhhow did you know I had a wife?’—as if I’d outed him as a straight person,” says Watkins. “I thought, ‘Yeah, take that,’ ” he jokes, and the others laugh. “I didn’t mean anything by it — it’s just that so much of my career was spent hiding my sexuality,” says the actor, whose resume includes stints on “One Life to Live” and “Desperate Housewives.” He found it refreshing when the tables were inadvertently turned.

Not that straight actors can’t play these roles. Hetero actor Cliff Gorman played flamboyant Emory in the original production and film. By today’s standards, his comic mincing seems off. Over-the-top. But ultimately, gay, straight — does it matter who plays what?

“I think it does — now,” says Robin de Jesüs, who plays Emory in the current run. “When you’re out and gay, no one wants to see you play straight. They say they can ‘see the gay,’ quote unquote,” he says. (That’s got to be frustrating, given that no one seemed to mind “seeing the straight” in Gorman’s performance. He won an Obie.) So that leaves gay actors like de Jesús with gay roles, unless straight guys get those, too.

The presentation of realistic gay stories doesn’t stop at casting. Increasingly, marginalized groups — women, people of color, members of the trans community — have been advocating for more of a presence in director’s chairs, TV writer’s rooms and the like, to help authentically create their stories from the ground up.

That’s the next battle, one that the boys in this particular “band” probably couldn’t have imagined back in 1968.

“Joe Mantello, our director, always said, ‘No matter what happens in this play . . . remember that these guys all love one another,’” de Jesús recalls. “I think that shows. We’re all gay and proud, and have a sense of community because of one another. Maybe that is what will make our version special.”",17/05/2018
NewsDay,LIRR access to Manhattan’s East Side is coming into view,"First of two parts.

Standing amid the noise and grime of construction, deep below Park Avenue and Grand Central Terminal, one can almost see thousands of commuters heading down towering new escalators or glass elevators to board Long Island Rail Road trains.

Riding in a heavy-duty golf cart past stacks of concrete and steel, one can almost hear the trains rumbling through the new tunnels under Queens toward Manhattan’s East Side.

If the East Side Access project goes as planned — and that’s an enormous if — we’re four and a half years away from a new LIRR terminal 160 feet below Grand Central.

But it will be much more than a pretty terminal and new tracks and platforms.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

East Side Access is one of the region’s most important undertakings. While long derided for its rising cost, now more than $11 billion, delays and seemingly endless stream of contracts and change orders, the project’s end is in sight. And it’s up to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Long Island Rail Road, Amtrak and state officials to work together and make sure it is finished without further delay, or greater cost overruns. MTA officials now say it’s expected to open by the end of 2022.

This is a project known for awful missteps. Early estimates, after all, put the cost at $4.3 billion, and the opening date at 2009.

What’s unknown about it is what’s unseen — what’s happening underground, beneath the elevated N subway train, far below the busy five-lane Northern Boulevard in Queens, and even the E train’s path below that. For years, hundreds of workers have constructed a tunnel there, freezing the ground around it to give it stability to handle the weight of trains, trucks and more trains above it.

Now, that tunnel is a hive of activity — the connection between the maze of tracks at the Harold Interlocking in Sunnyside and the new tracks and terminal being built under Grand Central. Small vehicles and trucks cart concrete and steel through the tunnels’ muddy, unfinished paths, under the East River and Roosevelt Island. Upon reaching Manhattan, they turn south under Park Avenue.

And then, the workers, equipment, supplies and visitors reach the cavernous end — a two-level, eight-track terminal. There, the train platforms, curved-beam ceilings and even some of the 17 escalators are in place. Above the tracks is the frame of a future concourse for the LIRR, a spot that could become just as important to Long Islanders as Penn Station.

But East Side Access’s impact goes far beyond the needs of LIRR riders. This project will help to modernize the region’s transit system, grow its economy and expand opportunities for the city and suburbs alike. It will fill the desperate need for redundancy, especially at a time when Amtrak’s East River tunnels are old and unreliable, a situation worsened by damage from superstorm Sandy. It will provide a boost to the East Side, which Long Islanders will look to as a new source of work and play. It will improve signals, safety and infrastructure in critical parts of our transit system. It will provide a direct and much faster link to JFK Airport’s AirTrain. And it will help the Island by giving residents an easier commute, making it more attractive to young people and families, and providing its businesses a new pool of workers when New York City residents will be able to commute east with regular, reliable train service.

The LIRR provides more than 300,000 rides on an average weekday. When East Side Access is done, and combined with the finished double-track and third-track projects on Long Island, the railroad’s capacity will increase by a staggering 45 percent.

Nonetheless, East Side Access is seen as the MTA’s ugliest monster, long criticized for its seemingly endless timetable and constantly growing budget, and for a multitude of valid and troubling concerns.

The MTA didn’t handle this project well from the beginning, from the original, unrealistic time and cost estimates to the dozens of contracts that required dozens of change orders, from the lack of coordination and oversight to the silly mistakes — most recently, the concourse steel beams that were the wrong size. And then there’s Amtrak, which was part of the project from the start because it owns the Harold Interlocking and Sunnyside Yards, but has been difficult to work with, and never has prioritized the effort the way it should.

Indeed, there will be a lot to learn from what was done badly.

On top of all of that, the MTA also hasn’t done a good job “selling” the project — explaining to anyone who doesn’t live in Nassau or Suffolk counties why they should care.

But they should care. And it’s time for everyone to get on board. The LIRR is about to become the proud owner of a new terminal, and it needs to devote the personnel and the time to be ready for that undertaking and to do it well. The MTA needs to get beyond the problems of years gone by and spend the next four years finishing East Side Access on its current timetable and at its current budget. The project now has the right leadership in MTA chief development officer Janno Lieber. Lieber came to the MTA one year ago, from managing the redevelopment of the World Trade Center complex. He knows how to get projects done, and is bringing the same expertise and urgency to East Side Access.

And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may have to work his magic, too. He did it in finally getting the Second Avenue subway open and getting the third track approved in 2017. A similar public push from Cuomo could be enough to make everyone pay attention and get the job done.

For two decades, East Side Access has been synonymous with the worst of the LIRR and the MTA. But with the right leadership, partnership, and urgency, it won’t be that way for long.

There’s a light at the end of the East Side Access tunnel — and it’s a game-changer for the region.

NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics posts higher revenue, narrower loss in quarter","Shares of Chembio Diagnostics Inc. climbed Thursday after the Medford maker of diagnostic tests posted higher revenue and a narrower net loss in the first quarter.

The stock rose 3.8 percent to close at $8.15 Thursday. Shares were trading at $6.95 12 months ago.

The maker of tests for diseases such as Zika and HIV posted revenue of $7.7 million for the period ended March 31, up from $5.4 million in the 2017 period.

Its net loss shrank almost 60 percent to $652,343 compared with the year-earlier loss of $1.6 million. Diluted loss per share was 5 cents versus a diluted loss per share of 13 cents a year earlier.

Chembio chief executive John Sperzel attributed the improved results to better performance overall and important business partnerships.

""We started the year with continued execution in our core business, advancement of product development initiatives and progress on key technology collaborations, including those with AstraZeneca and LumiraDx,"" he said.

Costs related to research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, a 10.2 percent decline from the year-earlier quarter.",10/05/2018
NewsDay,Northwell outreach effort targets ‘hot zones’ of HIV infection,"New technology involving “heat maps” that illustrate high concentrations of HIV infection are helping the Northwell Health system better target outreach in African-American communities, officials with the health network said Thursday.

Northwell’s Center for AIDS Research and Treatment in Manhasset has targeted several so-called hot zones of HIV infection — all communities with significant African-American populations — as areas for outreach. The center’s director named Hempstead, Westbury and Huntington Station as hot zones for HIV, along with the borough of Queens.

These areas are being targeted by the center for prevention, treatment and education, said Dr. Joseph McGowan, who introduced his heat maps during a morning news briefing.

African-Americans are 17 times more likely to die of HIV than their white counterparts, and constitute more than 50 percent of HIV cases nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Blacks additionally are more likely to be unemployed and have housing and food insecurities — risky situations that surprisingly track with higher HIV infection rates, McGowan said.

“The epidemic is still expanding, but at a slower rate. Therefore there are not fewer, but more people living with HIV on Long Island every year,” he said.

About 130,000 people of all races have tested positive for HIV statewide, according to data from the state Department of Health.

The New York State HIV/AIDS Annual Surveillance Report, which was posted on the Health Department’s website in December, shows 5,815 people in Nassau and Suffolk living with diagnosed HIV infection. Of those, 2,744 people, including inmates, were in Nassau County. That figure encompasses 1,170 people who are HIV positive but do not have AIDS, and 1,574 with the full-blown disease.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In Suffolk, the total, including inmates, is listed at 3,071 of which 1,328 are living with HIV but do not have AIDS, and 1,743 who have the immune deficiency disease.

Islandwide, however, there is an estimated 1,000 people who are probably infected with the virus but don’t know it, and many probably reside in the hot zones, McGowan said.

“That’s the number we are trying to focus on. How do we find those people because they are the source of new infections,” he said.

The aim is to get people on antiretroviral therapy, the drug regimen that not only combats HIV but is capable of suppressing the virus to nondetectable levels in the blood. Once that happens, the person is no longer able to transmit it to others. It is not a cure.

Stopping viral transmission in these communities abides by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s larger effort to end the HIV epidemic in New York by 2020.

Jeffrey Kemp, who resided in Glen Cove and Roosevelt before recently moving to New York City, says he religiously takes his antiretroviral medication and keeps track of his medical appointments and bloodwork on a State Health Department app called Get, designed for people with HIV. He checks it first thing every morning.

Kemp, who spoke at the briefing, was diagnosed as HIV positive in 2002 while residing in Kentucky. He said he had received his best medical care at Northwell. “Being here I feel like a person who matters,” he said.

Jessica Clark, a community outreach professional and member of McGowan’s team, goes to churches and other venues in minority communities, carrying messages of prevention and healthy lifestyles.

She told the briefing that people at risk for HIV because of unsafe behaviors — but who are not infected — are eligible for the drug therapy called PrEP. The drug’s acronym stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is a combination therapy of two medications, which can prevent HIV infection, she said.

Another is PEP, which stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. It is made up of antiretroviral medications that can be taken after possible exposure to HIV. The therapy can prevent infection, Clark said.",26/04/2018
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics in collaboration with UK company,"Medical test developer Chembio Diagnostics Inc. in Medford announced Wednesday a collaboration that it said would lead to new tests for undisclosed infectious diseases.

Chembio said it “has entered into a collaboration agreement” with LumiraDx, a British health care company focused on software and data. The agreement calls for LumiraDx to pay Chembio an unspecified amount “to develop new point-of-care diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.”

Previously, Chembio has developed and sold rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika, malaria and other tropical diseases.

Under the agreement, Chembio will manufacture and sell reagents, or substances used to detect the presence of disease, to LumiraDx and also receive royalty payments on the sale of tests and other products.

“Through our joint efforts, we expect the new products to provide access to a broader customer base,” said Chembio CEO John Sperzel. “In addition, we anticipate expanding our product portfolio by applying reagent biomarkers funded through this agreement” to Chembio tests.

He said there is no ""end date"" to the collaboration agreement.

LumiraDx CEO Ron Zwanziger said working with Chembio will produce “commercial opportunity for both firms.”

LumiraDx, which has an office in Waltham, Massachusetts, was begun in 2014 by executives who had started companies in medical testing and information technology.

NewsDay,Barbara Bush’s compassion spoke volumes,"The death of Barbara Bush at age 92 on Tuesday has led to an understandable focus on her role as the wife of one American president and the mother of another. Her 73-year marriage to George H.W. Bush, the longest union in presidential history, was indeed remarkable.

But in the end, it was some of Barbara Bush’s own actions that might have mattered more.

In March 1989, shortly after her husband took office, she visited a pediatric AIDS care center in Washington. There, she cradled an infant with HIV, which causes AIDS, and hugged an adult with AIDS. Her simple gestures and message of compassion resonated powerfully at a time of hysteria, when many people incorrectly thought they could get AIDS simply by being near someone infected with the dreaded virus.

She raised more than $1 million for literacy programs and with her husband started a foundation to raise funds for research on leukemia, the disease that killed their oldest daughter, Robin, when she was 3.

While her candor led to the occasional intemperate remark, Barbara Bush will be remembered as a fiercely supportive political matriarch whose empathy spoke louder than her words.",18/04/2018
NewsDay,5 myths about the Veterans Affairs health care,"Americans have been hearing for years that the health-care system run by the Department of Veterans Affairs is in crisis.

In 2014 came charges that officials at the Phoenix VA and other facilities had altered or destroyed records to hide evidence of lengthy wait times for appointments. Most recently, David Shulkin, the former VA secretary who left amid a scandal over luxury travel expenses charged to taxpayers, contended that the president fired him for not moving quickly enough to privatize the system.

In truth, misconceptions mar the debate about how veterans’ health care actually works.

Myth No. 1

The claims process is slow because of VA bureaucrats.

Citing “bureaucracy run amok,” Rep. Jackie Walorksi (R-Ind.) sponsored a bill in 2014 to empower the VA secretary to, as she put it, “fire senior officials who aren’t up to the job” of reducing the department’s backlog of disability claims. Discussing his articles about the backlog for the Center for Investigative Reporting, Aaron Glantz concluded that “the problem is that the VA bureaucracy at the highest levels is so dysfunctional that they’ve been having difficulties staffing up to meet these needs even when Congress gives them the resources.”

Politicians and journalists are not alone in blaming VA bureaucrats for the long delays many veterans face in establishing eligibility for VA health care — veterans also point to the bureaucracy. The latest department data shows that as of the end of last year, more than 75,000 veterans were waiting for VA to decide whether they qualified for health care and other benefits based on a service-related disability.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Yet while VA has streamlined its claims process — the backlog is down from more than 600,000 five years ago — the fundamental reason for these delays isn’t bureaucratic inefficiency. The process certainly could be more administratively efficient, but it is ultimately Congress that makes it so difficult for many veterans to get VA care. Because of laws that strictly limit eligibility, veterans must show that they are either poor or suffer from some specific degree of disability related to their military service to qualify for many health-care services as well as pension benefits. The requirement to litigate different health conditions — such as, say, whether a veteran’s hearing loss is a result of artillery fire or exposure to rock and roll — is the ultimate reason the VA claims process is prolonged and often humiliating to vets.

Myth No. 2

Wait times to see a doctor at VA are an exceptional problem.

Much attention has focused on how long veterans enrolled in VA must wait to see a doctor or receive a treatment, and on instances when VA employees altered the numbers to make wait times look shorter. “The VA, it’s a disaster,” Donald Trump told a veterans group during the 2016 presidential campaign. “. . . To see a doctor, sometimes it takes six and seven days, and then you finally get there and the doctor is gone on vacation.” “NBC Nightly News” reported in January that “VA hospitals face renewed scrutiny over lengthy wait times.”

Yet the coverage of this scandal has been deeply misleading. The key question that often goes unanswered is: compared with what? A 2015 study by the RAND Corp. concluded that, in general, “wait times at the VA for new patient primary and specialty care are shorter than wait times reported in focused studies of the private sector.” In a 2013 survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that supports independent research on health-care issues, 1 in 4 Americans reported that they had to wait six or more days for an appointment with their primary-care physician, even when they were “sick or needed care.” Most major VA medical centers, by contrast, now offer same-day urgent primary-care and mental-health-care appointments. Current enrollees seeking nonurgent primary care can typically get an appointment in three to seven days.

Myth No. 3

VA delivers mediocre care or worse.

It’s not hard to find instances of outrageous deficiencies in the system. A 2014 Fox News op-ed by Marc Siegel, a doctor, held that its hospitals “are fallback places, providing second tier medical care.” Individual VA hospitals have in recent years made headlines for allegedly keeping secret an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, exposing patients to hepatitis and HIV, and failing to protect patients from inept doctors.

But compared with the rest of the U.S. health-care system, VA’s performance is pretty impressive. As a Rand review of the literature concluded, study after study has found that the “quality of care delivered by VA is generally equal to or better than care delivered in the private sector.” This has been true since VA underwent a structural transformation in the mid-1990s. Since then, health-care researchers, as well as mainline veterans’ service organizations, have consistently hailed its pioneering use of electronic medical records, adherence to evidence-based medicine, patient safety measures, and high levels of care coordination and scientific research.

The bipartisan Commission on Care, of which I was a member, found the quality of VA’s behavioral health programs “largely unrivalled.” In many areas, VA offers specialized polytrauma and rehabilitative care for veterans that cannot be obtained at any price elsewhere. Don’t forget, part of the reason you hear so many negative stories about VA health care is that it receives far more scrutiny than the rest of the health-care system, including from two standing committees in Congress, an inspector general, veterans service organizations and a highly engaged press.

Myth No. 4

VA should offer patients maximum choice in doctors.

“Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center,” Trump said in 2016. Advocates from the president to Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. John McCain and the Koch brothers salute the idea that veterans should have more “choice” in the health care they receive. In a rare act of bipartisanship, Congress recently passed and Trump signed into law the Veterans Choice Improvement Act, which allows VA patients to continue to seek care from private doctors, subject to certain conditions.

But choice comes at the cost of other important values, such as providing coordinated, high-quality, cost-effective care. The Commission on Care found that giving VA enrollees the ability to choose any private doctor for any treatment (which the recent legislation does not do) would be fantastically expensive to taxpayers unless it involved all sorts of bureaucratic cost controls. Sending veterans to other providers could also threaten the viability of VA hospitals and clinics, many of which already face rapid shrinking in their patient populations, owing to the passing of the World War II generation. If VA hospitals wind up closing, that would leave veterans with less, not more, choice in doctors.

Myth No. 5

Allowing veterans to see private doctors means ‘privatizing’ VA.

Many conservatives want to see VA outsource most of its care to the private sector. One example is Concerned Veterans for America, an organization supported by the Koch brothers, that is ideologically hostile to government-provided health care and has a great deal of influence within the Trump administration. Some large, integrated, private health systems, such as the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, advocate for at least partial privatization of VA, presumably because it would bring more business their way.

Sensitive to this debate, VA supporters bristle: “I work very closely with the major veterans organizations,” Sanders said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” two weeks ago. “. . . And what they say is they want to strengthen the VA, not dismember it, not privatize it.” Shulkin, the recently dismissed VA chief, along with many veterans service organizations, has warned of creeping privatization.

Yet not all calls for VA to make better use of private providers amount to “privatization,” as some liberals and public employee unions claim. VA has a long history of partnering with private medical schools and purchasing care in the community. Especially in rural areas, VA often lacks the facilities and personnel to offer vets timely, convenient, high-quality care. In such circumstances, joining with local private providers to create integrated networks of care makes both clinical and fiscal sense.

NewsDay,Highly drug-resistant gonorrhea case confirmed by U.K. health officials,"A super-resistant strain of gonorrhea has been reported in the United Kingdom following warnings from global public health officials that the common sexually transmitted disease is becoming more difficult to treat.

Health officials in England said it is the first time that a case of gonorrhea could not be treated successfully with antibiotics that are commonly used to cure it.

Earlier this year, a man, who was not named, sought treatment there for symptoms that he developed about a month after he had sexual contact with a woman in Southeast Asia, according to a case report from Public Health England. The bacterial infection was treated with two antibiotics, azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but subsequent tests still came back positive for the disease, the officials said.

“This is the first time a case has displayed such high-level resistance to both of these drugs and to most other commonly used antibiotics,” Dr. Gwenda Hughes, who leads the sexually transmitted infection section at Public Health England (PHE), said Wednesday in a statement.

Gonorrhea, which is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases around the world.

Each year, there are an estimated 78 million cases across the globe — about 820,000 of which are reported in the United States, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.

But public health officials said it is becoming more and more resistant to drugs.

Dr. Teodora Wi, medical officer of human reproduction at WHO, said in a news release last year that the bacteria that cause gonorrhea are highly intelligent, explaining that “every time we use a new class of antibiotics to treat the infection, the bacteria evolve to resist them.”

It’s not certain how the patient in England contracted the super-resistant strain. Although he had contact with a woman in Asia, he also had one female partner in the United Kingdom, according to the recent report from Public Health England. She avoided infection.

Following treatment, a throat swab revealed that the man’s infection was still present.

The patient was then treated intravenously with another antibiotic called ertapenem and preliminary tests show that the medication may be working.

He will be tested again next month.

“We are following up this case to ensure that the infection was effectively treated with other options and the risk of any onward transmission is minimized,” Hughes, with Public Health England, said in the statement. “PHE actively monitors, and acts on, the spread of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea and potential treatment failures, and has introduced enhanced surveillance to identify and manage resistant strains of infection promptly to help reduce further spread.”

David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said that the report “is one more confirmation of our greatest fear: drug-resistant gonorrhea spreading around the globe.”

“Here in the U.S. and around the globe, we have to take drug-resistant gonorrhea seriously in order to invest in finding new cures and preventing infections,” he said, according to CNN. “Working together, funding must be radically increased to combat this and other life-threatening STDs.”

Oftentimes, there are no signs or symptoms associated with gonorrhea but, when symptoms do occur, they can include pain while urinating, abnormal discharge from the genitals and, with women, pain during sexual intercourse, among other things, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Medical experts warn that when the condition is not treated, it can sometimes lead to infertility in both men and women, other infections throughout the body, as well as an increased risk of HIV/AIDS.

The Mayo Clinic recommends that people and their sexual partners use prophylactics and undergo regular STD screenings to monitor for infections.

“It is better to avoid getting or passing on gonorrhea in the first place,” Hughes said, “and everyone can significantly reduce their risk by using condoms consistently and correctly with all new and casual partners.”",30/03/2018
NewsDay,Tiffany Haddish reports an actress bit Beyoncé in the face,"The speculation is wide, rumors numerous and denials firm. And the crime? Somebody allegedly bit Beyoncé on the face at a party back in December.

How do we know this? Because Tiffany Haddish told us so, more specifically, GQ magazine in a profile released Monday. She didn’t nail the culprit but set off Beyoncé’s social media Beyhive of die-hard fans and a whole lot of internet sleuthing. The mystery even has a hashtag: #WhoBitBeyonce.

The latest nugget came Tuesday when TMZ reported multiple sources it did not identify by name as saying Haddish told them partygoer Sanaa Lathan is the culprit. She got the hive treatment — swarms of bee emojis — until she finally spoke on Twitter: “Y’all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyoncé and if I did it would’ve been a love bite.”

She of “The Best Man” movies included a single red-lip emoji to battle all those bees.

The purported bite (purportedly) occurred at an after-party for Beyoncé hubby Jay-Z’s “4:44” concert at The Forum in Los Angeles on Dec. 22. There was, purportedly, something about flirting with Jay, and something, purportedly, about the flirt being wasted.

“I can only think of one person who would do this. but I cannot say. but she....is the worst,” Chrissy Teigen speculated on Twitter, though she took a deeper dive of her own and later tweeted that particular unnamed “she” isn’t the culprit after all.

The Cut did some investigating, ruling out the likes of partygoers Queen Latifah and Rihanna. It narrowed its perp list to Lathan and Sara Foster, who played Jen Clark on “90210.” Foster’s comment: “Flattering that anyone thinks I could get this close to Beyoncé.”

Haddish told GQ she offered to kick the biter’s butt for Beyoncé but the queen said let it go.

NewsDay,Anti-Semitic slaying of woman in Paris: Suspects charged,"PARIS — Like many who survived Nazi horrors, Mireille Knoll embraced life, eating out and going to the theater despite limited means. Even as age and Parkinson’s disease took their toll, she delighted in receiving guests — until one of them allegedly stabbed the 85-year-old to death because she was Jewish.

The brutal killing in Paris last week has raised uncomfortable questions about resurgent anti-Semitism in France.

“I thought I was going to die on the spot. I cried all the tears in my body and I thought of her. She didn’t deserve this,” her anguished son, Daniel Knoll, told The Associated Press on Tuesday, near the Paris public housing project his mother called home for most of her life.

“How can one do that to anybody? The police revealed she was stabbed 11 times.”

Mireille Knoll was killed Friday in her apartment, which was then set on fire. On Tuesday, prosecutors filed preliminary charges against two people for murder with anti-Semitic motives, including a neighbor Knoll hosted regularly, to lessen her loneliness.

As Knoll’s family gathered in Paris to attend her funeral on Wednesday, horrified French leaders and activists called for people to take to the streets to protest racism.

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo urged all Parisians to join a silent march in memory of Knoll on Wednesday, and politicians across the political spectrum pledged to attend. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted his “absolute determination to fight against anti-Semitism.”

For Knoll’s family, the killing was a cruel coda to her long life.

At age 9, she fled Paris to escape a notorious World War II roundup of Paris Jews. French police herded some 13,000 people — including more than 4,000 children — into the Vel d’Hiv stadium in 1942 and shipped them to the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Fewer than 100 survived.

A family member with Brazilian citizenship helped Knoll and other relatives escape Nazi-occupied territory for southern Europe and then Canada. She returned to France only after the end of the war.

Over the years her grandchildren and other French Jews moved to Israel, but Knoll stayed in her beloved Paris, living nearly her whole life in the modest apartment on Avenue Philippe Auguste.

“There was nothing to steal. My mother was poor,” her son said. “Her credit card? She would have only been able to withdraw 100 euros. She had no money on her account.”

Authorities have not released the names of the two men in custody but have said the chief suspect is a 29-year-old with a past conviction who lived in the same building.

Daniel Knoll said the suspect had lived there since he was 7. His mother “took pleasure in having him at home and . . . although we’d asked her not to welcome him, she let him in like she always did, the same way she did with everybody, with kindness,” he said.

“My mother had a thirst for knowledge and meeting new people and talking to them and that’s what killed her,” he said.

On Tuesday, a photo of Knoll hung on her door, surrounded by paper hearts and a police notice saying the apartment was the subject of a judicial inquiry.

On a gate outside the building in eastern Paris, neighbors hung up a tribute poster. Candles flickered next to piles of flowers in her honor.

Smoke residue from the fire still stained her apartment window.

Knoll’s granddaughter, Jessica, lashed out at the attackers who “burned all of our memories, burned my entire childhood that I experienced there, in photos, albums, souvenirs.”

Speaking Tuesday in Herzliya in central Israel, Jessica Knoll stroked a ring her grandmother gave her on her last visit to Paris, and remembered her irrepressible energy.

“She used to run faster than us,” she told the AP.

Daniel Knoll remembered his mother as talkative and vivacious. In a home video she could be seen raising a glass and declaring, “Lechaim!” — “to life!” in Hebrew.

When she could still walk, he said, “she was going to restaurants, to theaters, to cinemas to see movies. She likes so much to read, she likes life so much. All those people who know war, they like life, maybe more than these crazy people” who killed her.

Mireille Knoll’s husband was deported to Nazi concentration camps, and their wartime experiences colored their children’s lives.

Yet despite a resurgence of anti-Semitic violence and vandalism in recent years, Daniel Knoll said he didn’t feel targeted for being Jewish.

Granddaughter Jessica, however, warned that “today it is my grandmother and tomorrow it will be a grandmother, a grandchild, someone else’s father.”

Jessica Knoll, who emigrated to Israel as a child 20 years ago, urged the French to “stop making excuses and see reality for what it is.”

The French Jewish group CRIF compared Knoll’s killing to that of Sarah Halimi, 65, who was beaten and thrown from her balcony last April. That murder was reclassified as anti-Semitic last month. The suspect is in a psychiatric hospital.

France’s government presented a plan earlier this month to fight racism and anti-Semitism, focusing on social media and prevention in schools. It also wants to change French law to force internet platforms to detect and remove illegal content.

An annual national count of racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-Christian acts — most involving threats — dipped in 2017 compared with the year before. But anti-Semitic violence increased by 26 percent, and criminal damage to Jewish places of worship and burial by 22 percent.",27/03/2018
NewsDay,Trump order would ban most transgender troops from serving,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under ""limited circumstances,"" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.

The White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria"" — those who may require substantial medical treatment — ""presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.""

Trump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.

""This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards — including those regarding the use of medical drugs — equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.

The new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, ""No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.""

The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing ""anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.""

""There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,"" said HRC President Chad Griffin.

Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy ""effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.""

Trump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.

Earlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.

The Justice Department said in a statement late Friday that it would defend the Pentagon's authority to ""implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation"" and would ask the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions.

The issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.

Under guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.",24/03/2018
NewsDay,Fight against opioid addiction starts with teens taking a stand,"The Bubonic Plague. The influenza pandemic. The HIV/AIDS epidemic. When I’ve learned in school about these diseases that affected millions of people, I’ve also learned about the incredible responses societies had: communities banded to educate their members about risks and provide resources and support in an effort to wipe out diseases that were killing people. Now we have another epidemic on our hands — the opioid epidemic.

The opioid epidemic is a crisis affecting millions of families across the country, and especially in my home state of Ohio. According to the Ohio Department of Health, there were 4,050 drug overdose deaths in 2016, a 33 percent increase from the prior year. With that number, Ohio claims the spot of states with the most opioid-related deaths.

I believe more can be and should be done to stop the deaths and help all the 20.5 million Americanswho had a substance use disorder in 2015. Of that 20 million, 2 million involved prescription pain relievers and 591,000 involved heroin.

I’d always known about the opioid epidemic, it was just a part of life. I can remember not being allowed to wear flip-flops in the alley during the summer because there were often discarded needles on the ground. There were certain streets I had to avoid because of the known drug activities that would take place there. Even when my friends lost loved ones to overdoses, it still didn’t seem real to me.

On the Fourth of July 2016, the opioid epidemic changed my life forever. My aunt was found dead from an overdose. She was only 40, a beautiful, funny, caring person who made everyone else around her feel loved. It finally hit me: If this could happen to my aunt, it could happen to anyone. Out of my sorrow grew determination and drive. I knew deep down I had the power to do something, to make a difference.

What I found most horrifying is that addiction can start in the most unsuspecting of places: the family medicine cabinet. Our whole lives we’re taught prescription drugs are meant to help us, to heal us, but the truth is they’re the most accessible drugs and potentially the most life-threatening. And in most homes, they just sit in an unlocked medicine cabinet.

Last year, I attended the 4-H Healthy Living Summit in Washington, a youth conference focused on providing hands-on learning and training for teens interested in addressing health-related issues. With my fellow 4-Hers, we decided to take action within our community. We could not just sit on the sidelines, we know that one addiction averted is one life saved. Together we developed an addiction education program that relies on teen leadership and decreases the stigma around addiction.

Our program is simple and grounded in reality. We put youths in Ohio in the same situation they’re in every day: staring at the medicine cabinet in their bathroom. We built a simulated bathroom, complete with a sink and vanity mirror. Inside the cabinet is what you would normally see in a typical family medicine cabinet: prescription pill bottles. The only difference is on the bottles are facts about addiction and opioids. The mirror brings young people face to face to realization that anyone — even themselves — can become addicted if prescription medications are mishandled.

We’ve traveled all around Ohio sharing our exhibit with youths at schools, fairs and more. Every conversation I had gave me hope we were helping to make a difference — person by person — but I knew it was not enough. That is why I’m working with 4-H to share the medicine cabinet project with young people all over this country in the hope they can take up the fight in their own communities.

Societies throughout history have risen to the challenge of ensuring deadly disease is thwarted. I am only trying to do the same. The only difference is the foe we’re facing. It’s not a viral infection or a bacterial disease, it’s a mental illness.

Young Americans across the country have the power to stand up and say: “Not my community.” I found support with my peers from my 4-H club, but the opportunity to make a difference can be found anywhere and with anyone. All it takes is the courage to take action.

NewsDay,Stony Brook grad student discovers gene in dangerous fungus,"The discovery by a Stony Brook University graduate student of a gene in a pathogenic fungus — a noteworthy feat for a scientist in training — is a potential boon for people with suppressed immune systems.

Mansa Munshi, a doctoral student in the molecular genetics and microbiology department, zeroed in on the gene in a fungal species known as Cryptococcus neoformans, a looming menace to organ transplant recipients and people infected with HIV. Her research includes a massive search for a compound capable of quelling the gene’s activity and ultimately serving as a human medication.

Beyond Cryptococcus neoformans, Munshi said the gene additionally is present in a significant number of other fungal species, including Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant superfungus that has alarmingly spread worldwide in less than a decade. It has been particularly prevalent in New York and New Jersey hospitals, with New York reporting the most cases nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

C. auris is defiantly resistant to many potent drugs that should be able to kill it. Any new gene-specific treatment that might emerge from the Stony Brook research may eventually aid the fight against the Candida strain as well.

“When I first began working on this project I pretty much started with a blank slate,” said Munshi, a graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. Maurizio Del Poeta, a Stony Brook physician/scientist. He has garnered an international reputation for his methods of selecting compounds to test as weapons in the war against pathogens.

Both scientists said they have found a few intriguing compounds that warrant further investigation because they may play a role in halting the gene’s activity.

Munshi and her Stony Brook collaborators recently reported the gene discovery and research on C. neoformans in the journal Cell Reports.

She has dubbed the gene, Cer1. It is a tiny snippet of DNA that carries the genetic blueprint for ceramide synthase, a fungus-specific enzyme that triggers the formation of lipid molecules that cells — whether human or fungal — use for a variety of self-sustaining purposes.

C. neoformans, the fungus that Munshi studies, uses lipids as building blocks in a vast array of complex molecules that not only enhance fungal survival in the environment but also in the bodies of people who become infected.

The fungus is harmless to healthy people, but a notorious cause of fungal pneumonia and fungal meningoencephalitis, a brain infection that can be fatal in organ transplant recipients, people infected with HIV, and others with a compromised immune system, Munshi said.

Infection occurs upon inhaling fungal spores, which are in the environment. Worse, current treatments are not always effective. Among immuno-compromised patients the troublesome issue with this organism is not drug resistance by the fungus but its persistence in people who have lost all shields against infection.

“In a lot of patients with lowered immunity, their bodies are not strong enough to control the infection. This pathogen can survive in the blood and spread to the brain,” Munshi said.

About 220,000 new cases of the infection are reported annually worldwide in patients with full-blown AIDS, the disorder that emerges in those with HIV who become vulnerable to a range of invasive fungi, bacteria and viruses.

C. neoformans and the broader family of cryptococcal fungi infections are so burdensome in developing countries that the World Health Organization created guidelines in 2011 stressing rigorous methods of diagnosis, prevention and patient management.

“We are trying to find a drug that can control the activity of this gene, something that will make C. neoformans totally debilitated so that it won’t be able to spread throughout the body,” Munshi said, noting that all fungi pose treatment difficulties — even toenail fungus, which can be persistent.

Fungi, which are yeasts, increasingly are characterized by problems of multi-drug resistance, an emerging health care crisis that affects hospitals globally.

In New Jersey, Dr. David S. Perlin, executive director and professor of the Public Health Research Institute at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said he welcomes new approaches to potentially deadly fungal infections, especially C. auris.

“New antifungals with novel mechanisms of action are desperately needed, especially as multidrug resistance to existing drugs is becoming more common,” he said.

Perlin said he hopes the Stony Brook team is on the right track.

“It may well be a viable approach and should be explored with C. auris and other Candida species,” Perlin said of blocking the activity of the Cer1 gene.

“The key is whether Cer1 or its equivalent in C. auris also plays a critical role in ceramide synthesis that cripples or kills the cell,” he said.

Perlin and colleagues are working on a new method to rapidly and accurately identify the deadly C. auris in swabs from patients and hospital surfaces.

C. auris was first identified in Japan in 2009 and has since spread around the world. Of the 215 cases reported in the United States through Jan. 31, the most recent date for complete statistics, 129 have been reported in New York and 52 in New Jersey. The superfungus can spread to patients through medical equipment, such as catheters and ventilator tubing. But there are other modes of transmission, Perlin said.

Most fungi are not passed person to person, but such is not the case when it comes to C. auris.

“Candida auris . . . persists on skin and on environmental surfaces, and it can be easily transmitted from person to person. This is highly unusual, which makes C. auris dangerous to high risk patients in hospitals, especially when strains become multidrug resistant,” Perlin said.

Del Poeta, meanwhile, noted that dozens of compounds are being screened to determine their capacity to block Cer1 gene activity.

A problem with some existing antifungals, Del Poeta said, is their high level of toxicity, something the Stony Brook scientists aim to avoid. He said the thrust of the research is to find a compound that is active against a very specific target.

“We are going after a single lipid pathway,” he said. “We have been using the same antifungals for the past 20 years. It’s time to come up with something new.”",10/03/2018
NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics reports narrower loss, growing sales","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. said Thursday its loss narrowed in the October-December period compared with a year earlier on higher demand for its rapid tests for HIV, syphilis and other diseases.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests reported a loss of $2 million for the final three months of the year, down from $2.6 million in the 2016 period. Performance in the year-ago quarter was impacted when a competitor outbid Chembio on a contract to supply HIV and syphilis tests.

Sales rose in the October-December quarter to $6 million, an increase of 41 percent year over year.

Chembio’s testing technology “is a cornerstone from which we can build and launch a meaningful pipeline of products,” CEO John Sperzel said.

He noted the company has received an $8.5 million order to provide testing components and tests to Brazil this year and a three-year, $15.8 million contract to supply Ethiopia.

Chembio also secured $2.9 million from drugmaker AstraZeneca for development of a test to detect an undisclosed biomarker.

Sperzel said the company recently raised $11 million by selling more of its stock to the public.

For the year ended Dec. 31, the company reported a loss of $6.4 million, compared with a loss of $13.3 million in 2016. Sales climbed to $24 million, a 34 percent gain year over year.

NewsDay,"Michael K. Williams talks ‘Hap and Leonard,’ ‘The Wire,’ more","He’s undoubtedly best known as Omar Little, the gay stickup man robbing drug dealers in the classic TV series “The Wire,” but Michael K. Williams has been a ubiquitous presence on TV and in movies for years now. From “Boardwalk Empire” to “The Night Of,” “Gone Baby Gone” to “The Road,” the 51-year old Brooklyn native has exhibited both charisma and the kind of acting chops that makes for great character actors. Lately he’s been delighting audiences in Sundance TV’s “Hap and Leonard,” playing Leonard Pine, a gay Vietnam vet with anger issues. The third season of the series debuts Wednesday, March 7 at 10 p.m.

Leonard is quite an offbeat character. What interested you about him initially?

I’ll be honest, the first thing was it was my first opportunity to lead a show. The second was the writing, I loved the world it lived in, and Leonard seemed like a walking contradiction, all these things that didn’t match. The fact he’s black, Republican, openly gay, his best friend is a hetero hippie white man. I’d never heard of a world like that.

You’re a guy from Brooklyn, and the series takes place in the South. Did you learn anything about the region from being in the show?

My father is from the South, and I have visited my family in South Carolina. What I had to be reminded of is how deep racism ran, how deeply embedded it was in the South, and how much people hated Hap and Leonard based on their relationship.

This year of the series seems especially timely, since it involves Hap and Leonard dealing with a group of white supremacists.

The writing is great. We always manage to be right on time with the climate. But you can’t plan for it, this season with the white supremacy, all the stuff going on in Charlottesville.

You seem to have an affinity for playing gay characters. Any particular reason why?

Subscribe to the Entertainment newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The gay community has always been a part of my life. My best friend who taught me how to be a man was a lesbian, a very outspoken lesbian. Another one of my friends died of HIV, and he grew up in the projects at a time when that was not welcome. I always look at the gay community like “so what?” Ironically the only time I wasn’t called softy was when I was in the gay community.

Obviously, playing Omar in “The Wire” was a real step up, career-wise. What attracted you to the part?

It was the writing, the cast. Omar was a walking contradiction. I know real Omars, gay dudes who will knock you out. I based him on dudes I grew up with in New York. I like the non-normal, that challenged me, made me go deeper as an actor, this openly gay black man who robs drug dealers with a straight face. Never heard of that before. It was the opportunity to do something different. I like characters society would normally walk by or throw away.

You have a very visible facial scar from a drunken bar fight you got into when you were 25. When you started acting, were you worried that that would inhibit your career?

I was called Scarface on account of the scar. And at the beginning of my career I used to play that, people thought I was a thug. But I got bored with that really quick. I knew I would have to get some chops to keep this going. It was then I found the Off-Broadway theater community in New York, that’s where I got my chops. Now it’s like “Michael, where did you get that scar?” “What scar?”

Did you have any movie idols growing up?

A lot of the movies that shaped my life, like “Saturday Night Fever,” I couldn’t get enough of John Travolta, then Prince in “Purple Rain.” Those characters shaped me, and molded me. I believe favorite movies are movies that moved you the most. What Travolta and Prince did, at the age I saw those, I was a kid, those years were my most impressionable, and those movies helped me define how I wanted to dress, walk. The swagger of a man.

What are you working on now?

I’m filming a remake of “Superfly,” set in Atlanta, and starring Trevor Jackson from “Black-ish” and Jason Mitchell from “Mudbound.” I play a character named Scatter, he’s like the mentor to the lead character.

Other than updating the setting, any significant differences between this version and the 1972 original?

In the original version there was a character you couldn’t see but you heard, and that was the soundtrack music by Curtis Mayfield. The difference between the first version and this is hip-hop, and there is no better city to set it in than Atlanta.",26/02/2018
NewsDay,Cat ownership causes tension between couple,"DEAR AMY: I’ve started to realize that I should probably rehome my cat. I adopted her four years ago when she was a kitten and she helped me to adjust to living on my own in a new city. My fiance is allergic and “not a cat person.” My cat is very rambunctious, gets into everything and likes to test authority. Having my fiance in the household for the past year has seemed to increase my cat’s anxiety and the tension has been the source of almost every fight. On top of that, my cat had a bumpy recovery after surgery and her anxiety since has been really difficult for me to manage. She gets upset if I even leave a room she is in. I am gone 12 hours a day. I totally fail to give her the attention and care that she needs. Several months ago my fiance told me that ultimately I would have to find a new home for her because it clearly wasn’t working for everyone. I didn’t want to admit to him that I had already seriously considered rehoming her. I know it’s petty, but I want to give conditions before I agree. My conditions are that he has to get rid of his saltwater fish. If we ever consider getting pets, I want the final say. The guilt of giving up this cat is crushing me. Even if I find a better home for her, saying goodbye to my cat will rip me into pieces. How do I navigate this?

Always a Cat Lady

DEAR CAT LADY: According to you, you have not provided this cat with the home she deserves to have. You are gone for 12 hours a day, and have not successfully dealt with the cat’s extreme anxiety. These unfortunate conditions are reason enough to find a different home for this cat.

If your fiance is allergic, I don’t see how you could place the blame so squarely on him for not wanting to live with a very high-maintenance, unhappy, dander-producing animal. His allergy is not his fault.

Do your fiance’s fish give you hives, get into everything or yowl whenever they are alone? If so, then the cat and the fish are somewhat equivalent. Otherwise, not so much.

Your fiance should be patient, understanding and kind toward you, and should help you to find a better home for your cat.

If your motivation to get rid of these fish is to force your fiance to give up his pets because you are giving up yours, then you might not be ready for marriage.

Marriage is about respectful compromise. Compromise doesn’t mean demanding that your partner must lose if you are losing.

DEAR AMY: You asked readers what they call a gift that the gift-giver likes but the recipient does not want, need or like. In my family this kind of gift is known as a “sidesaddle.” An example might be if a father gives his infant daughter a big-screen television, or a wife gives her husband a juicer that she wants. The story is that my great-grandmother once gave her husband a sidesaddle for Christmas. Of course, he could not use it, but she wanted it. And she got it!

DEAR READER: Your great-grandfather could have used the saddle, of course, but it might not have complemented his outfit.

I called this phenomenon an “Aunt Betty,” but I far prefer the “sidesaddle.”

DEAR AMY: You are answering lots of questions about DNA testing lately. DNA testing is becoming more accessible and popular, and it is creating problems because people can be contacted by DNA matches. Please point out that it is possible to “opt out” of this option, and to keep your DNA results private.

DNA Tested

DEAR TESTED: There are several different companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy. In one, users are offered an option to “opt out,” in another, opting out is the default setting, so users must choose to “opt in.”

Regardless of this, it is possible that DNA matches can find one another through social media if they are connected with a match who has not chosen a privacy option, leading to other family members.",18/02/2018
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics plans $11 million stock offering,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. hopes to raise about $11 million by selling more stock to the public to support expansion projects, including improvements to its Medford factory and headquarters.

The manufacturer of rapid tests used to diagnose HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika and other infectious diseases said Friday it intends to sell an additional 1.8 million shares.

Chembio had 12.3 million shares outstanding on Thursday when it announced plans for the stock sale but did not disclose details.

The shares for sale have been priced at $6.75. The sale will close “on or about February 13,” the company said.

On Thursday, Chembio shares closed down 30 cents, or nearly 4 percent, to $7.75 on the Nasdaq market.

The company said it would use proceeds from the stock sale for development of rapid tests, robots for the Medford factory, clinical trials, sales, marketing and other work.

Chembio lost $4.4 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared with a loss of $10.8 million in the same period of 2016. The 2016 loss included a $5.8 million charge for a deferred tax asset that the company can no longer use.

Revenue in the January-September period totaled $18 million, up 32 percent, year over year.

Customers pay up to $100 for 60-minute “float sessions” in which they lie on their back, floating in pitch-black darkness and silence, inside a clam-shaped pod, or womblike tank or room, filled with about 12 inches of body-temperature water and about 1,000 pounds of pharmaceutical-grade Epsom salt. Some commit to paying about that much a month for a membership that allows them to float routinely.

Some floaters, such as Mike DiLeo, 46, of Brookhaven, pay more than $400 a month to float twice a week.

“I’ve floated more than 100 times in the last year,” said DiLeo, who owns an ecommerce business. “Floating helps me focus.”

Floaters often seek stress relief, pain relief, or both. But many are seeking simply to relax.

Floating, which is also known as sensory deprivation therapy or restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST), was developed by Dr. John Lilly of the National Institute for Mental Health in Maryland in the 1950s.

It had its heyday two decades later but fell off suddenly in the ’80s. Many industry insiders attribute the decline to the AIDS epidemic and public wariness over contracting HIV from the water in float centers.

Movies like the 1980s fantasy-drama “Altered States,” in which the main character combines sensory deprivation experiments with hallucinogenic drugs and soon loses his grip on reality, didn’t help either, said Thomas H. Fine, an associate psychiatry professor at the University of Toledo, in Ohio, who conducted flotation therapy research early in his career.

“But now, floating is getting its second wave, and it seems as though the tide on this one is even stronger than the first,” Fine said.

“It’s hard to believe, but there was a time when massages, acupuncture or yoga were not as popular and widely acceptable as they are now. People are increasingly becoming more open to the idea of wellness and self-care.”

Nanda Viswanathan, marketing professor and assistant dean of Farmingdale State College’s School of Business, cited two reasons float centers are catching on here.

First, “technology and social media have made our lives much more connected but also much more hectic. It’s hard to find a place to get away from it all,” he said.

If businesses that offer floating can provide a space for people to decompress, they can get past the novelty factor and gain long-term sustainability, Viswanathan said.

“Stress is a genie that you can’t put back in the bottle,” he said. “It’s a great target audience. Everyone is stressed.”

Second, Long Island’s relatively older and wealthier demographic makes a good market for an activity that is somewhat expensive and can benefit “aches and pains,” he said.

Faith in floating

Five years ago Medford resident Thomas Wunk, 35, didn’t know what floating was.

He now co-owns The Float Place, a flotation-therapy business with locations in Deer Park and Patchogue.

Last year company revenues neared $500,000, said Wunk, who after floating only twice spent almost $3,000 on an old tank he found on Craigslist, gutted his basement, installed it and began running an at-home float center.

“My initial build-out costs were about $35,000. I maxed out all my credit cards,” he said.

“I just, after floating, felt so great. I went all in. I put all my faith in floating and that the business would just kind of work itself out because I passionately believed in it and its benefits.”

His business partner, Hardy Patel, 38, of Holbrook, was one of Wunk’s first patrons back in 2013. After a few floats, Patel also became a fervent advocate. He says floating alleviated symptoms of sluggishness and depression, and helped him make healthy dietary and lifestyle changes. Patel approached Wunk about opening the business in a retail space.

The Float Place’s Patchogue location, a 1,500-square-feet venue, features five private float rooms with names like “transcendence” and “serenity.” Patrons in the post-float room relax on a couch, drink green tea, jot down floating reflections in a notebook for others to read, and talk enthusiastically to each other about their experiences floating.

Dominick Ricciardi, 40, a photographer who has been a Float Place customer for about two years, said floating is a “de-stress hack,” a way for him to “creatively unblock.”

Mark Deturris, 34, of Shorham, learned about floating a couple of years ago through a podcast by “Fear Factor” TV host and stand-up comedian Joe Rogan. Deturris said floating allows him to “unload and let go” of some of the “overstimulation” of everyday life.

David Dreyfus, 49, of Carle Place, who said he has spinal herniations as a result of a 2015 car accident, and Susan Greening, 54, of Patchogue, who said a slip and fall injury tore a hamstring and inflamed a hip, laud floating as a portal to “pain relief” and “self-healing.”

Limited research

A 2006 study published in the International Journal of Stress Management said that floating provided relief of stress-related pain from anxiety, burnout, exhaustion, insomnia and whiplash injuries.

Roderick Borrie, a licensed psychologist with offices in Selden and Setauket, said obtaining medical recognition for floating is “an uphill battle.” Borrie and Toledo professor Fine wrote a review of research in the field titled “Flotation REST in Applied Psychophysiology,” published in 1998 in Biofeedback Magazine, an outlet of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback that said floating appeared to be effective in treating anxiety and stress-related pain.

Borrie since conducted a 2011 case study to determine whether floating is an efficient treatment for people diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a disorder of musculoskeletal pain with fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues.

Flotation centers in five countries offered free float sessions to people diagnosed with fibromyalgia; 80 subjects floated once a week for three weeks.

According to the study’s website, fibromyalgiaflotationproject.com, the results provided evidence that flotation REST can decrease fibromyalgia patients’ pain, muscle tension, anxiety and stress.

Float centers don’t need a license in New York State and aren’t regulated. Owners say the high salt content in the water helps to keep it sanitary. And they say they pay strict attention to cleanliness, filtering the water, exposing it to ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, and taking other sanitary measures. Clients must shower before floating.

For hippies and housewives

Kimberly Boone opened float business Hope Floats in her hometown, Bethesda, Maryland, in 2013.

In October 2016, after a friend told her to “check out Long Island” because the “business would do very well” in the area, she opened a second location, with two tanks, each a little larger than a twin-size bed, in Williston Park.

Boone, who said for many years she was a “typical soccer mom,” said floating in a sensory deprivation tank helped her deal with alcoholism-related anxiety and depression.

“Hope Floats grew out of my desire to help other people who were going through similar issues,” she said. Company revenues for 2017 were in the $350,000 to $400,000 range, she said.

Boone’s business also features an infrared sauna, which produces lower temperatures than a traditional sauna by using infrared light instead of a heater and stones to warm the air. Deals on the company’s website package a 60-minute float session with 30 minutes in the infrared sauna for $95.

Other businesses like Cryocure Cryotherapy and Flotation Center in Bellmore, Peconic River Salt of Joshua’s Place in Riverhead and Emerge Yoga and Wellness in Massapequa, offer memberships and package deals that bundle floating with other wellness industry services such as acupuncture, cryotherapy (treatments using freezing cold temperatures), a salt lounge, massages and yoga.

At Peconic River Salt, executive director Emily Harsch said about 10 people float in the center’s two pods daily. The company’s website says float sessions cost $85.

At Cryocure, owner Inga Fruman, who is a licensed acupuncturist, said floating alone brings in about $10,000 a month in sales.

Fruman cross-promotes services among clients and said despite advertising in local newspapers and on social media, word of mouth is the most efficient form of marketing for wellness businesses.

“Some people come for the cryotherapy and stay for the floating,” she said. “Or float and then go into the infrared sauna. They leave here relaxed and then tell their friends.”

Interest in floating is becoming more mainstream, researchers and owners say.

“It’s not just for hipsters by any means,” said Hope Float’s Boone. “It’s a concept that seems kind of out there, but after trying it people realize it’s not that out there, it’s for everyone. Hippies and housewives.”",02/02/2018
NewsDay,The holy grail of flu prevention,"Seasonal influenza — the flu — sickens and kills many Americans in a good year, and this is already a bad one.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since 2010, flu has annually caused “between 9.2 million and 35.6 million illnesses, between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths.” In the 2017-18 season, which began in November and won’t end until March, hospital emergency rooms are overflowing, deaths are running ahead of recent years and pharmacies are low on the anti-flu drug Tamiflu and intravenous solutions needed to keep patients hydrated.

Vaccination ought to be the key to prevention. According to estimates from the CDC, in six influenza seasons starting in 2005-06, vaccination prevented 13.59 million cases. That looks impressive, but our current vaccines are barely adequate, and the nation’s drug regulators and science-funding agencies aren’t doing enough about it.

Because flu viruses mutate frequently, vaccines are reformulated each year to target the virus strains predicted to prevail during the coming fall and winter. How well the flu shot works depends on how accurate the prediction is. Since the 2004-05 season, the flu vaccines’ effectiveness has varied from 10 percent to 60 percent.

This year, the vaccine is an especially poor match, in part because what’s going around is predominantly a virulent strain called H3N2. Although that strain is targeted by this season’s flu shot, most of the vaccine is prepared from fertilized chicken eggs, a method known to reduce its effectiveness against certain strains, particularly H3N2.

We can do better.

Vaccines work by exposing us to non-infectious components of a virus — the viral antigens — that elicit an immune response. Regulators could encourage manufacturers to stop using chicken eggs and instead prepare vaccines in “cultured cells” — cells that are removed from animals and grown in controlled conditions. This method would produce vaccines with greater fidelity to the targeted flu strains.

We also need more research on “adjuvants,” chemicals mixed with the viral antigens to further boost our immune response.

But most of all, we need to accelerate research on the holy grail of flu prevention: a “universal” vaccine that would target a part or parts of the virus that remain unchanged among different strains, even during the virus’s rapid mutations. A universal vaccine has the potential to provide us with permanent protection from all strains of flu.

Several different approaches to a universal vaccine are being pursued, and the preliminary research is promising. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly meager federal research funding in this area.

A recent New York Times article, by Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, and writer Mark Olshaker, tracked the government’s investment in flu vaccine research: “The National Institutes of Health has publicly declared developing a [universal] vaccine a priority, [but] it has only about $32 million this year specifically for such research.” Another federal agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, is spending $43 million on a single pro-ject in pursuit of “game-changing influenza vaccines.” These are minimal efforts when matched against the $1 billion spent annually on developing an HIV vaccine and the many billions that have been spent on vaccines for the Zika and Ebola viruses.

Within the vaccinated population, a vaccine’s effectiveness varies widely because it is affected by the general health and age of the recipient. Although people 65 and older make up only 15 percent of the U.S. population, on average, they account for about 60 percent of the hospitalizations and 90 percent of the deaths attributed to seasonal flu.

Seniors respond less well to vaccines than younger people because, as we age, our immune system functions less well. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health, after reviewing 31 vaccine response studies comparing groups of different ages, called for more potent formulations for the elderly. But exactly how strong the shot should be, and whether additional injections would boost immunity, requires more study. There is a flu vaccine for people over 65 that contains four times as much antigen as regular flu shots, and one that contains an adjuvant, but they have improved the shot’s effectiveness only slightly.

An increase in research funding on adjuvants, more effective dosing regimens and better production methods are simple changes that would better prepare us to face flu outbreaks. Increasing the funding for developing a universal vaccine is more challenging, but it promises much greater results. The fraught flu season of 2017-18 is a sign we need to conquer the disease once and for all.

NewsDay,Middle Island teachers bring help and hope to Kenyan orphans,"For many teachers, winter break usually means chilling out at home or maybe heading upstate for some skiing. Eight times over the past 11 years, Kevin Mann of Middle Island has taken a 16-hour flight to Kenya, followed by a rugged six-hour bus ride from Nairobi to Meru. With his wife, Aida, and many of his students in tow, he’s made the winter pilgrimage to Jerusha Mwiraria Hope Children’s Fund Home, an orphanage Kevin Mann founded with a fellow Long Island high school teacher, Lawrence Hohler.

“My wife and I have gotten much more from the orphans than we’ve given them and learned much more from them than they learned from us,” Kevin Mann said. “They have taught us wealth is not determined by things, and friendship doesn’t stop with age, ethnic groups or boundaries.”

The Manns have been inspired by many of the children who have lived in the home on a hill near Meru National Park. There is a blind child named Vincent who went to live there when he was 6, after his parents were murdered. Now 22, he was recently reunited with his extended family.

Their most lasting friendship has been with Risper Mwendwa, an orphan whose parents died of AIDS. The Manns, who have five children from previous marriages and six grandchildren, have come to think of Mwendwa, whom they met on their first trip to Kenya, as a daughter.

“We’ve had some wonderful times with her,” said Kevin Mann, now 65, who retired in 2014 after teaching history, English and social studies for 41 years at Shoreham-Wading River High School. They’ve taken Mwendwa, 22, whom they support with an annual $365 contribution they call a “mentorship,” on safari and on trips to Nairobi. “When she was in secondary school and she was a junior, we got to go to parents’ day,” Kevin Mann said.

Mwendwa recently completed an internship in government services at Uchumi House, a Nairobi government office, and is about to graduate with a diploma in human relations from a technical school in Nairobi. She wrote in an email that the Manns “have always been the best parents I would ask for. My primary education, high school education and my college, too, has been a success because of them.”

AN UNUSUAL ORPHANAGE

Situated inside a former church, with a dining hall and separate dormitory floors for boys and girls, the Meru orphanage has provided shelter and other basic needs for 100 children, many of whom lost their parents in the AIDS epidemic.

“The children in the orphanage have the highest standard of living in the community — they have a roof over their head, steady meals, and they don’t have to forage for wood,” Kevin Mann said.

Mann, who graduated in 1970 from Hicksville High School, has always been interested in other cultures. He earned a bachelor of arts in history, Asian studies and education, and a master’s degree in liberal studies, both from Stony Brook University. In 1974, he began teaching Asian and African studies at Shore-Wading River High School. In the 1980s, he volunteered with a United Nations campaign to free Nelson Mandela from life imprisonment in South Africa.

While working as a volunteer in Suffolk County with Habitat for Humanity in the early ’90s, Mann met Hohler, an Afro-Asian culture studies teacher from Port Jefferson who first visited Africa on sabbatical in the 1970s.

After Hohler, now 74, retired in 1999 from Smithtown East High School, he began raising money for the orphanage in 2000. He was inspired by a Kenyan named Joseph Kirima, a primary schoolteacher and headmaster, Kenyan teachers’ union leader and advocate for orphans, who came to Long Island to help him promote the project.

Hohler brought Kirima to meet Mann, whose interest in the orphanage was piqued. In 2001, Hohler registered the Hope Children’s Fund as a nonprofit tax-exempt charity and raised $40,000 through donations on Long Island and in Kenya. It was enough to begin construction on the orphanage.

When the orphanage opened in 2005, Hohler said, “We took 18 kids off the streets.” One of the boys accepted at the home had been begging for food at the door, he said. “Now they [the orphans] are 18, 19, 20 years old.” Hohler continued, “One is a pharmacist, another one sells beauty aids to beauty shops, one is going to be a doctor.”

Hohler said the children are encouraged to apply to secondary schools — which charge tuition — and get college degrees. “ ‘Education Is the Key’ is what we have printed on the wall at the dining room at the home,” he said. “Without an education and the ability to speak English, these kids would be assured that they wouldn’t rise above hewers of wood and drawers of water.”

CHARITABLE EFFORTS

The Manns have raised money for scholarships for the orphans by selling crafts made by the Meru Women’s Collective, an organization in Meru that makes and sells jewelry and other crafts at markets. The couple, along with their daughter, Tiffany, 33, of Shirley, serve on the 10-member board of the Hope Children’s Fund, which is holding a fundraising gala on Feb. 18 at East Wind Long Island in Wading River.

Last year, the Hope Children’s Fund provided scholarships to 35 students attending technical schools, including the prestigious Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi, Kevin Mann said.

Visiting the orphanage has been life-changing for many of the students and Shoreham-Wading River alumni who’ve taken the trip with the Manns.

“It’s a very emotional trip,” said Aida Mann, a retired bilingual cellphone sales representative. “When people go to the orphanage, there seems to be a magnetic bond between a child and a visitor.” She continued, “If we go with 20 kids, those 20 kids will hook up with 20 orphans, and they spend whatever time they are there holding their hand, playing with them, talking about music.”

“When we got there and the kids from the orphanage came pouring out, it was a little overwhelming,” Matt Millheiser, 35, of Center Moriches, a former student of Mann’s, said about his 2013 trip. “As you get to know them [the orphans] and see what kind of great young people they are, and then learn what they went through, they change the way you look at things. You look at all the things we have and take for granted, and the silly things we get frustrated about.”

a land of safaris

During two weeks in Kenya, Millheiser went on what has become a tradition — a safari in Meru National Park, the famous preserve where elephants, giraffes and other African wildlife roam free.

Another Shoreham-Wading River graduate, Julie Lindell, made the trip in 2011, 2012 and 2013, after taking Mann’s high school community relations course. Lindell paid for the first trip with $2,800 her parents had put aside for her Sweet Sixteen party. One of her most memorable experiences was meeting Vincent.

“I don’t know why or how, but Mr. Mann always said that when I stepped into the room, he [Vincent] would know I was there and would say, ‘Julie?’ ” Lindell, now 22, and student-teaching in Bloomington, Indiana, recalled. “He was probably one of the most intelligent and brave kids I’ve ever met.”

Mann requires that those accompanying him pay their own travel expenses and bring just two suitcases — one packed with clothes and another with donations, which will then be filled for the return trip with Meru-made crafts sold for fundraising on Long Island.

The donations have included 10 suitcases of Band-Aids, which are prohibitively expensive in Meru but important in preventing HIV transmission. Mann has shipped 60 laptops — reconditioned by students at Eastern Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Services’ Eastern Long Island Academy of Applied Technology — for a new technology center outside the orphanage.

Not every gift has had the desired effect. On their first trip in 2007, the Manns thought it would be a “kind gesture” to hand out milk and chewable vitamins to the children. “In Kenya, milk is given to people who are extremely sick or very old and not going to last long, and you only get medicine if you are terminally ill,” Mann recalled. The fearful looks subsided after Kevin explained the gesture to one of the older kids in the home.

At the end of each visit, the orphans have written letters for the visitors to read after they leave Meru. Transatlantic pen-pal connections have been difficult, however, because of Kenya’s unreliable postal system.

Thanks to a recent development, the visitors from afar will be able to communicate in the future with their new friends 7,000 miles away.

“Mail is tough, and if you leave it at the post office, they charge you for storage,” Kevin Mann said. The solution, says Mann: “It took us five years to do it, but now we have an email server.”",25/01/2018
NewsDay,Mathilde Krim dies at 91; was pioneering scientist against AIDS,"Whenever Dr. Mathilde Krim addressed scientific meetings and fundraisers, the room would become instantly silent — coughing and throat-clearing would stop, no one exited early.

Her soft but determined voice commanded attention. Her words were sprinkled with hints of the five languages she fluently spoke. With a doctorate in biology, Krim, an immunologist and geneticist, wrote reams of research papers on a class of minuscule proteins called the interleukins, key components in the immune response.

Years ago scientists, including Krim, thought that manipulating interleukins might produce a cure for cancer. It didn’t.

But while that failed to pan out, a new talent emerged in the 1980s when she was in her 50s — fighting the stigma that would soon confront people with AIDS.

Krim, a resident of Kings Point, died at her home last week at the age of 91.

She had blazed a long and memorable trail as a researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for 23 years and as co-founder in 1983 of amfAR, an AIDS research foundation, both in Manhattan.

“Dr. Krim was a cancer researcher who did pioneering work on interleukin,” said Kevin Robert Frost, amFAR’s chief executive.

She became a major figure in fighting the worldwide pandemic spawned by the human immunodeficiency virus, a role that began almost by happenstance at the very beginning of the outbreak, Frost said.

While at Sloan-Kettering, Krim unexpectedly saw a colleague one day who told her about a mounting number of young gay men who were sick with a mystifying condition.

“She was intrigued by these cases,” Frost continued. “She knew we were confronted with an infectious agent that could be spread person to person and she understood that we had never seen that agent before.”

Krim’s chance meeting led to a series of deep discussions. She and a growing number of colleagues knew it was time to brace for a novel pathogen. They were not alone, however, in that early recognition.

At the same time on the West Coast, doctors were seeing similar cases.

Dr. Michael Gottlieb, an immunologist in Los Angeles, would be the first to publish on the new disease in a scientific article that appeared in the June 5, 1981, edition of Morbidity and Mortality Report. The case studies centered on five Los Angeles patients.

Gottlieb’s observations were just the tip of the iceberg as cases began emerging exponentially nationwide. As the number of cases grew, affecting not only gay men, but people who relied on the blood supply, especially hemophiliacs in need of clotting factors, Krim began seeing the emerging disease not so much for its scientific puzzles as for the prejudice it produced.

“The thread that connects each chapter in her life wasn’t the science but the human rights causes,” Frost said.

Krim, who was born in Italy on July 9, 1926, grew up in Switzerland. She was a teenager when she learned about the Nazis and was horrified by the concentration camps they created.

By 1945 when the war ended, she joined the Zionist underground movement and helped smuggle guns to resistance fighters battling British authority in Palestine. Later, she became an “early supporter of Nelson Mandela and the fight against apartheid in South Africa,” Frost said.

There should be little surprise, he added, that she would take on the enormous human rights issues emerging in the AIDS pandemic.

Through amfAR, Krim raised millions of dollars for AIDS research. And among her dozens of honors is a Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President Bill Clinton.

Last summer, she told the online publication Infinite Fire that she would never abandon people with HIV.

“I’m an old lady now,” Krim told the website. “Sometimes I look out on my garden and think maybe I should stop and spend some time on the flowers. But I look and see the destruction AIDS has caused the young vital people . . . and I know I cannot stop.”

She was married to Arthur B. Krim, an entertainment lawyer and former head of Orion Pictures and United Artists, who died in 1994.

NewsDay,"Excerpt from Stefan Merrill Block’s new novel, ‘Oliver Loving’","Your name is Oliver Loving. Or not Oliver Loving at all, some will say. Just a fantasy, a tall tale. But perhaps those labels are fitting; maybe you were born to become nothing more than a myth. Why else would your granny have insisted your parents name you after your state’s legendary cattleman, to whom your family had only an imaginary genealogical linkage? Like yours, your namesake’s story was a rough and epic one. The original Oliver Loving, and his vast cattle empire, came to an end when the man was just fifty-four, shot by the Comanche people somewhere in the jagged terrain of New Mexico. “Bury me in Texas,” your namesake begged his trail partner, Charles Goodnight, whose name your granny later bestowed upon your brother. And so you might be forgiven for thinking that your future was foretold in the beginning. Just as the violence of your namesake’s time turned the first Oliver Loving into a folk hero, so did the violence of your own time turn you from a boy into a different sort of legend.

A boy and also a legend: you were seventeen years old when a .22 caliber bullet split you in two. In one world, the one over your hospital bed, you became the Martyr of Bliss, Texas. Locked in that bed, you lost your true dimensions, rose like vapor, a disembodied idea in the hazy blue sky over the Big Bend Country. You became the hopeful or desperate or consoling ghost who hovered over the vanishing populace of your gutted hometown, a story that people told to serve their own ends. Your name has appeared on the homemade signs pumped by angry picketers on the redbrick steps of your old schoolhouse, in many heated opinion pieces in the local newspapers, on a memorial billboard off Route 10. By your twentieth birthday, you had become a dimming hive of neurological data, a mute oracle, an obsession, a regret, a prayer, a vegetative patient in Bed Four at Crockett State Assisted Care Facility, the last hope your mother lived inside.

And yet, in another universe, the one beneath your skin, you remained the other Oliver, the one few people cared to know before, just a spindly kid, clumsy footed and abashed. A straight-A student, nervous with girls, speckled with acne, gifted with the nice bone structure you inherited: your father’s pronounced jaw, your mother’s high cheekbones. You were a boy who often employed the well-used adolescent escape pods from solitude, through the starships and time machines of science fiction. You were also a reverential son, eager to please, and you tried to be a good brother, even if you sometimes let yourself luxuriate in the fact that your mother clearly preferred you. In truth, you needed whatever victories you could win. You were just seventeen; after that night, only your family could remember that boy clearly. But yours was a family that remembered so often and well that it could seem — if only for a minute, here and there — as if the immense, time-bending gravity of their remembering could punch a hole in the ether that spread between you, as if your memories might become their own.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. said it will receive up to $2.9 million from AstraZeneca, the Cambridge, England-based seller of the acid reflux medicine Nexium and other drugs, for the new test.

The companies did not disclose the specific biomarker that the test will detect.

Chembio, with sales of $18 million in 2016, is best known for developing rapid blood tests used to diagnose HIV, syphilis, Ebola, Zika and other tropical diseases.

The company announced last month the successful completion of U.S. tests in humans of a new combination HIV and syphilis test. It plans to seek permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin selling the test and a companion results reader.

CEO John Sperzel said last month the research agreement with AstraZeneca will “leverage” Chembio’s testing technology “to develop and commercialize a novel point-of-care diagnostic test.”

AstraZeneca, a British and Swedish company, produces drugs to treat cancer, heart disease, stomach ailments, respiratory diseases and inflammation. It posted sales of $23 billion in 2016.",03/01/2018
NewsDay,Parents refuse to vaccinate a child. Are others at risk?,"DEAR AMY: My 2-year-old grandson’s parents refuse to have him immunized. This is causing a huge problem with the parents of our other grandchildren. Our 6-month-old granddaughter has not had all of her vaccinations yet, and her mother is worried about her being around the unimmunized 2-year-old. She is refusing to come to our home for the holidays if the unvaccinated child is there. We have several other grandchildren under the age of 10 whose parents also are concerned. Someone is going to miss this family gathering. How vulnerable is our youngest grandchild, who is still in the process of getting her first-year shots?

Frustrated and Concerned

DEAR FRUSTRATED: I turned to David Thoele, a pediatrician at Advocate Children’s Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois, for professional guidance.

Dr. Thoele responds: “Back in the ‘bad old days,’ when everyone saw polio, measles, diphtheria and other diseases causing severe illness and death, few questioned the value of vaccines.

“With the widespread success of vaccinations, these diseases have almost disappeared, thanks to individual immunity (people who are immunized) and ‘herd immunity.’ Herd immunity means most people are vaccinated, so everyone is protected: The disease is so rare it can’t spread. Herd immunity protects us all, but is especially important for people with weak immune systems, such as babies, people with cancer, HIV and cystic fibrosis.

“If enough people don’t vaccinate their children (vaccination rates have been decreasing), herd immunity will decrease, leading to outbreaks of these diseases. A recent outbreak of measles occurred in children who visited Disneyland — and most who caught the disease were unvaccinated or infants.

“The American Academy of Pediatrics notes that: Unimmunized children are at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and also create risk of disease outbreaks in young infants and children who medically cannot be immunized.”

I note the irony that this fortunate 2-year-old is likely protected from preventable disease by being surrounded by others who have been immunized. Because of this, understand that unless this toddler is in contact with people with active measles, polio or other diseases (highly unlikely), the chance the other children would catch one of these illnesses is exceedingly rare.

Dr. Thoele and I both hope that everyone attends the family get-together, and that all family members should try their best to be nice to one another. There is, fortunately, no vaccine preventing that.

DEAR AMY: I recently got married. I am 44, my husband is 50.

It is a second marriage for both. He told me his first wife was crazy and that she fabricated abuse allegations to the point where she has a lifetime restraining order against him. Twice he appealed the court’s decision and lost, so the order remains in place. I chose to believe him. Someone sent me some of the court documents outlining what his crazy ex-wife claims he did to her. It was full of physical, financial, verbal and sexual abuse. I wonder if I was wrong to believe him. What do you think?

Worried

DEAR WORRIED: My understanding is that a “lifetime” (or “permanent”) restraining order is issued through the courts, after both sides have presented evidence. The allegations would have to meet a standard of proof at this hearing. Your husband’s “crazy” ex would have had to convince the court that her allegations were true and that she was in continuing danger.

Your husband allegedly went to court twice to try to get this lifted, but was unable to convince the court that he was no longer a danger to his ex.

Understand that if the ex-wife is volatile, having a restraining order in place would also protect your husband from any contact with her. Without contact, she can’t continue to make allegations. Why appeal it?

You don’t mention who sent you these documents, but you should assume the person was trying to warn you, and yes, you should take this very seriously. You should go to the courthouse in the county where the alleged offenses happened (if you are able) to access these public records for yourself, or see a lawyer to try to verify them — and the claims they contain.

You also can contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at thehotline.org.

DEAR AMY: Your answer to “Worried Sister,” who was concerned about exposing her adolescent daughters to her violent, sex offender brother over the holidays was spot-on. That answer ranks as one of the best pieces of advice you have ever written.

Cynthia

DEAR CYNTHIA: Thank you. My advice was to trust her instincts.",22/12/2017
NewsDay,Seven very powerful words that scare the CDC,"The Washington Post published a story Saturday that revealed the Trump administration banned budget staff at The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using the following seven words: “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based” and “science-based.”

Although the CDC Director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald tweeted on Sunday that there are no banned words at the agency, it is important to discuss the meaning of these words. Why is it they are so powerful in maintaining and improving the nation’s health?

VULNERABLE. The World Health Organization defines vulnerability as “the degree to which a population, individual, or organization is unable to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impact of disasters.” This term may be referring to those facing economic disadvantages, racial/ethnic minorities, those living in poverty, or those with a chronic illness such as HIV. All of these groups disproportionately experience health impacts and thus need more assistance from public health professionals.

ENTITLEMENT. Entitlement programs are government-funded programs that provide a service or benefit to someone who meets eligibility requirements. Examples include Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. SNAP provides food stamps to individuals and families, and has proven to reduce the number of Americans living in extreme poverty.

DIVERSITY. President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, was intended to rally Americans behind improving the economy and creating jobs. What actually makes America great is our diversity. Between 2000 and 2010 the Hispanic population increased by 43 percent. By 2050, minorities will be the majority in the United States, including a doubling of persons over age 65. In public health, we value and embrace diversity, not ignore it, because it empowers us to be inclusive and makes us more receptive to different ideas.

TRANSGENDER. Transgender persons are those whose gender identity is not consistent with the biological sex assigned at birth. It is well documented in scientific literature that transgender people experience disproportionate rates of stigma and discrimination, lack of access to health care and prevention services, and experience higher rates of homicide, bullying, mental health illnesses, substance misuse and HIV. Public health professionals are striving to promote inclusive policies to reduce disease transmission and increase well-being and the quality of life for individuals of trans experience.

FETUS. The fetal stage of development is from conception to eight weeks. Noncontroversial, right? Wrong. The controversy lies in the following questions: Does a fetus have the status of a legal person? Does a fetus have a right to life? Is abortion a violation of a fetus’ right to life? Our nation’s prevention agenda aims to improve the health and well-being of women, infants, children and families. Women’s health should include a woman’s right to decide what is best for her and her unborn baby. Public health supports a woman’s legal right to a safe abortion.

EVIDENCE-BASED. In our graduate public health programs at Hofstra University, we teach students to use evidence-based decisions about which policies, strategies and interventions to plan, implement, and evaluate. This involves synthesizing research and evaluation findings to develop our scientific reasoning and inform decision-making. Let’s practice what we teach!

SCIENCE-BASED. To advance medicine, health care and public health we need to conduct rigorous research to see what works and what does not. This involves developing hypotheses, designing studies to test the hypotheses, observing results, and disseminating results so that others can learn from our successes and challenges. The Trump administration should allow public health scientists at the CDC to use their advanced training to fulfill the agency’s mission of saving lives and protecting people from health, safety and security threats.

It is dangerous when an administration’s ideology interferes to this degree with the ongoing work of science and public health. Let’s remember, it’s all about science, not silence!

NewsDay,"And for his next trick, Brian Cashman will . . .","Is there something else we can get Brian Cashman to do? Maybe smooth things over with North Korea or try his hand at tax reform?

Because the Yankees’ general manager is rolling right now, and with Saturday’s agreement to bring back CC Sabathia on a one-year, $10-million deal, Cashman’s mission to improve on last season’s remarkable run — while getting under the $197-million luxury-tax threshold — could not be going any better.

At this point, we’ll just assume a trade for Gerrit Cole is next. And would it surprise anyone if Cashman somehow navigated around the Orioles’ blockade to get another team to flip him Manny Machado, defying the anti-Bronx designs of owner Peter Angelos?

The Yankees again are reminding us that anything is possible when you’re singularly consumed with putting the best team possible on the field.

After falling one victory short of the World Series last October, Hal Steinbrenner could have taken a more conservative approach this offseason while pruning his payroll for 2018, a stated goal for years. With Aaron Judge becoming the biggest draw in the sport and the fan base smitten by the Baby Bombers, the Yankees really didn’t have to do much to capitalize on that momentum.

But Cashman, perhaps emboldened by a looming five-year, $25-million extension from Steinbrenner, took the opposite approach. He dismissed Joe Girardi after 10 years at the helm and reached into the ESPN booth for his replacement, Aaron Boone, as inexperienced a hire as there’s ever been in baseball.

With Cashman’s job security, he can afford a few dice rolls, and after losing out on Shohei Ohtani to the Angels — without even getting the chance for an interview — his old pal Derek Jeter came calling with the perfect pick-me-up in Giancarlo Stanton. The Yankees were stunned by Ohtani’s snub after spending years scouting him, but Stanton’s decision to waive his no-trade clause to come to the Bronx presented an opportunity Cashman was not going to let slip by.

Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The Yankees agreed to take on $265 million of the $295 million that Stanton has coming to him over 10 years, but they didn’t have to part with any of their top-tier prospects and still got to deduct Starlin Castro’s remaining $36 million. The crazy part is that Cashman really didn’t need Stanton. He just realized it would be bad business to not put him in pinstripes, so he did, swatting the dormant hive of Yankees-haters as an added bonus.

“My main goal is to field a championship-caliber team, which I do believe we have,” Steinbrenner said at Stanton’s introduction last week in Orlando. “I’m going to put every dollar I possibly can into making this club as good as it could be.”

And here’s the kicker: As much as Cashman is improving the Yankees, he’s also giving Steinbrenner what he wants on the back end — trimming enough payroll so his boss won’t have to pay the luxury tax for the first time in 15 years, as well as resetting the rate to allow him to spend big again for the free-agent apocalypse next offseason.

How is Cashman doing that? In addition to dumping Castro, he traded Chase Headley during the winter meetings for a savings of $13 million this season.

Cashman has confidently jabbed and weaved through this offseason, and that Headley space was quickly utilized to fit Sabathia, who probably could have commanded a more lucrative deal elsewhere after reviving his career at age 37. Like the Stanton situation, Cashman did have some leverage on his side. Sabathia’s family has been comfortably set up in the Jersey suburbs for the past decade and he has created a happy home for himself in the Bronx, where his accountability and clubhouse presence are nearly as appreciated as his pitching prowess.

That’s the hidden asset here. Sure, Sabathia went 14-5 with a 3.69 ERA during the regular season, then had a 2.37 ERA in four playoff starts. But with a rookie manager in Boone and the arrival of an imposing figure like Stanton — someone who’s new to the New York cauldron — Sabathia’s leadership will be more crucial than ever. Cashman certainly recognized that, and that has to be a relief to Boone.

“He’s somebody that I have so much respect for,” Boone said of Sabathia last week, “and is obviously so important to the Yankees’ franchise.”

Consider CC another box checked for the Yankees’ relentlessly efficient offseason, and Cashman likely isn’t done. Not with a stacked farm system and a prospect in Clint Frazier who is the perfect bait to obtain a young, controllable starting pitcher.

In what’s shaping up to be an impressive Yankees winter, it’s all coming up Cashman.",16/12/2017
NewsDay,LI trio wins $100G Siemens Competition team grand prize,"WASHINGTON - Three young scientists from the Half Hollow Hills school district won the $100,000 top award Tuesday in the prestigious 2017 Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology for their research into cell division that could help find treatments to cancers, viruses and other diseases.

Juniors Jillian Parker, of Half Hollow Hills High School West, and Arooba Ahmed and Jiachen Lee, both of Half Hollow Hills High School East, all 16, share the scholarship prize in taking the top spot in the team category. Twelve other national finalists were on five two- or three-person teams from across the country.

“I never would have thought this would happen, because all the other projects were amazing,” Lee said, adding that the victory gives her and her teammates confidence to continue their work.

Andrew Komo, 17, a senior at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, won the $100,000 individual grand prize for his work using cryptography to protect online auctions from cheating and fraud. Five others were finalists in the individual category.

Siemens Foundation CEO David Etzwiler, in remarks leading up to the award announcement, told all 21 finalists, “Whether or not you choose to pursue a career in science, you must now understand that you are in an elite club of people who are and will disproportionately change our globe for the better.”

The Long Island trio’s breakthrough research of the protein CCDC11 could help find treatments for cancer, Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s, among other diseases, scientists said.

“For the first time, they showed that this protein is involved in cell division. That’s a major finding,” said Ken-Ichi Takemaru, an associate professor in Stony Brook University’s pharmacological sciences department who mentored the teens. “Their work has broad implications in three different diseases: cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and also infectious diseases.”

The two top teams were called to the stage of Jack Morton Auditorium at The George Washington University in D.C. by Jeniffer Harper-Taylor, the Siemens Foundation’s head of STEM programs. When she announced the second-place team, the reality of the grand prize took hold for the Long Island students.

Parker let out a squeal and threw her hands over her mouth. Before long, the three were in a group hug in front of the auditorium of parents, teachers and others and soon were presented with a giant foam mock-up of a check for $100,000.

The three thanked each other and their parents, as well as Takemaru and Michael Lake, academic research director for the Half Hollow Hills high schools.

Ahmed said she hopes the award helps their research receive recognition and encourages people to study basic science.

In an interview before the announcement, the three said their 10-hour days in the laboratory at SBU last summer turned into a bonding experience as they got to know each other over microscopes and during late-night Skype sessions.

“We just really wanted to have a fun time,” Lee said.

The teenage finalists gathered in the auditorium Tuesday morning, many accompanied by their parents and science research mentors, after four days of presentations and networking. Balloons and posters of the research projects decorated the lobby and medals with teal-colored ribbons hung from the students’ necks.

The students were brought on stage in groups to talk about their experience in Washington. Parker and Ahmed said their other extracurricular activities helped give them poise in presenting to judges. Parker is a dancer and Ahmed is on the debate team.

Both Lee and Parker had advice for other scientist wannabes.

“Never hold yourself back. You never know what you can accomplish,” said Lee. “It’s really great to surround yourself with people who are passionate about research.”

Parker advised: “When you think you’ve worked hard enough, keep going.”

Competition judge Dr. John Woolford, a professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, said of their work: “This could alert us to the fact that people who present with one disease or problem might have other seemingly unrelated problems. This could help us understand how different diseases stem from the same genetic mutation.”

Erika Lee, Jiachen’s mother, said the trio’s research is “a new way of thinking about curing disease.”

The road to the Siemens championship involved weeks of painstaking work in the lab and on submitting the entry. Pervez Ahmed, Arooba’s father, said he canceled the family vacation to Disney World so his daughter could do the research.

“We didn’t have to tell the girls to focus, to work. It was all self-motivated,” said Mark Parker, Jillian’s father.

Ahmed, Lee and Parker were among 11 Long Island students named regional finalists on Oct. 18. They presented their work virtually to judges at Carnegie Mellon and were chosen as national finalists on Nov. 20.

Once in Washington, they spent a couple of days getting to know the other 18 finalists before giving a 12-minute presentation to judges on Monday.

All three teenagers said they want to pursue science.

“She found what she loved and that makes me really happy,” said Adrianne Parker, Jillian’s mother. “It was a full-time job. For a 16-year-old to get up at 6:30 a.m. on summer vacation . . . She wanted to do it.”

Second place was awarded a $50,000 prize. The remaining projects won $25,000 each. A total of more than 1,800 projects were submitted to this year’s competition.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics gets $13 million in orders from Brazil,"A Medford-based manufacturer of rapid diagnostic tests has secured nearly $13 million in orders from Brazil, executives said Tuesday.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. expects to ship $8.5 million in tests and test components next year for use by Brazil’s public health system.

The point-of-care tests will be used to combat HIV and Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease spread by sandflies. The symptoms of Leishmaniasis include skin ulcers, fever, low red blood cell count and an enlarged liver.

The order for tests and test components from Chembio comes on the heels of the company receiving payments of $4.2 million from Brazil for this year’s shipments.

The orders are substantial for the local company, which reported revenue of $18 million last year.

They come from Bio-Manguinhos, a subsidiary of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which is responsible for the development and production of vaccines, diagnostics and drugs for Brazil’s Ministry of Health. Chembio has worked with Bio-Manguinhos for several years.

Chembio CEO John Sperzel said the company’s “point-of-care diagnostic tests, along with prevention and treatment, are essential elements of Brazil’s response to HIV and Leishmaniasis incidence, and we are pleased to play an important role in the country’s effort to reduce infection rates.”

Chembio shares closed down 20 cents, or almost 3 percent, to $7.05 on the Nasdaq market. The stock is up 4 percent over the past 12 months.",05/12/2017
NewsDay,What Trump should do if he actually wants to cut drug prices,"President Donald Trump nominated Alex Azar to serve the next secretary of health and human services last week, tweeting that he would be “a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!”

In fact, Trump has made many grand claims that he will bring drug prices “way down.” But if the president is serious about drug pricing, Azar’s record isn’t promising. During his tenure as head of the U.S. division of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., Azar tripled the price of that company’s insulin, and he has played down the problem of high drug prices, arguing that they do not drive health-care costs.

The selection of Azar is important because the president already has significant power to tackle drug prices without the help of Congress. But he needs help from the HHS secretary.

So what could an administration serious about lowering drug costs do? For one, it could allow importation of more affordable drugs from Canada. Congress authorized pharmacists and wholesalers to do this in 2003, subject to the approval of HHS. But as a drug company executive, Azar went on record rejecting this approach. He said - as the industry long has - that the quality of these drugs cannot be guaranteed. But history shows that safety concerns can be properly managed, since the Food and Drug Administration previously has imported drugs to respond to critical shortages, and more than 40 percent of finished U.S. drugs - brand name and generic - are already manufactured overseas. The FDA could help develop similar safeguards for this purpose while guiding foreign manufacturers through U.S. inspections and approval, ultimately expanding even beyond Canada.

Once sensibly implemented by the FDA, importation provides an important way to combat unjustified price hikes for older, off-patent drugs. Turing Pharmaceuticals, for example, made news a few years ago when it acquired the U.S. rights to Daraprim, a drug long used to treat an infection that can affect those living with HIV/AIDS, and raised the price from $13.50 to $750 per dose. But the drug was being sold for $1 to $2per tablet in other countries.

Second, Congress provided a pathway to ensure drugs developed directly from federal government funds are fairly priced in the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. The federal government funds a great deal of research, and some of our most important new medicines come from that funding. One review found that public-sector research institutions directly contributed to the intellectual property covering more than 150 drugs and vaccines over the past four decades. If the Trump administration were serious about addressing the drug-pricing problem, HHS could require fair pricing of products developed with federal funds, and define circumstances when the government will intervene - such as if the drug is priced far beyond the average price in a set of comparable countries around the world. This would ensure that taxpayers get reasonable prices in exchange for their investment in a drug’s development.

Finally, Trump and Azar could bring the pharmaceutical industry to the negotiating table for excessively priced essential drugs covered by government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid. Current law allows federal programs to seek competitive bids for patented medicines, even if they come from companies other than the patent holder. In return, the government awards reasonable compensation to the brand-name manufacturer. If the government and company cannot agree on the compensation level, a court will set the amount - which may be quite lucrative but will likely be less than the price set by manufacturers in the inefficient U.S. market.

The government already used this law to obtain cheaper generic antibiotics for the military in the 1960s. In 2001, when anthrax attacks led the government to seek a stockpile of ciprofloxacin, George W. Bush’s administration threatened to use the provision, and reportedly achieved a 50 percent discount as a concession (Azar was serving as HHS’s general counsel at the time). HHS could explore the use of this option for federal programs and to work with states that want to invoke this strategy to expand drug coverage to local residents in need.

There are many other strategies that could be employed to help control rising drug prices, but these three are immediately available to a presidential administration serious about helping the vast majority of Americans who want something serious done about drug prices. Azar’s nomination is another ominous sign that these approaches will continue to be ignored in favor of useless tweets.

NewsDay,"‘Beyond a Year in Space’ review: Brisk, informative look at astronaut Scott Kelly","THE DOCUMENTARY “Beyond a Year in Space” WHEN | WHERE Wednesday at 9 p.m. on WNET/13

WHAT IT’S ABOUT Beginning March 27, 2015, astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko began a near-yearlong stay on the International Space Station, returning to Earth on March 1 of last year. Part of NASA’s mission: to study the long-term effects of living in space, in preparation for flights to Mars. Kelly, since retired, continues to play a vital role in the planned Mars trip because the space agency is studying both Kelly and his twin brother, Mark, to see what changes he underwent during those 11 months in space. “Beyond” explores a few of those.

MY SAY 2015’s acclaimed “A Year in Space” was a 12-part series produced by Time, condensed the following year into a PBS special, which will also repeat Wednesday (at 8 p.m.). But anyone who wants the full “Year in Space” treatment may want to start with those (all are online). Beautifully done, nearly hypnotic, they’re a you-are-there-with-Kelly series that immerse you into his world, both on the ground and aloft. By contrast — a sharp one — “Beyond” is the epilogue. It’s an efficient one packed with lots of information, but almost needs an epilogue of its own: What has exactly science learned about Kelly, and what are the long-term ramifications for that future flight to Mars? “Beyond” hedges its bets on this question. There’s still much to learn, and the process could take years — including if, heaven forbid, he were to develop cancer as a result of DNA mutation. Even then (one assumes) other non-space-related causes would have to be ruled out.

The process is enormously complex and the outcome could be years away, perhaps delaying the mission to Mars in the process. “Beyond” doesn’t spell this out, but you may find yourself wishing it does. Another hour would help, but in the meantime, this one suffices, and there is much new here.

Back on land, Kelly explains that “gravity really gives you a beatdown.” He says he had flu-like symptoms, even becoming “confused, delirious, achy.” For a week, his skin was inflamed with hives wherever it touched anything. NASA scientists say that one of the chief concerns of extended space travel is genetic mutation because of radiation bombardment in space. Both Kellys have identical genomes, so they can theoretically chart those changes, and perhaps learn how to re-engineer astronaut DNA to prevent any damage during a yearlong trip to Mars.

“Beyond” also introduces viewers to some of those astronauts who may one day be the first to step on Mars, including former Navy pilot Victor Glover and Jessica Meir. These two could be world-famous someday, and will have the Kellys to thank.

BOTTOM LINE Brisk informative overview of Kelly’s life back on the ground, but leaves a few questions unanswered, including this one: How long before that first trip to Mars?",14/11/2017
NewsDay,Cuomo signs legislation aiding veterans with PTSD,"Members of the U.S. military suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder will now be able to acquire medical marijuana to treat their condition as part of a series of bills signed Saturday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in honor of Veterans Day.

The legislation would allow members of the Armed Forces, police officers, firefighters and victims of rape, domestic violence and other violent crimes to access the state’s new medical marijuana program.

Cuomo’s office estimates that up to 19,000 New Yorkers could benefit from the change.

“Our veterans risked their lives in order to defend the ideals and principles that this nation was founded upon, and it is our duty to do everything we can to support them when they return home,” Cuomo said in a statement.

Medical pot is currently legal in New York to treat a dozen ailments, including cancer, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, HIV, AIDS and Lou Gehrig’s disease.

PTSD often involves a patient suffering from flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia and numbing after experiencing a traumatic stress event. Virtually every state in the nation with a medical marijuana program allows for the treatment of PTSD.

Cuomo signed four additional bills Saturday increasing services for veterans or honoring members of the Armed Forces.

One bill, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Croci (R-Sayville), provides combat veterans working for the state with eight additional days of paid time off to obtain medical services, counseling and access to other benefits.

Currently, public employees with military experience are provided paid leave to perform any type of military duty, totaling 30 calendar days or 22 working days.

Additional legislation signed by Cuomo would waive the Civil Service examination fee for veterans who were honorably discharged; require the state to maintain a public list of all not-for-profit groups that solicit funds for the military and set aside a chair in the State Capitol for POWs who are considered missing in action since World War I.",11/11/2017
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics reports narrower loss as sales jump,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Wednesday said its loss narrowed in the July-September period compared with a year earlier on increased sales of its rapid tests for HIV and other diseases.

The Medford-based manufacturer of diagnostic tests said it lost $600,000 in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $2.1 million in the same quarter in 2016.

Sales rose 102.5 percent in the three-month period to $7.6 million, year over year.

CEO John J. Sperzel said, “during the third quarter of 2017, the company continued to make progress with each of its key objectives: strengthening the core sexually transmitted disease business, building a broad tropical and fever disease portfolio, and building a global commercial team.”

He returned to his job last month after receiving a heart transplant. Sharon Klugewicz, the company’s president of operations in North and South America, served as acting CEO from July through September.

Sperzel also said Wednesday that Chembio has completed development of a malaria test and hopes to begin selling it next year.

NewsDay,The forgotten front in the battle against the opioid epidemic,"Multiple leaders across the nation, including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and even President Donald Trump, have declared states of emergency in response to the opioid epidemic. Policymakers claim to be battling this public health crisis on all fronts, but one arena continues to be conspicuously ignored: our prisons and jails.

Roughly half of all incarcerated individuals suffer from addiction. And in the two weeks following their release, former prisoners are 129 times more likely to die from overdose than members of the general population.

This is despite the fact that we have robust evidence showing that we can decrease the incidence of relapse, overdose, drug-related health complications like HIV transmission, criminal activity after release and recidivism by offering treatment. And unequivocal data highlights that medication-assisted therapy - that is, treatment with methadone or suboxone - in prisons saves lives.

A study published recently in the journal Addiction showed that offering medication-assisted treatment in prisons reduced drug-related overdose deaths by 85 percent in the four-week period following prisoner release and reduced mortality from all causes by 75 percent over the same period. Few other medical interventions have demonstrated such success.

Unfortunately, however, the majority of correctional facilities in the United States do not offer programs for people addicted to opioids. Out of the 3,200 U.S. jails, only 23 provide maintenance therapy to inmates. And out of the 50 state prison systems, only four offer such treatment. This means that people who are fortunate enough to be part of a treatment program before their incarceration are, upon their entrance to a jail or prison, often taken off their medications and forced to endure cruel, painful and dangerous periods of withdrawal.

This is not a problem of resources. Many incarcerated patients currently receive appropriate care for other chronic conditions, including diabetes, HIV, cancer and even more-newly-recognized disorders, like gender dysphoria. Our federal and state corrections systems have the capacity to offer this treatment - a treatment defined as “essential medicine” by the World Health Organization. Anne Arundel’s Road to Recovery program and other correctional facility programs (Riker’s jail in New York, the prison system of Rhode Island and Vermont) demonstrate that success with medication-assisted therapy is possible.

The inability to access medical treatment with such established benefits is an unacceptable violation of prisoners’ constitutional right to basic health care. But this is not just an issue of rights, and this is not just about prisoners. This is a critical public health issue, and the benefits of the therapies we can offer to people with opioid addiction who are currently incarcerated reach far beyond those individuals. Our communities benefit too when we help those suffering from addiction get the care they need to survive and live healthy lives.

Skeptics will argue against such treatment by asserting that it is too expensive, or that it will be “diverted” and used inappropriately, or that the people with addictions who end up incarcerated should have taken more personal responsibility. But these interventions have been shown to be cost-effective. Diversion can be minimized, while treatment could actually improve security. And moralizing arguments against a well-recognized psychiatric disorder are antiquated, demonstrating poor knowledge of evidence-based treatment, if not also little compassion for a vulnerable population.

As a primary care physician who has worked with formerly incarcerated patients, I have seen first-hand that suboxone allows many people to concentrate on their lives instead of their addictions upon their release from jail or prison. And if we want to save lives on the streets, we cannot send people out of prisons untreated and abandon them when they are the most vulnerable to overdose. If we’re serious about addressing the opioid epidemic, we have to pay attention to the evidence demonstrating that opioid treatment in jails and prisons is highly effective, and we must act by quickly expanding such treatment to many more facilities around the country.

Current programs offering in-facility treatment should guide the nation, serving as examples of how we can provide vulnerable, disenfranchised people with the care they deserve as fellow humans and members of our society. If we claim, whether as a community, a state or a nation, to be fighting the opioid crisis on all fronts, let us not forget one that offers undeniable evidence of a way to save lives.",03/11/2017
NewsDay,Court bars Trump from reversing transgender troops policy,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday barred President Donald Trump’s administration from proceeding with plans to exclude transgender people from military service.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the transgender service members who had sued over Trump’s policy were likely to win their lawsuit. She directed a return to the situation that existed before Trump announced his new policy this summer, saying the administration had provided no solid evidence for why a ban should be implemented.

Trump had ordered a reinstatement of the longstanding policy that barred transgender individuals from joining the military; service members who were revealed to be transgender were subject to discharge. Under President Barack Obama, that policy was changed last year to allow transgender people to serve openly.

The Trump administration may appeal Kollar-Kotelly’s decision, but for now, the proposed ban remains unenforceable under Kollar-Kotelly’s preliminary injunction.

“We disagree with the court’s ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps,” said Justice Department spokesman Lauren Ehrsam.

She reiterated the department’s view that the lawsuit was premature because the Pentagon was still in the process of reviewing how the transgender policy might evolve.

One of the attorneys handling the lawsuit, Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the ruling was an enormous relief to his clients.

“Their lives have been devastated since Trump first tweeted he was reinstating the ban,” Minter said. “They are now able to serve on equal terms with everyone else.”

Trump announced on Twitter in July that the government “will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” He followed with an August memo directing the Pentagon to extend indefinitely a ban on transgender individuals joining the military, and gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis six months to come up with a policy on “how to address” those who are currently serving.

Under the Obama administration, the Department of Defense had announced in 2016 that service members could not be discharged solely based on their gender identity. Transgender individuals were to be allowed to enlist in the military in June 2017, a timeline initially delayed under the Trump administration to Jan. 1, 2018.

Minter said the new court ruling means they will be able to enlist as of that date.

The Trump administration had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit; Kollar-Kotelly refused to do so, and Minter said it’s possible the case will go to trial.

One issue not directly addressed in Monday’s ruling was whether federal funds should be used to pay for sexual reassignment surgeries for members of the military. The administration has sought to prohibit such payments; Kollar-Kotelly said she didn’t have jurisdiction to rule on the issue because none of the plaintiffs in the case established a likelihood of being impacted by that prohibition.

The lawsuit was filed in August by the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) on behalf of eight transgender individuals, including service members in the Air Force, Coast Guard and the Army, as well as students at the U.S. Naval Academy and in the ROTC program at the University of New Haven.

The Justice Department, in seeking the lawsuit’s dismissal, said none of the plaintiffs had established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.

The two advocacy groups who filed the lawsuit assailed that assertion. They highlighted the uncertainty facing Regan Kibby, the transgender Naval Academy student who — because of Trump’s action — was unsure whether he would be able to join the Navy on graduation.

Kollar-Kotelly said the plaintiffs clearly established that they would be harmed by the administration’s directives. She also contended that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in arguing that the directives were unconstitutionally discriminatory — targeting transgender people without evidence that their service caused substantive problems for the military.

The directives “do not appear to be supported by any facts,” the judge wrote.

Other lawsuits challenging president’s directive have been filed in Seattle and Baltimore.

Oral arguments are scheduled Nov. 9 for the Baltimore lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of six transgender service members.

“The federal courts are recognizing what everyone already knows to be true: President Trump’s impulsive decision to ban on transgender people from serving in the military service was blatantly unconstitutional,” said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project.

The Pentagon has not released data on the number of transgender people currently serving, but a Rand Corp. study has estimated between 1,320 and 6,630, out of 1.3 million active-duty troops.",30/10/2017
NewsDay,LI manufacturers retrench in face of minimum wage hike,"New York State’s new, higher minimum wage is leading to drastic actions by factories on Long Island that produce food or drugs, have small staffs or use low-skilled workers on their assembly lines, according to executives and government records.

Framerica, a picture-frame manufacturer in Yaphank, canceled $3 million in building plans and equipment purchases. Uncle Wally’s, a Shirley-based muffin maker, won $1 million in tax breaks after threatening to lay off one quarter of its workforce. And Chembio Diagnostics, a medical device company with operations in Medford and Holbrook, will shift some production to a plant in Malaysia because of the rising minimum wage.

“We’re looking more and more toward automation and moving some of the work to the lower-cost facility” in Southeast Asia, said Sharon Klugewicz, president of Chembio’s Americas division.

The impact on manufacturers of increasing the state’s minimum wage wasn’t discussed much in the state Capitol last year when the legislature agreed to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s ambitious proposal to hike the hourly rate from $9 to $15 over the next few years. The debate mainly focused on farms, retailers and other service businesses where a majority of employees earn the minimum wage.

Proponents of a wage hike said that raising pay would boost the economy because workers would spend more locally. Opponents said increasing the minimum wage would cost jobs.

Cuomo overcame opposition to the measure by including the wage raise in the 2016-2017 state budget, which had to be adopted in order to fund state operations.

In Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties the minimum rose from $9 to $10 per hour on Dec. 31, 2016, and it will rise by another $1 each year until $15 is reached in December 2021.

Manufacturing is usually thought of as a high-wage economic sector. But many factory jobs pay close enough to the minimum wage to be affected by any increase.

In New York State 34 percent of plant workers, or about 207,900, make less than $15 per hour, according to an analysis by the research firm Moody’s Analytics of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2014. Similar figures for Long Island weren’t available.

More than six in 10 manufacturers surveyed across the state in March by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the higher minimum wage had affected them.

“The potential for lost jobs is particularly acute, given that manufacturers face global competition,” said Moody’s economist Adam Ozimek. “If wages become too high in one place, it’s easier for a manufacturer than for, say, a restaurant to relocate operations.”

The Island has about 2,900 plants, according to the Workforce Development Institute, a statewide not-for-profit based in Albany. Together, their combined payrolls averaged 86,800 workers between 2011 and 2015, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Executives of Framerica Corp., the producer of high-end picture frames, were alarmed by the prospect of a $15 minimum wage, according to economic development officials and government records.

Framerica asked for additional tax breaks from the Brookhaven Town Industrial Development Agency weeks after Cuomo signed the wage hike into law in April 2016, IDA documents show. Company executives didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

“The new mandated minimum wage increase will no longer allow us to remain competitive,” Framerica senior vice president Dave Rosner wrote in a letter to the IDA obtained by Newsday under the state’s Freedom of Information law. “We are already at a substantial disadvantage compared to our competition who manufacture in business-friendly states such as North Carolina and Indiana or import from countries such as China.”

He estimated the higher minimum wage will add $3.5 million to Framerica’s costs through 2022. It had 184 workers last year.

Rosner also said the family-owned business had scrapped a $2.3 million installation of solar panels designed to reduce electricity bills, and more than $500,000 in equipment purchases because of the higher minimum wage.

The Brookhaven IDA extended Framerica’s existing package of tax incentives for 10 years. The company will save an additional $1.2 million, according to IDA estimates.

The IDA, at the same July 2016 meeting, also granted a 10-year extension of tax breaks for the Uncle Wally’s muffin company. The extension will save the company $1.1 million, according to IDA estimates.

Uncle Wally’s executives Michael Petrucelli and Louis Avignone, in an IDA letter obtained by Newsday, said, “For us to remain profitable, 1 out of every 4 of our workers will lose their jobs.” The company employed 160 last year.

The executives projected the wage hike will add $7.2 million in costs through 2022. They sold Uncle Wally’s earlier this year and recently referred a reporter to the new owner and parent company, Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp. of Toronto, which declined to comment.

Supporters of the $15 minimum wage, including Cuomo, dismissed the concerns of manufacturers such as Framerica and Uncle Wally’s.

“To the extent that you hear horror stories . . . I think those are anecdotal,” the governor told Newsday recently. “They are trying to exploit the situation to get government aid . . . Whatever story they can come up with to get government aid they will come up with.”

He also said raising the wage rate “had tremendous support from the business community across the board” last year. “We’ve heard nothing but positives since,” he said.

In terms of Framerica and Uncle Wally’s, Brookhaven IDA officials don’t believe the companies are bluffing.

“They are not just pounding their chest and blowing smoke,” said IDA executive director Lisa M.G. Mulligan, referring to Framerica. “They had been down [in other states] looking at buildings. They had made inquiries about how much it would cost to keep the operation going up here while they started an operation down there,” she said.

Other companies receiving help from the Brookhaven IDA have talked about canceling expansion projects or leaving Long Island since the state increased the minimum wage, though so far only Framerica and Uncle Wally’s have sought more tax breaks.

Not all local manufacturing executives feel burdened by the higher minimum wage. Some are even enthusiastic supporters.

“If you pay employees fairly, you will have less employee turnover, and that reduces your training costs,” said Jon Cooper, president of Spectronics Corp., a Westbury-based producer of ultraviolet lighting and fluorescent dyes used to detect fluid leaks in engines, machinery and cooling systems.

“You also will be helping the local economy, because if employees have more money in their pocket, they will spend it at local businesses,” he said.

All but a handful of Spectronics’ 180 employees earn more than the minimum wage.

Cooper, a former Democratic leader of the Suffolk County Legislature, spoke in favor of raising the federal minimum wage at a Capitol Hill news conference with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2014.

Still, local executives’ frustration and, in some cases, anger at the higher minimum wage was evident in March at a two-hour meeting with state Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon at Farmingdale State College, attendees said. About 80 people participated in the private session organized by the Manufacturing Consortium of Long Island.

Local factories face increased competition from most states and New York’s other regions because of how Cuomo and the legislature chose to implement the $15 minimum wage.

Only Arizona, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state and Washington, D.C., match or exceed Long Island’s hourly minimum of $10 this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Employers must comply with state laws if they require a higher pay rate than the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour.

In New York, the $15 wage hike is being implemented faster in New York City and slower in upstate regions than in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties.

“Why would I give business to a machine shop on Long Island when I could save money by going to Syracuse?” said Jamie Moore, the consortium’s president and co-founder.

He also said the types of manufacturers most affected by the higher hourly minimum have small workforces and rely less on technology than others, based on feedback from the consortium’s 54 members, who together have 4,000 employees. Pharmaceuticals and food production, among the fast-growing industries within manufacturing, have been hit hard.

Some factory officials said they are counting on yearly state reviews of the wage increase’s impact, starting in 2019, to prevent the $15 rate from being reached and to achieve possibly a rollback of past rises.

In the meantime, manufacturers are mitigating their higher labor costs by not hiring and asking current employees to do more.

Autodyne Manufacturing Co. Inc. in Lindenhurst has raised its qualifications for job applicants and the responsibilities of existing workers.

“The expectation of the entry-level employee will be greater, thereby lessening the choices for the inexperienced candidate, such as our American youth just starting out in the workforce, from being hired,” said Lindsay A. Howe, owner of the small business, which makes spare parts for U.S. military equipment.

At some factories, the higher minimum wage has led to a re-examination of production space with an eye toward installing robots and moving work to low-cost countries.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc., a maker of rapid tests for HIV, Zika and other tropical diseases, is investing in machines to do some work on one of its six production lines. The company has 142 workers locally.

In January Chembio purchased RVR Diagnostics of Malaysia, where it plans to make tests for sale in Asia and Africa. New York’s new minimum wage “was a big factor” in the deal, said Klugewicz, the Americas division president.

“Businesses have to get creative,” she said. “We’re looking at automation, facilities that can manufacture products at a lower cost point, and cross training our existing workers so they can do different jobs.”",21/10/2017
NewsDay,"Excerpt from ‘The Rules of Magic,’ Alice Hoffman’s prequel to ‘Practical Magic’","Once upon a time, before the whole world changed, it was possible to run away from home, disguise who you were, and fit into polite society. The children’s mother had done exactly that. Susanna was one of the Boston Owenses, a family so old that the General Society of Mayflower Descendants and the Daughters of the American Revolution were unable to deny them admission to their exclusive organizations, despite the fact that they would have liked to close the door to them, locking it twice. Their original ancestor, Maria Owens, who had arrived in America in 1680, remained a mystery, even to her own family. No one knew who had fathered her child or could fathom how she came to build such a fine house when she was a woman alone with no apparent means of support. The lineage of those who followed Maria was equally dubious. Husbands disappeared without a trace. Daughters begat daughters. Children ran off and were never seen again.

In every generation there were those who fled Massachusetts, and Susanna Owens had done so. She had escaped to Paris as a young woman, then had married and settled in New York, denying her children any knowledge of their heritage for their own good, which left them with nagging suspicions about who they were. It was clear from the start that they were not like other children, therefore Susanna felt she had no choice but to set down rules. No walking in the moonlight, no Ouija boards, no candles, no red shoes, no wearing black, no going shoeless, no amulets, no night-blooming flowers, no reading novels about magic, no cats, no crows, and no venturing below Fourteenth Street. Yet no matter how Susanna tried to enforce these rules, the children continued to thwart her. They insisted upon being unusual. Eldest was Frances, with skin as pale as milk and blood-red hair, who early on had the ability to commune with birds, who flocked to her window as if called when she was still in her crib. Then came Bridget, called Jet due to her inky black tresses, a girl as shy as she was beautiful, who seemed to know what others were thinking. Last there was Vincent, the adored youngest child, a surprise in every way, the first and only boy to be born into the family, a gifted musician who whistled before he could talk, so charismatic and fearless his worried mother took to keeping him on a leash when he was a toddler, to prevent him from making an escape.

The children grew up quickly in the last years of the 1950s, their odd behavior increasing with time. They had no desire to play games and no interest in other children at the park. They sneaked out the windows of the family’s shabby town house on Eighty-Ninth Street on the Upper East Side after their parents went to bed, cavorting on the roof, scurrying down fire escapes, and, as time went on, wandering into Central Park at all hours. They wrote with black ink on the living room walls, read each other’s thoughts, and hid in the basement scullery, where their mother could never find them. As if it were their duty, they broke the rules one by one. Franny wore black and grew night-blooming jasmine on her windowsill, Jet read every novel written by E. Nesbit and fed stray cats in the alley, and Vincent began to venture downtown by the time he turned ten.

All three had the gray eyes the family was known for, but the sisters were opposites in every way. Frances was sulky and suspicious, while Jet was kindhearted and so sensitive that a negative remark could make her break into hives. Jet was fashionable, following in her mother’s stylish footsteps, but Frances was usually rumpled, her hair left uncombed.

She was happiest when her boots were muddy as she navigated the park, wandering through Sheep Meadow. Her gift with wild birds allowed her to bring them to her merely by lifting her hand. From a distance, when she ran so fast she was nearly flying, it seemed as if she spoke their language, and was meant for their world more than her own.

As for Vincent, he possessed such an unearthly charm that only hours after his birth a nurse in the maternity ward of Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital had tucked him into her coat in a failed kidnapping attempt. During her trial she’d told the court that the abduction was not her fault. She’d been spellbound, unable to resist him. As time went on, this wasn’t an unusual complaint. Vincent was spoiled rotten, treated by Jet as though he were a baby doll and by Frances as if he were a science experiment. If you pinched him, Frances wondered, would he cry? If you offered him a box of cookies, would he make himself sick by eating every one? Yes, it turned out, and yes again. When Vincent misbehaved, which was often, Frances made up stories filled with punishments for little boys who would not do as they were told, not that her cautionary tales stopped him. All the same, she was his protector and remained so even when he was far taller than she.

NewsDay,Chembio CEO returns to work Monday after heart transplant,"The CEO of a Medford company returned to work Monday after receiving a heart transplant because of a disease that’s been diagnosed only 300 times in more than 100 years.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. announced Monday that John J. Sperzel, 54, has resumed his duties as CEO and president after taking a medical leave on May 30.

Sharon Klugewicz, who had been acting CEO, returned to her post as president of operations in North America and South America, the company said.

Chembio employs about 130 people in Medford and Holbrook to develop and manufacture rapid diagnostic tests for HIV, syphilis, Zika, Ebola and other tropical diseases. The company reported a loss of $13.3 million last year on sales of $17.9 million.

“I was diagnosed with what’s considered a very rare [heart] disorder: giant cell myocarditis,” Sperzel said in an interview Sunday. “Ninety percent of the people that are diagnosed die or get a heart transplant in the first year. I got the blessing of the donor heart in time to save my life.”

There was no history of heart disease in his family and he hadn’t experienced significant medical problems before collapsing in May while on vacation in Aruba.

In mid-May, Sperzel was airlifted from Aruba to Baptist Hospital in Miami and eventually spent more than two months at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He has commuted to Long Island from his Maine home since joining Chembio in March 2014.

A medical team led by surgeon Dr. David A. D’Alessandro determined that Sperzel was in acute heart failure due to giant cell myocarditis.

The disorder, which occurs for unknown reasons, is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle, according to the National Organization of Rare Disorders. It was discovered in 1905.

Sperzel said the heart transplant came on July 8 after four previous surgeries. He was battling pneumonia and a dangerous blood clot at the time.

“The donor heart came in the nick of time because I was down to a week or so left to live,” he recalled.

Despite his illness, Sperzel spoke with Chembio officials daily from his hospital bed and during two months of rehabilitation.

“It wasn’t to try to be a superhero; it was because it kept me mentally sharp,” he said. “I believe that having the right attitude and having the right mental strength can help you survive what I went through.”

Sperzel said he plans to reach out to the donor’s family to express his gratitude and to work to raise awareness about organ donation. “Thousands of people die each year waiting for donor organs and I think we can do better,” he said.

Sperzel joins a small group of CEOs who have undergone heart transplants. Last year, United Airlines chief Oscar Munoz and U.S. Soccer chief Dan Flynn both received new hearts.",02/10/2017
NewsDay,Chembio’s Zika test approved for emergency use after hurricanes,"A Medford manufacturer has won federal approval for temporary use of its diagnostic test to combat a potential outbreak of the Zika virus in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Florida and Texas.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. said Thursday that the federal Food and Drug Administration has okayed the company’s rapid test for Zika and companion results monitor for “emergency use” by some laboratories responding to medical problems caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.

The FDA approval comes as health officials express concern about increased mosquito populations in the South and Caribbean after the hurricanes.

Some mosquitoes carry the Zika virus, which causes babies to be born with small heads.

Chembio’s blood test for Zika is the first of its kind to receive an FDA Emergency Use Authorization. The authorization allows the test to be used by labs that have been certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment to perform high or moderate complexity tests, according to Sharon Klugewicz, Chembio’s acting CEO.

She said the FDA approval was for a limited time.

“We believe the deployment of a rapid test for the presumptive detection . . . of [the] Zika virus will be a critical tool in dealing with the ongoing spread of Zika virus, and we plan to make the DPP Zika System immediately available in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,” she said.

Chembio developed the Zika test in part with federal funding, which could eventually total $13.2 million.

The company also has rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, malaria, Ebola and other tropical diseases.

Chembio shares rose 20 cents Thursday to close at $6.20 on the NASDAQ Stock Market. They are down 12 percent in the past 12 months.",28/09/2017
NewsDay,Stevie Wonder takes a knee at Global Citizen Festival in Central Park,"The Global Citizen Festival brought together music superstars Stevie Wonder and Green Day with political leaders, including Miroslav Lajcak, president of the United Nations General Assembly, in Central Park on Saturday to help end extreme poverty in the world by 2030.

Wonder started with a gesture aimed at President Donald Trump’s remarks about NFL players protesting by taking a knee during the national anthem.

“Tonight, I’m taking a knee for America,” Wonder said, as he slowly knelt on the stage. “I’m taking both knees. Both knees in prayer for our planet, our future, our leaders of the world.”

He then delivered a sweet, warmhearted set, including “Overjoyed” and “Sir Duke,” even before Pharrell Williams joined him for a funky set that included “Get Lucky,” “Superstition,” and “Happy.” But it was Wonder’s gorgeous version of John Lennon’s “Imagine” that will be the most-remembered moment from the evening.

Earlier, Whoopi Goldberg told the crowd of 60,000 on the Great Lawn, “This is how you change the world. You don’t have to wait for anybody. You can do it on your own.”

Green Day’s raucous set immediately brought the feeling to life. During “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” the crowd was screaming so loud it brought a smile to singer Billie Joe Armstrong’s face, saying, “That’s how it’s done in New York City, baby.”

Armstrong changed the lyrics to “American Idiot” to “I’m not a part of the Donald Trump America,” but the band’s main focus was to fight HIV and AIDS, dedicating the ballad “Wake Me Up When September Ends” to the battle.

It was all a part of the mix of music and social concerns that took place throughout the festival.

Andra Day brought activists from Uganda, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Jamaica onstage before her stunning soulful anthem “Rise Up.” She also discussed lynching after her version of Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit.”

In the middle of The Lumineers’ uplifting Americana set, Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, made a plea for donations to help build his island nations after the devastation of Hurricane Irma.

The Killers also embodied the spirit of the day, ripping through a string of their best-known songs such as “Mr. Brightside” and those championing the power of youth such as “When You Were Young,” rather than doing any songs from their new album “Wonderful, Wonderful,” which was released Friday.

Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans said that including this year’s concert, the organization in the past six years had secured $30 billion in commitments from governments and businesses to help end poverty, improving the lives of more than 1 billion people.

“We need to be better and we need to do more,” said Lajcak, who also quoted “Imagine.” “I need to hear your voices all over the world.”",23/09/2017
NewsDay,Michael Friedman dies; ‘Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson’ composer,"LOS ANGELES — Michael Friedman, an Obie-winning composer and lyricist known for the musicals “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” and “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” has died. He was 41.

Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis and Executive Director Patrick Willingham say Friedman passed away Saturday of complications related to HIV/AIDS in New York.

Friedman’s best-known work is the rock musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” which imagines the seventh president of the United States as an emo rock star. First performed in 2008, “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” opened on Broadway in September 2010 and closed in January 2011 after 120 performances.

Friedman was a co-founder of The Civilians and artist-in-residence and director of Public Forum at The Public Theater.

Eustis said in a statement that Friedman was one of the most brilliant, multitalented theater artists of our time.",10/09/2017
NewsDay,NY top court upholds ban on physician-assisted suicide,"ALBANY — New York’s highest court upheld the state’s ban on physician-assisted suicide Thursday, saying the state law doesn’t violate individuals’ constitutional rights.

The Court of Appeals, in a 5-0 decision, said a right to “aid in dying,” as asserted by advocates, was “not fundamental” and that the state’s ban on it didn’t violate due process protections. Further, the court noted the State Legislature has a “rational basis for criminalizing assisted suicide” — meaning doctors can be prosecuted for participating in a suicide.

“Although New York has long recognized a competent adult’s right to forgo life-saving medical care, we reject plaintiffs’ argument that an individual has a fundamental constitutional right to aid-in-dying as they define it. We also reject plaintiff’s assertion that the state’s prohibition on assisted suicide is not rationally related to legitimate state interests,” the five-judge panel wrote. [Two judges on the bench abstained because they had served on mid-level courts that handled the lawsuit earlier.]

The judges added that the state ban was clear: “The assisted suicide statutes apply to anyone who assists an attempted or completed suicide. There are no exceptions . . .”

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by a coalition led by three patients with terminal diagnoses. Steve Goldenberg, who has since died of HIV-related illness; Sara Myers, who has since died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease; and Eric Sieff, who is still being treated for cancer. They were joined by several groups, including the New York Civil Liberties Union and “End of Life Choices New York,” which advocates for “aid in dying.”

In oral arguments at the court earlier this year, they contended lower state courts had erred in applying a “dictionary definition of suicide” and upholding a century-old New York law against assisted suicide. They contended that the ban shouldn’t apply to those seeking an end to incurable diseases.

Advocates called the decision a “significant blow” but vowed to pursue change through the State Legislature — where they have been campaigning for repeal for several years.

“We will continue to fight to establish the right to aid in dying in the New York State Legislature, so that we can join the six other states and the District of Columbia” where assisted suicide is legal, said Laurie Leonard, director of End of Life Choices New York.

The Catholic Conference, which represents Catholic bishops of New York, applauded the outcome.

“Moreover, the court ruled that there is an important and logical distinction between refusing life-sustaining treatment and actively assisting in suicide, a distinction our Catholic tradition has always recognized,” said Kathleeen Gallagher of the Catholic Conference. “The decision is a significant victory for those who would be most at risk of abuse and most susceptible to pressure to take their own lives, including the isolated elderly, persons with disabilities, and those who are depressed and overcome with hopelessness.”

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office defended the state ban, declined to comment.",08/09/2017
NewsDay,How not to handle the opioid crisis,"President Donald Trump announced this month that he intends to formally declare a state of emergency regarding America’s opioid crisis, which a White House advisory panel told him has reached unprecedented, catastrophic proportions. Many Americans eye Trump’s pronouncements warily, as they usually begin by stating a problem most of us agree is genuine and then swiftly veer into wild territory that seems to pop out of the president’s fertile imagination.

So here, Mr. President, are some basic solutions to the opioid crisis. Your advisory commission gave you many sage recommendations, which you should seriously weigh. Your Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis was especially focused on preventing overdose deaths and helping people get off narcotics. But when you announced your intention to follow the commission’s primary recommendation by declaring an emergency, you added: “The best way to prevent drug addiction and overdose is to prevent people from abusing drugs in the first place . . . So we can keep them from going on, and maybe by talking to youth and telling them: ‘No good, really bad for you in every way.’ ”

If your strategy is to stop addiction in the first place, rather than bring compassionate care and survival to those already using narcotics, you will distress first responders and emergency room professionals across the nation. They processed 142 overdose deaths per day in America in 2015 — a toll expected to soar when newer 2016-2017 statistics are tallied. That year, more than 52,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses, and early data indicates that the toll topped 60,000 in 2016.

Four years ago, before the dramatic surge in opioid use, deaths, hospitalizations, and productivity losses nationwide were estimated to cost some $78.5 billion. That’s likely low, as it understates hospitalization fees, which have skyrocketed: In 2014, alone, opioids accounted for 1.27 million emergency room visits nationwide. Also missing from this calculus are the costs of treatment and deaths soaring nationwide from needle-sharing among the addicted, spreading HIV, all forms of hepatitis, and a long list of other infections. You need only look to Vice President Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana, which is in the grips of the nation’s fastest-growing HIV epidemic, fueled by needle use that started during his tenure as governor.

Two policy directions

Mr. President, even you noted in your remarks that “drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, and opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since 1999.”

But let’s take your vow to “prevent people from abusing drugs in the first place” seriously.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

You list two policy directions — boost law enforcement against drug dealers and users committing crimes that endanger the public and tighten security at the border with Mexico. Reminiscent of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush’s war on drugs, the approach blames Mexico and criminalizes drug users.

We’ve been there before, and it hasn’t worked, though it did substantially increase the size of our prison and jail populations, to the point where we lead the entire world for the numbers of people incarcerated. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2015 there were 2.2 million adults in prisons and jails in this country, and another 4.65 million were on parole or probation. That same year, in the juvenile incarceration system, almost 50,000 kids are imprisoned. The number of incarcerated has more than quadrupled since 1980 and the start of the war on drugs, witnessing a twelvefold increase in the numbers of Americans imprisoned for nonviolent drug offenses. By 2000, 22 percent of all federal and state prisoners were convicted for drug use, possession, or sale. Soon states were spending more on prisons than schools, as the costs of incarcerating thousands of marijuana smokers and those convicted of petty cocaine possession soared, topping $1 trillion in 2016. As judges and prosecutors around the country came to see that the war on drugs was merely creating overcrowded prisons and an entire class of underemployed and unemployable ex-con Americans - especially black and Latino men - prison sentencing for petty nonviolent drug crimes fell. Today, about 16 percent of our nation’s incarcerated prisoners were convicted for nonviolent drug-related crimes.

That “round ’em up and corral ’em” approach didn’t work. Let’s not go down that path again.

Smart ways of tackling problem

Here are some simple alternatives.

Target the lawful manufacturers.

Unlike the heroin that swept America during the Vietnam War, the cocaine that filled the noses of disco dancers in the 1980s, and the crack marketed in poor urban communities in the 1990s, today’s gateway drugs are manufactured by legitimate pharmaceutical companies, most of them located within the United States. The companies are making profits without apparent concern about how their products are used.

Across America, attorneys general and local district attorneys have filed lawsuits against the pharmaceutical giants that make fentanyl, Percocet, OxyContin, Opana, oxycodone, and other synthetic opioids - compounds that are up to 10,000 times more addictive than medical-grade morphine. These suits are coming from red and blue states alike — places like Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kentucky and New York. The suits allege that companies like Purdue Pharma (manufacturer of OxyContin) and Endo (maker of Percocet and Opana) knowingly downplay the addiction risk of their products when marketing the drugs to physicians and provide financial incentives to doctors to promote prescriptions. The suits stipulate that the manufacturers — pharmaceutical giants like Mylan, Johnson & Johnson, and Teva Pharmaceuticals — know full well that they are selling far more of their products than are legitimately used to alleviate pain.

Distributors are also being targeted with legal action. For example, the Cherokee Nation is suing retailers CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart and drug distributors McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen for flooding the Native American community with prescription opioids “in quantities that far exceeded the number of prescriptions that could reasonably have been used for legitimate medical purposes,” according to the lawsuit. The Cherokee claim underscores the profits drugstores and retailers are making off the crisis.

Consider these examples, Mr. President. Drugstores in tiny Clay County, Kentucky, (population 21,000) filled 2.2 million doses of prescriptions for hydrocodone, plus 617,000 doses of oxycodone in 2016. Assuming all those doses were used by county residents, that translates to 134 prescriptions per man, woman, and child per year. Either the poor folks living in Clay County are wracked by an extraordinary level of collective physical pain or all those pharmacists know full well that they are feeding addictions. In another example, authorities are asking why West Virginia’s whistle-stop town of Kermit (population 392) received 9 million doses of hydrocodone in 2015-2016, shipped to a single drugstore; surely, the manufacturer and distributor knew this was suspicious.

Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo.) charges: “This epidemic is the direct result of a calculated sales and marketing strategy major opioid manufacturers have allegedly pursued over the past 20 years to expand their market share and increase dependency on powerful — and often deadly — painkillers.”

Mr. President, if you are serious about stopping America’s opioid crisis, instruct Attorney General Jeff Sessions to have the Department of Justice join in these legal actions, bringing the investigatory and legal weight of the FBI to battle the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical opioid industry and the largest distributors and retailers of the drugs. Don’t waste federal resources on isolated overprescribing doctors and puny drugstores — the states can handle those cases. Tell Sessions to nip this tsunami in the bud by going after entities that garner more than a billion dollars a year off opioids.

Stop the export of America’s opioid crisis.

Since 2010, OxyContin sales have fallen 40 percent in the United States, as rival synthetic opioids have gained popularity. And thanks in part to Rush Limbaugh’s notorious addiction and drug arrest in 2006, the product has lost favor among would-be consumers and prescribing physicians. But that hasn’t stopped drugmakers from finding friendlier markets: The Los Angeles Timesrevealed an elaborate scheme on the part of the manufacturer Purdue to offshore both production and sales, targeting Mexico, Latin America, Russia, China, and Indonesia. In May, a dozen members of Congress sent a letter to the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), warning that Purdue and its subsidiary Mundipharma International were exporting America’s opioid crisis abroad. “The international health community has the rare opportunity to see the future,” the letter warned, saying opioid export will increase and related addictions and deaths will likely “follow the same pattern as in the United States,” due to “irresponsible-and potentially criminal-marketing of prescription opioids.”

Mr. President, America cannot become the world’s addictive drug supplier. Our foreign policy and reputation have taken enough blows; you must not let U.S. pharmaceutical makers and drug retailers become the 21st-century Medellín cartel. You don’t want to be the 2017 version of the Colombian political leaders rendered laughingstocks by Pablo Escobar, who made hundreds of millions of dollars from cocaine exportation but tainted his country’s image in the process. You should instruct your Commerce Department and Drug Enforcement Agency to collaborate in efforts to identify U.S.-based drugmakers that are building opioid export and trade deals and identify means to limit overseas sales to actual medicinal use for immediate pain relief.

Stop the import of fake and copycat foreign-made opioids.

In 2015, under pressure from the Barack Obama administration’s DEA, the Chinese government put 116 synthetic opioids on its controlled substances list. Clever Chinese drugmakers simply made minor changes in the chemistry of drugs like fentanyl, making the molecules different from those Beijing and Washington sought to regulate and, in some cases, rendering the drugs more powerful and addictive.

This year, Ohio saw an enormous spike in overdose deaths cause by Carfentanil, an opioid elephant tranquilizer manufactured by a Chinese lab. Left off Beijing’s controlled substances list, the drug is made and exported legally. When it hit the streets of Cincinnati in late 2016, the morgues started filling up. After Beijing added Carfentanil to its enforcement list, the makers simply went underground — joining the vast criminal laboratory network across China that makes fake Viagra, substandard antimalarial drugs, HIV “medicines” with no active ingredients, and phony blood thinners that kill cardiac patients.

The thriving fake drug industry dumps about $100 billion worth of bad products into the U.S. market annually, often with deadly consequences. Criminal labs exist all over the world, but the No. 1 supplier is China, with India hot on its heels. For example, the WHO estimates that in several African countries half of all drugs sold, including antimalarials, are fake medicines — most made in China or India. In China, the problem is so out of control that even the nation’s own military hospitals have fallen prey, unknowingly purchasing phony drugs and vaccines that have hurt or killed Chinese soldiers.

The DEA warns that unusually potent opioids made in China are now flooding U.S. markets. Bad as legitimately made fentanyl may be, the DEA says the Chinese drugs are far worse: more potent and more addictive. And the Chinese makers are openly shipping supplies to American drugstores, physicians, and even individuals via FedEx and other mailing services. In March, law enforcement officials seized 36 pounds of Chinese super-fentanyl that was mailed to New Jersey. Similar interdictions in posted Chinese fake fentanyl supplies have recently been made in New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Alaska, and Illinois — actually, in every state where the DEA has mounted a serious investigation. Nevertheless, addictive Chinese drugs can be ordered online and have been shipped to North America inside such things as printer ink cartridges.

Inside India, the use of all sorts of opium-derived painkillers is strictly limited, to the degree that it can be very difficult for cancer patients and other sufferers of acute pain to obtain alleviation. Like most people worldwide who are in acute pain and legitimately need relief, Indians cannot easily acquire morphine, any opioids, or even basic analgesics. But that doesn’t mean that India’s enormous pharmaceutical industry is missing out on opioid profits: Some have mirrored the Chinese practices, and their versions of OxyContin, fentanyl, and other drugs have reached the American market.

Effective targeting

Mr. President, your admirers enjoy your get-tough approach to foreigners. But you need to direct your muscle to the proper targets. America’s street opioids aren’t coming across the Mexican border but through the mail from China and India. You should tell your diplomatic and trade negotiators in multiple federal agencies to let Beijing and New Delhi know that this will not be tolerated. Go ahead, get tough. When the DEA or local law enforcement identifies foreign-made opioids for sale online or distributed in the United States, notification must be directed immediately to counterparts in the countries of origin, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson must insist that the respective governments arrest the manufacturers and distributors.

Some of your advisers, Mr. President, may be telling you that you should use the opioid state of emergency as reason to crack down on marijuana, fill our prisons with nonviolent drug offenders, and snarl at Mexico. They are wrong. Go after the real sources of America’s crisis — the drugmakers, distributors, and retailers inside the country and overseas — and bring them to their knees. If you do so, tens of thousands of American lives will be saved, small towns across Appalachia and the Midwest will come back to life, and you will be rightly praised. But handle this state of emergency the wrong way, and you will see the death tolls rise, prison populations swell, and the reputation of the United States as the planet’s addiction supplier solidified.

You don’t want that, do you?

NewsDay,Wildflowers planted at Bethpage State Park to aid honey bees,"Leah Nakamori is afraid of bees, but on Saturday the 8-year-old from Farmingdale was planting a flower in a garden at Bethpage State Park as hundreds of the insects buzzed around her.

She has learned that bees — which are declining in population worldwide — are a critical part of the ecosystem and need flowers to survive.

“I feel like this helps us get food,” she said of her help in expanding the garden. “Without bees, we’d have nothing to eat.”

Leah joined other kids and adults in planting dozens of wildflowers at the park’s pollinator garden to mark National Honey Bee Day. She and her Girl Scout troop helped plant 1,000 flowers in the spring.

The Bethpage garden began in 2015 and continues to expand, this year with the help of a grant from Bayer AG’s crop science division. The German company, with U.S. headquarters in North Carolina, sponsored Saturday’s event and similar ones in California and Illinois.

Beekeeper Grace Mehl was on hand to explain the importance of bees — and how wildflowers that Long Islanders can plant in their own gardens can help feed them. About a third of the food we eat is produced by honeybees, she said.

“If you did not have pollinators, you would not have [most of] your fruits and vegetables, even things like onions that you wouldn’t think need bees,” she said.

Mehl and fellow beekeeper Moira Alexander care for five hives elsewhere in the park.

Suburbanization leads to a loss of bee habitat, and reduction in habitat is a key reason why the commercial honeybee population in the United States is declining, along with parasites, pests, pathogens and pesticides, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Much of the flowering vegetation in residents’ yards on Long Island blooms at roughly the same time, in the spring. The Bethpage pollinator garden at the edge of a baseball field has more variety, with flowers that bloom for months, providing nectar for bees throughout the summer, said park horticulturalist Victor Azzaretto.

Leah’s mom, Jessica Nakamori, 32, said she wants her daughter and 3-year-old son, Jack, to understand the importance of bees.

“It’s up to our future generation to have food that’s sustainable,” she said. “The bees are in danger. Without them, there won’t be anything for us.”",19/08/2017
NewsDay,Hundreds on East End get meat allergy from Lone Star tick’s bite,"Hundreds of people on the East End have become allergic to red meat in recent years after being bitten by the Lone Star tick, with scattered cases cropping up elsewhere across Long Island, medical experts say.

The condition — called alpha-gal allergy — has transformed some people who have eaten red meat for decades into patients under doctors’ orders to abstain from all meat from mammals, including beef, pork, lamb, goat, rabbit and venison. Patients are subject to hives, rapid heart palpitations, pervasive itching and, in the worst and rarest of cases, life-threatening anaphylactic shock.

Alpha-gal allergy is relatively new to medicine, first described in 2009 by a physician-scientist at the University of North Carolina. It has morphed into a global public health concern, with Long Island as one of the disorder’s leading focal points. At the same time, the region is seeing an explosion in the population of the Lone Star tick, a transplant from the Deep South.

“I have been treating people with this allergy since 2010,” said Dr. Erin McGintee, an allergist in Southampton who was the first physician to identify the condition on the Island and now has nearly 400 patients with the allergy.

“My youngest patient is 3 years old and I have patients in their 80s and 90s,” she said. “I see patients of all ages, and they are evenly distributed between males and females.”

As with people who are allergic to peanuts, epinephrine is the prescribed treatment, usually through an auto-injector such as an EpiPen.

Bug produces sugar

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The allergy occurs because the blood-sucking bug produces a sugar that humans do not possess — galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or in short, alpha-gal, McGintee said.

Ticks, well-known as carriers of microbes, have a slurry of compounds in their saliva, including anesthetic chemicals that blunt their bite.

In the case of Lone Star ticks, the alpha-gal compound is injected directly into the host’s bloodstream, where the body perceives the sugar as foreign and produces armies of antibodies to fight it.

The same sugar also occurs in mammalian meats. Normally, people digest alpha-gal from meat sources. But once antibodies have been produced because of a tick bite, the potent warrior forces of the immune system are activated whenever the sugar is present.

For those who eat red meat, even the smallest meatball or a soup laced with beef stock can unleash an outsized immune system reaction. Ingestion of chicken and fish, which are not mammalian, does not cause an immune response after tick bites, McGintee said.

In Montauk, Heather D’Agostino, 48, had no idea her formidable symptoms in October 2015 were related to the filet mignon she ate at a restaurant.

“I woke up in the middle of the night. The palms of my hands and soles of my feet were unbelievably itchy,” D’Agostino said. “Then, I realized my throat was swelling and that I was having an acute anaphylactic reaction.”

D’Agostino scrambled to find something — anything — to ease her worsening symptoms. She had a pediatric over-the-counter medication on hand. “I drank two child doses of Benadryl, two shots, and that worked.”

She doesn’t know when she was bitten by ticks. Now, she encourages friends and acquaintances on the East End to carry the antihistamine with them at all times — just in case.

The East End may well be Long Island’s alpha-gal epicenter. McGintee said residents often encounter Lone Stars, so named because of the prominent white spot on the adult female’s back. Males do not have that distinguishing feature.

The ticks bite even while in the larval stage, McGintee said. At that point of the bug’s development, its bite is virtually imperceptible.

“I don’t want there to be mass hysteria about this,” the allergist said, “but I think that people should know that this is a food allergy, it’s not an illness.”

The allergy wanes over time, McGintee said, but a new Lone Star tick bite can cause symptoms to rebound.

Still, the condition has forced some people into emergency rooms. Almost all patients who have been diagnosed carry an auto-injector, in the event they inadvertently encounter a meal with traces of red meat.

“When I go to friends’ houses I always carry an EpiPen,” said Gregory Baum, 17, who lives in the North Haven area of Sag Harbor. He suffered a serious reaction to red meat last year when he visited his sister in Philadelphia.

“I like going there because of the [Philly] cheesesteak sandwiches,” Baum said.

But hours after a meal, he awoke sick and nauseated, breaking out in hives. His mom got an over-the-counter antihistamine, and eventually the aggressive symptoms subsided.

Baum, who was diagnosed with alpha-gal, said he doesn’t remember being bitten, though he was in plenty of tick-rich locations. An avid golfer, he often has driven balls into the high fescue grass alongside the course he frequents. Baum said he is well aware of ticks and other creepy crawlers in the grass.

Dr. Scott Campbell, chief of the Arthropod-borne Disease Laboratory in Yaphank, a division of the Suffolk County Department of Health, said the Lone Star tick, while not native to Long Island, probably has been here since the 1970s. The bug feeds voraciously on deer and began expanding its range in the 1990s, he said.

“The most plausible theory is that this tick was brought in by migrating birds, and the East End is well-known for its bird diversity,” Campbell said.

Over time, the Lone Star, which also can transmit the bacterium that causes the infectious disease ehrlichiosis, has become established on the East End and is making its way west.

“This tick is not shy,” Campbell said, noting that early-stage ticks bite to get mammalian blood in order to grow. Among adults, only the Lone Star female bites to get blood that aids egg maturation. Adult males attach but have no interest in bloodmeals, he said.

Second-largest caseload

McGintee’s caseload of alpha-gal patients is the second-largest outside the South, the Lone Star’s original habitat.

She works closely with Dr. Scott Commins of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who has more than 600 patients, the largest number worldwide. Commins, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics, was the first to draw a link between tick bites and the red meat allergy.

“My understanding had been that this was more of a Gulf Coast, Bible Belt, Southern state tick,” Commins said. “But it has expanded its range and they are now finding it in Minnesota, Indiana and of course Long Island.”

Alpha-gal allergy is being reported elsewhere in the world, he said, although the condition in other countries appears to be caused by different types of ticks.

The allergy is a dramatic departure from other food intolerances, Commins said.

With allergies to peanuts or eggs, the immune system’s response is triggered by a reaction to proteins and is immediate. For those with alpha-gal allergy, Commins said, the trigger is a complex sugar and the adverse response can take hours, long after the meal has been consumed. Fat in the meat probably slows the reaction time, he said.

“It’s a massive departure from everything we have known about food allergies,” Commins said. “Not only do you start with the idea that a sugar can lead to a systemic allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, but an adult who has eaten beef, pork or lamb for 40, 50, 60 years can suddenly become allergic.”",17/08/2017
NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics reports smaller loss, higher sales","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. reported Wednesday a smaller loss for the April-June period compared with a year earlier because of higher sales and the absence of a one-time tax charge in 2016.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, Ebola, Zika and other diseases said it lost $2.2 million in the three months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $8.4 million a year earlier.

Nearly $6 million of the 2016 loss was due to an accounting provision related to a so-called “deferred tax asset” that Chembio wasn’t able to use because it’s not profitable.

Sales for the April-June period totaled $4 million, a 26 percent increase from a year earlier.

“During the second quarter of 2017, we achieved significant product sales growth within all of our target regions,” including a 187.1 percent increase in Europe, more than 40 percent in Asia and South America, 22 percent in Africa and 8 percent in the United States compared with April-June 2016, said Sharon Klugewicz, the company’s acting CEO.

In the quarter, Chembio won a $5.8 million order from Brazil to supply HIV test components and test kits, and secured approval to begin selling a Zika test and results reader in that country, which has been the hardest hit by the disease that causes birth defects.

Klugewicz said Wednesday that Chembio hopes to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell a combination test for HIV and syphilis after a clinical trial is completed this year. It’s also seeking FDA approval for the Zika test.

The earnings announcement came after the stock market close. Chembio shares closed down 15 cents, or more than 2 percent, to $6.15 on the NASDAQ stock market. They are down more than 14 percent over the past 12 months.",09/08/2017
NewsDay,Report: Underground haven for drug users operating in U.S.,"NEW YORK — A safe haven where drug users inject themselves with heroin and other drugs has been quietly operating in the United States for the past three years, a report reveals.

None were known to exist in the U.S. until the disclosure in a medical journal, although several states and cities are pushing to establish these so-called supervised injection sites where users can shoot up under the care of trained staff who can treat an overdose if necessary.

In the report released Tuesday, two researchers said they’ve been evaluating an underground safe place that opened in 2014. As a condition of their research, they didn’t disclose the location of the facility — which is unsanctioned and potentially illegal — or the social service agency running it.

The researchers offered little data, and their main finding was that no one died while injecting at the safe place. There were two overdoses on site, which were reversed by staff members using the overdose medication naloxone.

Advocates and some politicians in recent years have called for government-sanctioned injection sites as the U.S. grapples with the opioid epidemic. More than 52,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015 — the most ever — fueled by soaring abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers. Government statistics for the first nine months of last year, also released Tuesday, show overdose death rates continuing to spiral.

Some say the new report could have an impact on efforts to establish safe injection sites around the U.S. Such sites have been backed by lawmakers in New York, California and other states, along with officials in cities like Seattle, San Francisco and Ithaca, New York.

“It shows people that it’s possible” to operate one of these in the U.S., said Lindsay LaSalle, an attorney with Drug Policy Alliance who has helped draft safe haven legislative proposals in six states.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Injection sites are legal in countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland where medical professionals monitor drug users. They also provide clean needles to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis C. Ideally, they also steer users into treatment and other services.

Some experts say new approaches are needed to fight the opioid epidemic, including safe havens. But they’ve faced legal and political hurdles. Critics have argued these places may undermine prevention and treatment, and seem to fly in the face of laws aimed at stopping use of deadly illicit drugs.

Safe injection sites are different from syringe exchange programs, which were once controversial but now exist in 33 states.

The underground safe haven is open between four and six hours a day, five days a week, according to Alex Kral, a San Francisco-based researcher with RTI International, and Peter Davidson of the University of California, San Diego. Their report was published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The space consists of two rooms — an “injection room” with five stainless steel stations with mirrors and stools and a room next door where users are monitored afterward. There are trained staff on hand, but no one who is medically licensed, according to the researchers. Smoking is not allowed there, but drugs like heroin, pain pills, cocaine and methamphetamine are.

Use of the space was by invitation only. Most visitors are white, homeless men. It was used 2,500 times over two years by over 100 people, although researchers say the exact number of participants isn’t known because the facility relies on anonymous surveys.

There’s no data on deaths or drug use by clients who injected when the site was closed and it’s not known whether any went into treatment, Kral said.

The study also didn’t look at issues opponents worry about, like whether creation of a safe place is associated with an increase in people beginning to try drugs, said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University who nonetheless applauded the organization’s effort to try to stop overdose deaths.",08/08/2017

The recently erected PSEG Long Island poles in Eastport should be removed, and the lines should be buried [“PSEG’s ‘final offer’ to bury line,” News, July 21].

The utility poles installed by PSEG Long Island are out of character with the hamlet of Eastport. These poles, however, are just the latest assault on our community. The ambience of Eastport was already destroyed when Brookhaven Town erected 15, 60- and 70-foot poles at the Eastport South Manor Athletic Complex, next to my street. I find town officials’ outrage and hand-wringing over the PSEG poles to be hypocritical.

PSEG says it met with town officials about the plans to erect the poles; however, Brookhaven Town Councilman Dan Panico says that is a lie. This story sounds familiar. Brookhaven never notified the residents of our street of plans to erect the poles at the sports complex.

When I look to my right, I see the complex poles. When I look to my left, I see the PSEG poles. At least the PSEG poles aren’t accompanied by screaming fans and lights shining into bedrooms.

Long-held hopes for a better LIRR

I commend the agreement to improve the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road through Nassau County [“LI’s future is on the right track,” Editorial, July 23]. The third track will help all of the Island.

I fondly recall my youth, in the 1950s and ’60s, on the railroad with my father, who was a trainman and conductor. Back then, my father talked about the need for the third track on the Main Line.

With further upgrades, I’d like to imagine, as he did, trains leaving Penn Station and getting to Jamaica in 15 minutes, Hicksville in 30, Ronkonkoma in 45 and Riverhead in an hour.

And I hope I can see the new Penn Station in my lifetime.

People need safe places to take needles

Syringes from drug users are being found at beaches, parks, ballfields and other places where children could be stuck and exposed to hepatitis, HIV or remnants of drugs [“Now an epidemic of used syringes,” Health & Science, July 19].

We need to reduce access to needles and syringes. I was prescribed medication that required a number of injections a day. The hospital told me to return used syringes to the prescribing doctor or the pharmacy that filled the prescription. My husband bought a sharps container at the pharmacy. When it was filled, we took it to the hospital.

The hospital, pharmacy and doctor all initially refused to take the container. The Nassau County Board of Health told me to put the needles into a can with a lid or into a soap bottle and put them in the household trash. How secure is that?

We need to keep these out of the garbage stream. A collection place in each town might make it harder for addicts to find syringes and help prevent illegal drug use.

Trump, Clinton actions aren’t equivalent

A letter writer created a false equivalency by trying to compare the meeting of Trump campaign staff with a Russian lawyer to a $500,000 speech given by Bill Clinton to Russian bankers [“Russian ‘collusion’ grabs attention,” Letters, July 26].

A private citizen speaking for a fee and a presidential campaign meeting with a hostile foreign country to get information to sway an election are not comparable. The writer can leave the job of making those connections to President Donald Trump, whose obsession with Hillary Clinton borders on pathological.

The writer also engaged in hyperbole when he wrote that the media are “outraged” about the meeting with the Russian lawyer. The media aren’t outraged; they are reporting facts about the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with a foreign power to influence the American presidential election.

What has created outrage are the changing stories told by Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner. Let’s not make this about the Clintons.

NewsDay,Lynbrook beekeepers stung by village’s bee seizure,"Two Lynbrook beekeepers say they plan to sue the village after officials seized their hive and 20,000 bees last month, calling it an “infestation.”

Daryl Altman, 61, and her partner, Robert Shepard, 58, have kept bees in a box hive in their backyard since April 2016. Lynbrook Mayor William J. Hendrick said the seizure occurred after the village received a neighbor’s report of bees swarming in their garage and children’s play equipment, adding that the village assumed the bees on the neighbor’s property came from Altman’s hive.

Acting on a section of village code that says “grounds, buildings and structures shall be maintained free of insect, vermin and rodent harborage and infestation,” officials sent notices to Altman requesting to inspect the property.

Altman’s attorney, J. Lee Snead of Bellport, wrote back to the village, saying the bees were not an infestation, and the village employee or consultant was not allowed to enter the property or remove anything from it.

“You cannot construe a well-kept beehive as an infestation,” Altman said. “Those bees were like our pets, they were like our pals.”

Prompted by a doormat at Altman and Shepard’s front door that reads “Come back with a warrant,” officials obtained a search warrant from the village court justice, Village Attorney Peter Ledwith said.

On June 26, village officials — including a police officer — and a beekeeper seized the hive and vacuumed up about 20,000 bees while the couple was at work. The bees were taken to the Queens County Farm Museum. The village then sent Altman a bill for $308.50 for the removal and returned the empty hive to Altman, which she keeps in the backyard.

“It’s really like our cemetery, it’s like a memorial out there,” she said. “We want to be able to keep bees and we want other people to be able to keep bees.”

Hendrick called the bees “dangerous” and said residents could get stung and go into anaphylactic shock from an allergic reaction. Village documents, including the search warrant addressed to Altman, which she provided to Newsday, do not report any bee stings related to her hive, and Hendrick also said he was not aware of any stingings.

“In a residential area, it’s not allowed,” Hendrick said. “It’s not like a trained bee will go to its master.”

Village officials and the couple gave differing accounts about how many times inspectors went to the home and if they discussed the situation before the bees were removed.

Altman and Shepard say they plan to sue soon, but they have not yet decided in which court to file, Altman said. James Doan, a member of the Empire State Honey Producers Association’s board of directors, said he’s never heard of a government seizing bees.

Local governments may have their own laws about beekeeping operations within their boundaries, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture and Markets. She added that while the department “works closely” with beekeepers across the state, it “does not directly regulate hobby beekeepers” under state law.

There are about 3,000 hobby beekeepers in New York, according to state Department of Agriculture and Markets estimates. The department did not have an estimate of how many are on Long Island.",30/07/2017
NewsDay,Beekeeping master Rich Blohm has a honey of a hobby,"This time of year, Rich Blohm can be found in his garden apiary, tending to his 50 beehives and 20 bee breeding boxes. “The honey flow has just started with the blooming of the black locust trees,” says Blohm, a master beekeeper in Huntington, who’s been at his favored pastime for 44 years. “I make sure they have adequate room to store the honey that’s coming in.”

It’s a sweet hobby for Blohm, whose bees produce about 1,500 pounds of honey each year. Blohm sells the bee nectar for $12 a pound from a small roadside stand on the corner of his property. Buyers pay on the honor system. But Blohm isn’t looking for new customers. His honey has a loyal fan base and, without advertising, every season is a sellout, he says.

Though summer is the busiest time for him, Blohm’s beekeeping season begins in March, when he checks each hive to ensure it has enough food stores, or honey, to live on before nectar and pollen become available. The season continues until the end of autumn.

In addition to raising queen bees, Blohm, 72, who is semi retired from a pest-control business he owns, can be found imparting his expertise on all things bees with enthusiastic students in classes he’s been teaching for the past eight years. (See box.)

At Blohm’s recent advanced beekeeping class at Huntington’s Conklin Barn, he began with a TED Talk video of “Still Alice” author Lisa Genova, speaking about Alzheimer’s and how to curtail debilitating effects from the disease. “This has nothing to do with bees, but it has everything to do with bees,” says Blohm, who agrees with experts who say that keeping busy and challenging your mind can ward off cognitive decline.

Blohm’s agenda includes discussing an article about replacing queen bees and reviewing innovations in apiary equipment. The class of 13 beekeepers buzzes with the apiarists bringing up various concerns and voicing opinions.

“It’s a battle of the young master beekeeper with the old master beekeeper,” quips Cliff Struhl, 61, of Syosset, as Blohm and a student get into a lively discussion about what to feed queen bees.

In addition to delving into the history and biology of bees, Blohm’s lessons explore queen rearing, swarming of colonies and the dance language of bees. As the mother of all the other bees, the queen is the most important bee in the hive, Blohm explains. A priority for beekeepers is learning how to treat parasitic mites, which, if left unchecked, will eventually decimate the bee colony. “I tell my new beekeepers, ‘You thought you came into this and are going to learn about one insect. You really have to learn about two and at equal levels,’” he says.

One new beekeeper, Ellen Jean Dwyer, 85, of Northport, started in Blohm’s beginner class last September. “I had been interested in doing something constructive and trying to help the bees and ecology,” Dwyer says.

Caring for her bees, which arrived last spring from Blohm, who purchased them from a breeder in California, proved rather challenging, Dwyer says, though somewhat less difficult than she imagined. “So far they seem to be very industrious and happy, and working very hard at making honeycombs.”

Dwyer says she will continue her classes with Blohm and also plans to join the Long Island Beekeepers Club (longislandbeekeepers.org). “You’re always looking for more information, and it’s great to keep up that way,” she says.

Blohm loved growing things as a young boy in Woodside, Queens. One of his favorite pastimes was breeding tropical fish. “I love nature. I love caring for things,” he says.

Years later, Blohm became immersed in the world of bees through a friend. He, like Blohm, loved gardening, and was an ardent apiarist. “By the next year, I had my own bees and I was a beekeeper,” Blohm says. “He introduced me to beekeeping and then I got so interested in it and read so much, I became his source of information. He would call me and ask me what to do. I was just reading everything I could possibly get my hands on — I was so passionate about it.”

Beekeeping involves physical labor from moving hives around, and there are always new things to learn, he says. “It’s a real, all- encompassing hobby.”

Blohm doesn’t wear protective clothing when working with his hives. The first time he was stung, he says, “My arm swelled up to my shoulder.” But decades later, being stung has become a nonissue for him. “I’ve been doing it for so long, a couple of stings never bother me,” he says. “The pain doesn’t last that long — two minutes or so — and then I don’t even know where I got stung.”

Blohm may have been predisposed toward beekeeping: His great-grandfather, who ran an estate for a baron in Germany, kept bees to treat his arthritis. Although an unproven therapy, the venom from a bee’s sting is reported to help ease joint pain and other ailments, according to MedicineNet.com.

Blohm has been a certified master beekeeper since 1987. He earned his credentials from the Eastern Apicultural Society of North America (easternapiculture.org). Of the 200 or so beekeepers on Long Island, only seven are master beekeepers, says George Schramm, 52, president of the Long Island Beekeepers Club. Blohm is a board member and past president of the group.

Part of the responsibilities of a master beekeeper is to pass along knowledge, says Schramm, who lives in Lake Ronkonkoma. “Having somebody who has collected that much information and knowledge about beekeeping and is willing to share, is very important to beekeeping and to other beekeepers.”

Three of Blohm’s advanced students will be taking the master beekeeping exam next month at the Eastern Apicultural Society’s annual meeting in Delaware, including Moira Alexander, 66, of Smithtown. Of Blohm, Alexander says, “He’s an encyclopedia of information for beekeepers. He’s the go-to guy for information and understanding of situations within the hive.” Noting that Blohm is always learning and attending conferences on the subject of bees, Alexander says dryly, “Watching YouTube doesn’t make you a good beekeeper.”

Blohm is known in bee circles for his expertise, says Kim Flottum, editor-in-chief of Bee Culture Magazine. A few companies that invent new beekeeping equipment ask Blohm to try our their gadgets’ effectiveness, notes Flottum. “If you make a mistake, he’s going to tell you about it in a nice way. And then he’ll tell you how to fix it.”

Blohm’s enthusiasm for bees stems from his philosophy that everything bees do is beneficial to man. (He takes a heaping spoonful of honey in his tea every day.) Bees, he says, are responsible for a third of our food supply through pollination of fruits and vegetables. Honey is good for us, and Blohm notes that of all the sweeteners, it uses the least amount of energy to get to the consumer. Beeswax, yet another benefit of bees, is used in candles and as a substitute for paraffin in hypoallergenic cosmetics.

Blohm believes life is sweeter when people follow their passion as he has, whether it’s raising bees or something else that captures their interest. “I think that’s a wonderful thing to have in life and to pursue it,” he says.",29/07/2017
NewsDay,Sun allergies: What to watch out for,"Can a person be allergic to the sun?

Mayo Clinic dermatologist Dr. Dawn Davis says the sun can cause a variety of reactions when it comes in contact with your skin. Some skin conditions prompted by sun exposure are rare, but others happen frequently, especially in summer.

This time of year, many of us head outside to enjoy the sunshine. Nowadays, we all know it’s important to wear sunscreen to prevent sunburn, which is linked to skin cancer. But Davis says there are other issues that can happen from being in the sun that you might not know about.

“The sun is an immune system stimulant,” she says. “It is technically toxic to the skin and irritates the skin.”

It can trigger what’s called polymorphic light eruption, which can cause a nasty rash. It’s like an allergic reaction. Also, sun can interact with stuff on your skin, such as perfume or spilled citrus juice, and cause what looks like a burn or sting.

“Phytophotodermatitis, which is a chemical toxic reaction to the skin, gives your skin a chemical burn,” she says.

Ouch. So, be careful, because the sun can cause more trouble than just sunburn.

Davis says in addition to polymorphic light eruption and phytophotodermatitis, two other conditions may arise from sun exposure. They are solar urticaria, or hives, which is a rare condition that causes you to become allergic to ultraviolet light (most common for adults with lifelong high UV exposure, such as airline pilots or professional mountain climbers), and porphyria, which is a blood condition that is exacerbated by UV light, and often under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed.",26/07/2017
NewsDay,NYSAC improving in MMA regulation's first year,"Gian Villante discussed two very different sets of hiccups ahead of his fight at the UFC’s Long Island debut on Saturday.

First up, those irritating ones he was unable to shake in the days leading into his last two fights.

The second set, however, belonged to the New York State Athletic Commission, which is in its first year regulating mixed martial arts.

“It’s difficult, they do some things differently, but they’re new at this, so you can’t blame them for having their hiccups in the beginning,” Villante said. “They’re going to have their hiccups in the beginning and stuff like that but they’re still early on.”

NYSAC has made its share of mistakes in these initial months, most notably Daniel Cormier’s towel on the scale trick and the confusion over replay, referees and what’s a legal strike in the Chris Weidman vs. Gegard Mousasi fight. But, with each event, things seem to be improving.

New York became the final place in North America to remove its ban on MMA when the State Assembly passed the bill in March 2016. A month later, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the bill at a Madison Square Garden ceremony. In November, the UFC hosted its first New York show at MSG, setting attendance and live gate records for the venue and promotion.

NYSAC has overseen no less than seven major professional MMA events in total, and UFC on Fox 25 last Saturday at Nassau Coliseum went off without incident. It was the fifth trip to New York for the UFC, and regardless of previous missteps, the promotion has no qualms about continuing to bring events here.

“Yeah, there’s little things with the commission, whether we just need to coordinate it all, but each show has gotten easier and easier and they’re running fine,” said Marc Ratner, UFC vice president of regulatory affairs. “I’m very, very pleased with it.”

In the beginning

As weigh-ins and medical checks for the UFC’s first show on Long Island wrapped up Friday morning, Ratner sounded comfortable with how the state has embraced the sport in the first year.

“There was a pent-up awareness and people wanted to see it,” said Ratner, who led the charge for MMA legalization. “It took us eight years to get OKd here. We can tell from the television ratings, the number of pay-per-view buys, this is a great area for us to promote in. When we finally got here, we had the biggest show we’ve ever had here.”

In an email ahead of Saturday’s event, NYSAC spokesman Laz Benitez said the response to legal MMA in the state has been positive.

“Fighters want to fight in New York, the world’s biggest stage,” Benitez wrote. “As for promoters and fans, the State has already hosted six at-or-near capacity cards, so the demand is there and the reaction has been tremendous.”

As positive as the numbers and responses have been, all sides acknowledge the unique challenge of building a new operation.

“The biggest inherent challenge was indeed just that, starting a new product from scratch, although our experience with boxing was helpful,” Benitez said. “The Commission began from the ground floor to develop a game plan that would be fully executable once the sport was legalized.” Ratner believes any issues are part of a learning curve and that even the little things take time to pick up.

“First of all, we’re doing an early morning weigh-in, this is different,” Ratner said. “We’ve got to see if they’re going to use a digital scale, if they’re going to use what we call a meat scale. Doctors, how long’s it going to take to do every medical. Little small things, nothing extraordinary.”

UFC 205 at Madison Square Garden broke promotional and arena gate records as Conor McGregor won his second UFC title against Eddie Alvarez in the main event. That card on Nov. 12, 2016, was monumental for many reasons. But it also highlighted issues a new set of regulators can face.

“Fighter safety and the integrity of combative sports in New York State are our top priorities,” Benitez said. “And after exhaustive work, preparation and consultation with a multitude of industry experts, the commission put together a framework in time for the sport’s debut last November at Madison Square Garden that achieved those goals.”

The commission’s work resulted in a set of regulations unique to the state, causing some confusion at the start. Under New York’s rules, fighters who don’t make weight still must be within a certain range for the fight to be held. This rule was partially responsible for the cancellation of a bout between Kelvin Gastelum and Donald Cerrone last November. It also forced Jim Miller to come in above 156 pounds for his lightweight bout after opponent Thiago Alves missed the limit by more than six pounds.

When the UFC visited Albany last December, Ratner said a miscommunication left the fighters without a doctor on site who could perform stitches, a typical fixture at UFC events.

“We pride ourselves in having one of the doctors stitch and in Albany, we couldn’t get a doctor to stitch there, we had to have [fighters] wait in the hospital,” Ratner said. “It’s a big convenience for the fighters to not have to wait in the hospital. We always ask for one New York licensed doctor who can stitch. We pay for all that stuff, there was just a miscommunication and we couldn’t get the person there on time.”

Following February’s UFC 208 at Barclays Center, Holly Holm filed and lost an appeal after referee Todd Anderson did not penalize Germaine de Randamie for strikes Holm deemed to be thrown after the round ended. There also was scrutiny of the judging in de Randamie’s win, as well as Anderson Silva’s win over Derek Brunson.

But at UFC 210 in Buffalo last April, the miscues reached their pinnacle. The event nearly lost a fighter over the state’s rule banning female boxers with breast implants from competing. NYSAC reviewed Pearl Gonzalez’s medical records and cleared her to fight that afternoon.

More notably, it was the site of Cormier’s infamous towel grab. After first weighing in at 206.2 pounds — over the 205-pound limit for a light heavyweight championship fight — Cormier weighed in again a couple minutes later. That is allowed under NYSAC guidelines for a championship fight, but not a non-title fight, a fact expressly stated in a boxing guidelines memorandum but not spelled out in the state’s MMA guidelines posted on their website.

A couple minutes later, Cormier put his hands on the towel covering his naked body from view while weighing in for the second time. He was 205 pounds.

“We learned that if you’re going to have a towel around a fighter to make sure that he doesn’t have his hands on it,” Ratner said. “That may have happened before, but this was pretty crazy that it did happen. And sadly, it was tough on the commission.”

In a meeting five days after UFC 210, NYSAC amended language in its guidelines to state a fighter “shall not make physical contact with any person or object other than the scale.”

UFC 210 also put Long Island’s Weidman at the center of controversy. Weidman’s fight was paused after he took two knees to the head from Mousasi originally deemed illegal by referee Dan Miragliotta. But after the use of video review, the strikes were deemed legal and Weidman was ruled unable to continue by doctors. Weidman was handed a TKO loss.

Weidman and others were under the impression replay wasn’t allowed in New York, but it wasn’t strictly banned. NYSAC officials later said the use of replay was justified.

“There was a question of did they have replay or don’t they have replay in the Weidman fight,” Ratner said. “The commission told me they didn’t, then they said they did afterwards.”

Weidman appealed the decision, which was denied in the weeks ahead of UFC Long Island.

Benitez did not comment on specific incidents, but said the NYSAC is learning from each event it oversees.

“As with every new venture and opportunity, there have certainly been instances that the commission has learned and grown from,” Benitez said. “The commission also tapped into an existing pool of established referees, judges and inspectors with MMA experience, making the transition more seamless.”

Improving with time

NYSAC took a publicity hit for these incidents, but there have been some notable improvements, especially at weigh-ins. At Bellator NYC’s weigh-ins in June, Sergio Da Silva repeatedly tried to shift his balance and fool the scale to come in on weight. Three different NYSAC officials told Da Silva to stop the antics, step off the scale and start again.

The commission also was quick to stop Eryk Anders from touching the towel during his weigh-in for UFC Long Island last week.

For the most part, fighters appear understanding of the learning curve.

Villante, who fought in Albany last December, thinks the commission would be smart to seek guidance from New Jersey, the first state to adopt unified rules for the sport back in 2001.

“If they can learn a little bit from (New Jersey State Athletic and Control Board counsel) Nick Lembo over in Jersey, I think that’s one of the finest-run commissions. If they can learn a little bit from those guys, maybe, the next state over, I think that’d be a great thing,” Villante said. “But they’re learning on the fly, which is tough to do, but they’re getting it and I think, in time, it’ll get better and better.”

Benitez said NYSAC consulted numerous commissions in drafting their plan and remains in contact with other states as well as the Association of Boxing Commissions.

Patrick Cummins fought in New York for the second time on Saturday, defeating Villante by split decision. The Pennsylvania native was on the Buffalo card but had no issues getting ready to fight.

“I felt good with the commission. I know there were a lot of problems, especially during that Buffalo card,” Cummins said. “But, me? It didn’t affect me much, so, I don’t know. I don’t know whether to be thankful or to say that, yeah New York’s doing a great job.”

Darren Elkins, who defeated Dennis Bermudez in Saturday’s co-main event, said he understands what New York is going through after fighting in the early days of legal MMA near his hometown.

“I’m back in the day when there was no commission where I came from in Indiana, Chicago and that area. When we first got the commission, they had a lot of snags and they had a lot of things going on, too,” Elkins said. “It’s just working out the kinks, that’s what they’ve gotta do. When they figure that out, it’ll go all smooth. We’re so used to these commissions that have been around for a long time that we’re just not used to seeing something this new.”

The insurance issue

Still, the newness of it all has caused some fighters to pause. New Jersey’s Jim Miller fought in New York twice. Those will be his last fights here, he said.

“I think they’re just trying to reinvent the wheel,” Miller told BJPenn.com Radio in April. “It’s not that they’re doing things that are unsafe or anything like that. They’re trying to take really good care of the fighters. But they’re kind of being really overbearing with it, and a lot of these rules you don’t hear about.”

NYSAC requires additional neurological and blood examinations ahead of fights compared with other commissions such as New Jersey.

Ratner doesn’t see anything wrong with adding new protections, but he does hope to see commissions come up with a universal rule set to help ease confusion here and elsewhere.

“One of the problems, whether it be boxing or MMA, and I’ve been advocating this for 25 years or more, we don’t have standardized medical testing or standardized rules in every state,” Ratner said. “Now we don’t even have unified fight rules, but standardized medicals are extremely important. And I’m a states-rights guy, but we should be able to have the same blood tests, licensure, same hepatitis, HIV, same kind of stuff about MRIs, license calendar year. And every state is a little bit different, and there’s no reason for that.”

Ratner also noted that each show NYSAC oversees is high-visibility due to a $1 million life-threatening traumatic brain injury insurance requirement set by the state legislature, leaving few learning opportunities on smaller stages.

“They don’t have small fights. Every fight is a big fight, whether it’s us or it’s boxing,” Ratner said. “I know that the commission is working on the rules now to make it better insurance-wise. Whether they can do that or not, I don’t know. But what you want is small fights, too, to work on things.”

Benitez said the commission is continually assessing all policies and procedures, but any change to the insurance requirement would need to be approved and passed by the state legislature.

“This is unique coverage in the combative sports world,” Benitez said.

Fight on

New York may be among the strictest states, but Ratner has not yet heard of fighters turning down fights here.

“I’ve had fighters tell me they don’t want to fight in certain places like in Mexico because of the altitude or something like that, but no, it’s fine here,” Ratner said.

Benitez said the state also is not aware of any licensees shying from New York because of medical guidelines.

For some fighters, thinking about where they compete goes against their fighting mentality.

“I never think twice about taking a fight. As soon as something’s offered, I take it, that’s my style,” Cummins said. “I feel like just because it’s so new to New York, it’s going to be tough, but I’m hoping they have things figured out now. No towel blunders this time around.” Elkins said he leaves it to the people who sign his check to make those decisions.

“Honestly, I’ve seen some of the things that are going on there, but all you can do is move forward,” Elkins said. “When they ask you to fight somewhere, it’s work, man. It’s either that you work or you don’t work, and I like to work and I like to compete. So, I took it. Is there concern? A little bit, but hopefully I keep things in my own hands and I don’t have to worry about anything.”

Bermudez believes fighters who do things the right way should have nothing to worry about.

“Everything I do, I just show up and do me,” Bermudez said. “I’m not a panicky, worrying kind of guy,” Bermudez said. “I don’t cheat the system in any way, shape or form so I have nothing to be concerned with.”

Gastelum was back in New York for a main event after his weight issues and NYSAC rules forced him off UFC 205 at the Garden.

“There was a little bit of hesitation, but at the same time, this was an amazing opportunity that I couldn’t pass up,” Gastelum said.

Even Weidman, Long Island’s biggest star who defeated Gastelum in Saturday’s main event, had people close to him telling him to avoid fighting in his home state. But, fighting at Nassau Coliseum was too much to pass up.

“Definitely a little hesitation, more hesitation with, like, my team, the people around me who care about me, they don’t like the way the New York commission dealt with a lot of stuff,” Weidman said. “Behind the scenes, with me, with the way the fight went down, with that and other things. There were some people that were like, ‘You’re not fighting, I don’t care, you’re not fighting in New York.’

“And I just did it.”",24/07/2017
NewsDay,EOC of Suffolk still meeting diverse needs after 50 years,"Guns and gangs, AIDS and access — the Economic Opportunity Council of Suffolk has faced it all, providing assistance and education to those in need for the past 50 years and adapting to changing times.

The agency opened its doors on May 5, 1967, in Amityville and now works out of Patchogue. In September, the council will celebrate its golden anniversary with a gala celebration.

“We started as safety net,” said Adrian Fassett, who has been president of the Economic Opportunity Council since 1992. “Then we realized that we were seeing the same people each year. Then we would see their kids and their kids, so we changed the model to a more self-sufficiency model.”

Its mission is to help low-income families and individuals by providing education and economic opportunities.

Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri, who has worked with Fassett for several years, including with youth programs, called the council an asset to the “economically diverse community.”

“They do things quietly, in the right way,” Pontieri said.

Manuel Roias, 45, of Riverhead, who participated in the agency’s Family Planning and Development Program, said he had been incarcerated and struggled with addiction before program coordinator Jose Veliz and worker Michele Martin-Lucas helped him reconnect with his daughter and find housing. They also provided transportation for medical appointments.

“They were there every step of the way,” Roias said. “They were there to be a voice of reason and gave me smart three-month, six-month goals. They introduced me to that and I owe thanks to them.”

Delores Quintyne, 83, of Amityville, who worked with the council as an advocate starting in the late 1960s, recalled the organization’s challenges. Financial struggles in the 1980s led to a dwindling staff.

“We were doing two jobs instead of one, sometimes three,” Quintyne said of the remaining staff. “But we maintained and kept going.”

The agency now has 196 employees and has assisted 20,000 people this year, Fassett said.

Funding for the Economic Opportunity Council comes from Federal Community Services Block Grants, according to the agency’s website. The agency also receives funding from the towns of Islip and Babylon, the state Department of Health, United Way and other organizations.

Fassett said that in the 1990s, the agency shifted its focus to help people and families affected by HIV/AIDS, which led to the creation of the Targeted Prevention and Supportive Service Program to provide patients with referrals for testing and transportation, and offer education and awareness training to the public.

Now, with gun violence becoming a broad community concern, the council started the SNUG Violence Prevention Program. SNUG — GUNS spelled backward — is an initiative to reduce and prevent shootings and gang violence.

“We have been quite successful,” said project coordinator Debra Sterling. “SNUG is successful because of credible messengers who may have been incarcerated, and they have turned their lives around for the better and people really pay attention to that.”",24/07/2017

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics’ rapid Zika test approved in Brazil,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has won regulatory approval to sell its rapid test for Zika and a companion results reader in Brazil, the country hit hardest by the mosquito-borne virus, executives said.

The Medford-based maker of point-of-care tests for HIV, syphilis and tropical diseases said last week its results reader has been approved for commercial sale by the Brazilian health regulator Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria.

The agency earlier approved the Zika test for sale. The test and results reader also were successfully evaluated by Brazil’s National Institute for Quality Control in Health.

Sharon Klugewicz, Chembio’s acting CEO, said, “We can now shift our focus to commercial activities.”

Brazil is the epicenter of the Zika virus, which causes the birth defect microcephaly where infants have smaller-than-normal heads. More than 2,300 cases have been confirmed in the South American country, and over 3,000 cases are being investigated.

Since 2015, there have been Zika outbreaks in more than 80 countries, including the United States. The virus takes its name from the Ugandan forest where it was first identified in 1947.

Chembio developed its testing system with Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the Brazilian-government agency responsible for producing tests, vaccines and drugs for use by the public health system.",10/07/2017
NewsDay,"Mites plague bee colonies, state’s agricultural production","A plague of parasitic mites is exterminating New York bee colonies, threatening $500 million in losses from the state’s annual agricultural production that relies on bee pollination and honey production.

Commercially operated bee colonies in upstate New York have sustained up to 70 percent population loss over the past several years due to pesticides, loss of habitat and disease, according to state officials.

But the varroa mite has recently emerged as one of the leading causes of colony death in New York, and has infested 90 percent of the colonies surveyed in the past year, said Emma Mullen, a research scientist at Cornell University. Mullen is the senior lead of the New York State Beekeeper Tech Team, a group of scientists working with state officials to protect honeybees and other species of animals that pollinate crops.

“A lot of the operations that we visited — 78 percent of them — had levels that are critical for honeybee health,” Mullen said. “It poses a risk to the colony dying.”

Varroa mites weaken honeybee colonies by feeding off the bees in a manner similar to a mosquito. Deadly viruses are transmitted to the colony in the process, which can cascade into an extermination of the colony, according to Mullen’s report.

Her team was formed just over a year ago with $150,000 in state funding and is led by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. The Department of Environmental Conservation also collaborates in the state initiative to protect pollinator species.

“The conundrum here is that everyone here realizes that it’s significant, we all need pollination,” said Richard Ball, commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Markets. “But when we gathered to do the Pollinator Protection Plan, we began to realize there were huge gaps in the actual understanding, other than it’s a big deal.”

Ball said state officials were surprised to find out just how much of a threat the varroa mite was when Mullen’s team published its findings. Only 36 percent of beekeepers were independently monitoring their colonies for the parasite in 2016, according to Mullen’s report.

Beekeepers on Long Island are hobbyists. Some have established relationships with local farms, providing farmers with pollination for their crops while allowing the bees to collect forage to produce honey. Donal Peterson is among those who closely monitor their hives for varroa. He is vice president of the Long Island Beekeepers Club and manages 100 bee colonies across Long Island, with about 4 million bees between them all.

“Every one of them have varroa to some level, but it’s manageable,” Peterson, of Bay Shore, said recently as he collected honey from a hive at Restoration Farm in Old Bethpage. “Other beekeepers tell me that they don’t have varroa mites in their colonies. I just don’t think that they know how to look for them.”

It’s difficult to prevent varroa mites from infesting a colony in the first place, Peterson said, because it requires that other nearby colonies stay healthy. When one colony gets sick and dies, other nearby colonies will attack to steal their honey, which causes the mites to spread even further.

“I’ve tried it myself as a hobbyist, thinking that I could be a very hands-off beekeeper,” said Caroline Fanning, co-founder of the Restoration Farm that hosts one of Peterson’s bee hives. “It didn’t work out that way. I had high incidences of varroa. That’s why we have Don coming in to take care of the hives.”

Because the infestation is so common, beekeepers have to focus on keeping the varroa manageable, rather than preventing infestations, Peterson said. A level of varroa mites greater than 3 for every 100 bees is unsustainable to the colony, according to Mullen’s report.

“By themselves, they may not be such a problem, but when you start adding in all these other viruses . . . lack of forage . . . pesticides,” Peterson said. “People like to look for the magic bullet that’s going to solve all these issues with bees. I think what we’re seeing is a scenario of ‘death by a thousand cuts.’ ”

Ball said that with all those variable threats to bee colonies, it’s difficult to focus the department’s resources in combating pollinator population decline. DEC officials added that there is not enough information available to know which direction to take in drafting policy.

“I think we need a little more research,” Ball said. “[Varroa] is a very significant player, more than we previously understood . . . so let’s dial that in a little closer and see if there are additional management practices that we can put in place.”",09/07/2017
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics plans to sell $21.2M in stock,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. plans to sell more stock to raise up to $21.2 million to fund acquisitions, factory improvements and other activities, executives said Tuesday.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, Ebola, Zika and other diseases has established an “at-the-market” program with the Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. brokerage in Manhattan.

The program involves the sale of Chembio shares at the market price with the timing of the sale decided by the company, the officials said.

No shares have yet been sold under the program; up to 3.3 million shares will be sold over time, according to a securities filing.

The program “is an important tool that will be used in a disciplined manner to support growth opportunities, specifically including acquisitions and investments in manufacturing operations, and other corporate purchases,” acting CEO Sharon Klugewicz said in a statement.

A voicemail message seeking further comment wasn’t immediately returned Tuesday night.

The planned sale comes less than a year after Chembio raised $12.8 million by selling 2.3 million shares priced at $6. The proceeds from that sale are being used to pay for test development, clinical trials, marketing and other activities, executives said in August 2016.

After completion of the stock sale announced Tuesday, the company would have 15.6 million outstanding shares, according to the securities filing.

The announcement came after the stock market closed on Tuesday. Chembio shares were unchanged at $6.35 in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They are down 25 percent in the past 12 months.

The company reported a loss of $13.4 million last year on sales of $17.9 million.

NewsDay,'Pharma Bro' defies advice to keep quiet before fraud trial,"""Pharma Bro"" just won't keep his mouth shut.

Even before his federal securities fraud trial began Monday, Martin Shkreli blatantly defied his attorneys' advice to lay low. The former pharmaceutical CEO, who became a pariah after raising the cost of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent, has been preening for cameras and trolling on social media, potentially complicating his defense.

""I'm excited,"" Shkreli said of the trial in a brief phone call last week to The Associated Press. ""I can't wait.""

Jury selection got underway Monday, and opening statements could occur as early as Tuesday.

Since his high-profile arrest in late 2015 when he was led into court in a gray hoodie, Shkreli has been free on bail and free to speak his mind. He went on Twitter to label members of Congress ""imbeciles"" for demanding to know why his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of Daraprim, a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis and HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill.

He took to YouTube for a series of lessons on chemistry and stock market analysis. His Twitter posts mocking a freelance journalist turned so creepy — one showed a fake photo of him canoodling with her — that his account was shut down. And on Facebook, he mused about the possibility of being ""unjustly imprisoned.""

Legal experts say there are obvious reasons lawyers want clients facing serious criminal charges to keep quiet.

""It's twofold: You don't want to antagonize the judge and you don't want to get the attention of the jury in a way that hurts your case,"" said veteran New York City defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt.

Columbia law professor John Coffee compared the situation to President Donald Trump's unruly tweeting habits. ""A lawyer can caution him,"" he said. ""But just like Trump, he doesn't have to listen.""

Though Shkreli's notoriety came from Daraprim, the federal securities fraud case is unrelated. Prosecutors say that after Shkreli lost millions of dollars through bad trades through his side business hedge fund, he looted a second pharmaceutical company for $11 million to pay them back. The defense has argued that he had good intentions.

""Everybody got paid back in this case,"" his lawyer said. ""Whatever else he did wrong, he ultimately made them whole.""

The defense has floated the possibility that it would put Shkreli on the witness stand to try to highlight how he grew up in a working-class Albanian family in Brooklyn, taught himself chemistry, interned at a financial firm founded by CNBC's Jim Cramer and struck out on his own to become a rising star in biotechnology startups. He wanted to develop new life-saving drugs after seeing ""several classmates and other children he knew struck down by debilitating disease,"" court papers say.

Prosecutors call it a ploy to portray the boyish-looking Shkreli as ""a Horatio Alger-like figure who, through hard work and intelligence, is in a position to do great things if only the jury would ignore the evidence and base its verdict on sympathy."" The real Shkreli was a con man often undone by his own mouth, they say.

The government has cited claims by one of Shkreli's former employees that Shkreli harassed his family in a dispute over shares of stock.

""I hope to see you and your four children homeless and will do whatever I can to assure this,"" Shkreli wrote the employee's wife, according to court filings.

Prosecutors also used his boasts about some of his purchases of eccentric collectibles to undermine efforts to reduce his bail from $5 million to $2 million. If he needed to raise cash to pay legal fees and back taxes, they argued, why not sell the one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album that he brought for $2 million or his Nazi-era Engima code-breaking machine?

Also cited were his offers to pay a $100,000 bounty for finding the killer of a Democratic National Committee staffer and $40,000 in tuition for a Princeton student who solved a math problem he posed during a guest lecture at the school earlier this year.

Shkreli ""is not the demon he's been made out to be,"" the student, Yuan Wang, told the AP.

'Pharma Bro' defies advice to keep quiet before fraud trial

NewsDay,"Ketumile Masire, former Botswana president, dies at 91","Ketumile Masire, a cattle herder turned statesman who, as president of Botswana from 1980 to 1998, helped solidify his country’s standing as one of the most richly thriving nations in Africa, died Thursday at a hospital in the capital city of Gaborone. He was 91.

Masire died “peacefully” and surrounded by family members at a hospital in Gaborone, the capital, Masire’s family said in a statement. He had been critically ill.

Masire was widely heralded as a model leader in a model nation on a continent where poverty, corruption and violence had crushed many hopes for stability and prosperity.

“We have seen the promise of a new Africa whose roots are deep here in your soil, for you have been an inspiration to all who cherish freedom,” President Bill Clinton declared to Masire on a visit in 1998.

Clinton noted that in 1966 when Botswana — then known as Bechuanaland — obtained independence from Britain, it had two miles of paved roads and a single public high school. Its chief export was beef.

The discovery of diamond reserves transformed the country’s prospects, and under Masire and his predecessor, Seretse Khama, the nation used its revenue to build roads and schools, to improve health care and expand access to clean water, to advance farming techniques and to extend life spans.

Khama, the first president of independent Botswana, was featured in last year’s film “A United Kingdom.”

Masire was credited with leading his landlocked nation through a drought in much of the 1980s. In 1989, he shared the $100,000 Africa Prize for Leadership from the charity the Hunger Project in recognition of the food distribution that helped the country avoid starvation.

He navigated a delicate relationship with South Africa, Botswana’s major economic partner to the south. Botswana opposed apartheid.

While many other African nations suffered under dictatorship, Botswana featured a robust democracy with little if any noticeable corruption. The stability allowed tourism to flourish, with many visitors coming to witness its wildlife.

The country of 2 million people nevertheless faces poverty, a high HIV/AIDS rate and other problems.

Masire was born in southern Botswana on July 23, 1925. In his youth, he was a herder before enrolling in a primary school at 13, according to a statement from the government announcing his death.

He also worked as a journalist, which along with his community involvement helped draw him into politics. Before becoming president, Masire had served in roles including minister of finance and development planning and vice president.

After leaving office, he advised other African leaders and chaired an international panel that probed the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

In his retirement, Masire established the Sir Ketumile Masire Foundation, a nongovernmental organization that seeks to improve agriculture, governance and children’s health in the region.

“We have a saying in Botswana: A man is never strong until he says what he believes and gives other men the chance to do the same,” he once told The Washington Post. “I am proud to say without a doubt . . . we are a strong democracy.”

NewsDay,Lili Taylor turns to the stage in ‘Marvin’s Room’,"Unlike other actors, who never lose their star persona, Lili Taylor has that unerring ability to become the character she’s playing, so much so that you forget you’re watching her and just see a frustrated waitress (her breakout role in “Mystic Pizza”), a homicidal groupie (“I Shot Andy Warhol”) or a long-suffering single woman caring for her ailing father in “Marvin’s Room,” a revival of Scott McPherson’s touching family drama, which opens June 29 at the American Airlines Theatre.

The tale concerns two sisters — Dad’s faithful caregiver, Bessie (Taylor), and prodigal misfit Lee (Janeane Garofalo), who returns home after many years when Bessie suddenly finds herself the patient needing care. (Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep starred in the 1997 film version.)

Taylor, 50, recently earned an Emmy nomination for her work in “American Crime.” She is married to poet Nick Flynn, and they have a daughter, Maeve.

In the play, we see Bessie about to give blood, talking about how she’s not good with shots and needles. How is Lili with that sort of thing?

I’m OK, thank God. [She laughs.] So it’s not hard to do the scene. Although the way the doctor is flailing that needle around could make anybody nervous.

The play is funny, but it’s spot-on when dealing with the odd reality of health care.

The playwright had HIV when he was writing this. Later when he was dying, he was happy about how right he’d gotten it. He really captures that tension, the absurdity and gravity of it all.

How’d you get involved in this production?

The director, Annie Kauffman asked if I would do it. The summer isn’t the best time to do a show, what with having a kid, and summer camp. It’s strange for me to be here in New York . . . home . . . but not with her. I’m always trying to get [jobs here] so I can be with her, and once I get a job in town . . . she’s away. So, c’est la vie, it is what it is. She’ll come back, and then I’ll have to go away for a job. But that’s what it is. She knows I’m a gypsy.

Was this play on your bucket list?

No. I’d never considered it. But it grabbed me. It has this special quality — it’s his only play, he died young. For me, it has this need-to-get-out kind of thing.

One thing that’s unique about it is Marvin, your bedridden father . . . and his room. We see the doorway, we see you go in and out, we hear you talking to him, but we never see him or the room. What do you do in there?

We treat it like a real room. There aren’t props, but I pretend to move around, I flip his pillow — that’s real. As our director said, if we’re not moving, you can feel that we’re just sitting there like lumps. You can feel a deadness in the room. But if there’s just a little movement and an intention to the movement, it solves the problem.

As for upcoming movies — I hear you shot “Leatherface,” about the infamous villain from “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.”

I play the mama — the big bad mama. That’s my boy.

Your parenting is clearly a little wanting.

It really is. It’s not good. [She laughs.]

But it sounds like you had fun.

We did. We really did.

One last thing — I hear you’re a big-time birder.

I am. I’m on the board of the National Audubon Society, and the American Bird Association. I’m involved, talking about legislation.

What birds do you like?

Common stuff. What’s right around us. I’m not into finding exotic birds. I’m into more, “Oh, did you see that interesting sparrow over there?” That’s exaggerating, because sparrows bother me. But there’s so much wildlife in the city. I can go anywhere in the world and see birds. They’re great. Birds can open you up to interest in trees, insects, climate — everything. It’s a gateway drug. [She laughs again.]

Why do sparrows bug you?

They’ll kill other birds for their nest. They kill everything around. I have a house upstate — and bluebird boxes. Now bluebirds are having trouble, and I’m trying to help. But a sparrow kept killing the bluebirds, their babies. I finally had my neighbor shoot the sparrow — it was a whole Greek drama.

You don’t mess around.

No, nature’s rough, and I’m part of it, too. So I’ll kill the damn sparrow. Legally you can — they’re an invasive species. So it’s OK.

I’ve interviewed birders. You’re an unusual breed.

We are. My husband’s a poet. He says, “I found the tribe that’s a little bit odder than poets.”",19/06/2017
NewsDay,Court of Appeals hears arguments on physician-assisted suicide,"ALBANY — Judges on New York’s top court voiced skepticism Tuesday about establishing a right to physician-assisted suicide while questioning how the state can ban that but allow a person to refuse medical treatment.

In oral arguments before the Court of Appeals, an advocacy group, “End of Life Choice New York,” along with some terminally ill patients and physicians asked the judges to view “aid in dying,” as the groups call it, as different from “suicide.” They say lower courts — which have ruled against them — have erred in applying a “dictionary definition of suicide” and upholding a century-old New York law against assisted suicide.

Judges’ questions during oral arguments aren’t always an indication of how they will rule ultimately. However, time and again several judges cited a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld New York’s ban, saying it didn’t violate federal equal protection or due process rights. When Edwin Schallert, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the case was about “autonomy, liberty and free choices,” Court of Appeals judges cast doubt.

“Those arguments have been rejected by the Supreme Court,” Judge Michael Garcia said. “I’m having some trouble seeing the state constitutional road to the end you are seeking.”

Schallert contended the 1997 case, Quill v. Vacco, wasn’t “controlling” in determining the outcome of the lawsuit against the state. That prompted Judge Eugene Fahey to say: “You’ve really got to show me where in New York jurisprudence there is a basis for what you are saying.”

But the attorney for the state was challenged, too, at times during the roughly 30-minute proceeding. Specifically, Judge Jenny Rivera repeatedly burrowed in about how the state can allow “terminal sedation” — that is, allowing a terminally ill person to refuse treatment meant to prevent death while accepting medication to ease pain — but outlaw assisted suicide.

“I find the state’s argument extremely compelling until we get to terminal sedation,” Rivera told deputy solicitor general Anisha Dasgupta. What is the state’s interest in outlawing one action when, in the end, a terminally ill person will die anyway, Rivera asked.

Dasgupta said there was a distinction between the two, that there was no “constitutional right” to suicide and that “this court would have to create it out of whole cloth” to upend the state ban.

In contrast to Rivera, Judge Leslie Stein wondered: “Haven’t we made a clear distinction between refusing treatment and aiding or assisting suicide?”

The lawsuit was filed by a coalition in 2015 led by three patients with terminal diagnoses. Steve Goldenberg, who has since died of HIV-related illness; Sara Myers, who has since died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, and Eric Sieff, who is still being treated for cancer.",30/05/2017
NewsDay,NY’s highest court to weigh physician-assisted suicide lawsuit,"ALBANY — New York’s highest court will hear arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit that seeks to effectively undo the state’s statute against physician-assisted suicide.

An advocacy group, “End of Life Choice New York,” along with some terminally ill patients, and physicians, lawyers and the New York Civil Liberties Union, will ask the Court of Appeals to view “aid in dying,” as the groups call it, as different from “suicide.” They say lower courts — which have ruled against them — have erred in applying a “dictionary definition of suicide.”

The advocates are pressing the lawsuit at the same time they are intensely lobbying state legislators to change the law this year to allow physician-assisted suicide.

On the other side, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman’s office will defend state law that makes “promoting a suicide attempt” — defined in part as intentionally causing or aiding another person to attempt suicide — a felony. The New York State Catholic Conference and “Not Dead Yet,” a group of disability activists, are among those that have filed legal briefs in the case supporting the current state ban.

Two lower courts have upheld the state law. The courts said that the “straightforward meaning” of the word “suicide” applies to “aid in dying.”

“Whatever label one puts on the act that plaintiffs are asking us to permit, it unquestionably fits that literal description, since there is a direct causative link between the medication proposed to be administered by plaintiff physicians and their patients’ demise,” the Appellate Division, New York’s midlevel appeals court ruled.

The lawsuit was filed by a coalition in 2015 led by three patients with terminal diagnoses. Steve Goldenberg, who has since died of HIV-related illness; Sara Myers, who has since died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease; and Eric Sieff, who is being treated for cancer.

The group also includes three doctors who were the plaintiffs in a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court case that unsuccessfully challenged New York’s ban. The nation’s top court ruled the prohibition didn’t violate federal equal protection or due process rights. Six states have approved physician-assisted suicide, including neighboring Vermont.

Proponents use the phrase “aid in dying” and say that it is different from suicide, which they view as “cutting short a life of uncertain duration.”

“This is a case about mentally competent, terminally-ill New Yorkers. They are not making a choice between continuing to live or die,” Kathryn Tucker, executive director of End of Life Choices, New York, said in an interview. “It’s really a privacy-liberty-autonomy argument first.”

The Catholic Conference calls the attempt by advocates to reframe the debate “verbal engineering.” In briefs submitted to the court, the conference said the state law couldn’t be any clearer in outlawing the act of “intentionally . . . aids another person to commit suicide.” Further, it noted that advocates’ definition of “aid in dying” underscores that “the physician is directly in the line of causation that brings about a patient’s death.”

Not Dead Yet contends, among other arguments, that terminal prognoses for patients can be mistaken and that overturning the ban could erode “long-standing protections of old, ill and disabled people.”

The case will be argued before a shorthanded Court of Appeals, which will have just five judges hearing the case. Chief Judge Janet DiFiore must recuse herself because the original lawsuit, besides naming the state, named her in her former capacity as Westchester County district attorney (along with four other prosecutors). Further, the court has one vacancy following the April death of Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam.",28/05/2017
NewsDay,Give more attention to Lyme disease,"Give more attention to Lyme disease

Lyme disease is becoming more widespread, with an estimated 300,000 new cases a year in the United States. This makes it more prevalent than breast cancer or HIV.

However, Lyme disease receives less attention and significantly less funding than these other diseases. Why do so many people suffer for years with Lyme before receiving a proper diagnosis? Why do doctors fail to inform patients that a negative test result does not necessarily rule out Lyme disease?

Despite popular belief, not everyone infected with Lyme will present with the telltale bullseye rash or even recall a tick bite. The standard tests are unreliable. This leaves many Lyme patients undiagnosed, untreated and at risk of developing a complex, chronic illness that is much more difficult to treat than an early infection. Symptoms may include flu-like illness, fever, headache and extreme fatigue.

It’s hard to find doctors who treat chronic Lyme, and many don’t take insurance.

This is a terrible injustice. We need more than just talk about prevention; we need better training for doctors, more accurate testing and updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.

Camp counselors learn valuable work lessons

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

I’m always surprised when I speak with parents of high school- and college-aged young adults about the opportunities they hope their children will secure for the summer. Many would like their children to get internships or office jobs to help them succeed in future employment.

Any future employer who has worked at a summer camp knows that camp counselors also gain important skills that today’s employers seek.

The Partnership for 21st Century Skills, a group of businesses, education leaders and policymakers, found there is a gap in the information students gain in school and the skills they need to succeed. Many of these essential skills are fostered at camp, including oral communication, collaboration, work ethic, creativity, leadership, social skills, problem solving and critical thinking.

Camp counselors experience responsibility by leading children and making sure their needs are met. Counselors also communicate about schedules and programs with the camp directors and peers.

NewsDay,‘Rent’ review: 1990s AIDS play hasn’t lost its meaning,"WHAT “Rent” WHEN | WHERE Through June 3. Upcoming: 2 p.m. Wednesday, 2 and 8 p.m. Thursday and next Wednesday, May 31, 8 p.m. Friday and Tuesday, 3 and 8:30 p.m. Saturday, 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at Gateway Playhouse, 215 South Country Rd., Bellport TICKETS $29.50-$89; 631-286-1133, thegateway.org

“Rent” has come of age. It’s been 21 years since it opened on Broadway in the wake of tragedy and a rush of adrenaline and urgency. I won’t calculate here the number of minutes in 21 years — 21 “Seasons of Love” — other than to note that it would require too many syllables for a comprehensible lyric.

As directed at Gateway Playhouse by Matt Karris, who, with the show’s leading character and narrator, shares a passion for filmmaking, this “Rent” reminds me more than earlier incarnations that the one-word title has double meaning. Sure, the landlord wants his former roommates to pay up or get out. But rent also means tearing things apart, including lives and relationships.

Aside from the poverty of these struggling young artists and misfits in the East Village’s Alphabet City (Brittany Loesch’s ramshackle urban set), AIDS is rending their lives asunder. Angel, a drag-queen percussionist affectionately played by Andres Quintero, is dying of full-blown AIDS. He’s cared for by his partner, Tom Collins (Jared Dixon), an NYU tutor who’s beaten up for his sexuality. Roger and his roommate, Mark, the wannabe filmmaker, are freezing on Christmas Eve in a heretofore rent-free apartment. Played with the gloom of ineffectual denial by Anthony Festa, guitar-playing Roger and his off-and-on girlfriend, Mimi, are both HIV positive at a time when the disease was only marginally treatable. Mimi, a stripper played with ferocious intensity by Michelle Veintimilla, is better at denial, though heroin has left her in worse shape.

Maureen (Natalie Storrs), a bisexual performance artist who dumped Mark to be with Joanne (feisty Moeisha McGill), stages a protest against Benny (Kyle Robert Carter), the landlord who reneges on his rent-free promise. Mark films the happening in hopes of selling it to an alternative news outlet. As the least dysfunctional one in the bunch, Mark is played with an even keel by Jeremy Greenbaum.

But it’s the ladies who steal their scenes — Storrs in Maureen’s defiant “Take Me as I Am” and Veintimilla’s Mimi in “Without You,” sung with Festa. However, the volume distorts the vocals on some higher registers. Andrew Austin’s band sets a torrid pace, though it takes its time on the “Chorus Line”-style delivery of the signature “Seasons of Love,” choreographed by Gerry McIntyre.

Judging by the near-sellout opening-night crowd, “Rent” will pay off as The Gateway’s summer season opener.",23/05/2017

NewsDay,Uber and other ‘Bro Culture’ companies may do poorly by being bad,"What exactly does Uber have to offer that other companies do not? The ride-hailing service doesn’t own its cars or employ drivers. It’s basically a smartphone app that connects passengers to drivers using their own vehicles. Rival apps now do much the same thing.

Uber rightly sees the future as driverless cars that one can summon to one’s doorstep for a ride to work or a coffee. But so do General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Tesla and other auto giants currently snapping up their own ride-hailing services.

Uber does have a uniquely unpleasant CEO, in the person of Travis Kalanick. Also a co-founder, Kalanick had shown himself to be a serial breaker of social and business norms, not to mention laws. He is the face of Silicon Valley’s “bro culture.”

Dan Lyons, chronicler of the phenomenon, describes the bros as good-looking, arrogant, glib and disrespectful to women. They are “jerks,” he says, who, in addition, “don’t know how to run companies.”

Uber’s been sued for using a software tool to trick officials in cities that did not authorize its services. Managerial outings at Uber include trips to escort bars. Female employees have accused managers of groping their breasts. The company’s reputation has become so toxic that a video of Kalanick verbally abusing one of its drivers became news.

So why do capitalists put enormous valuations on companies run with all the social maturity of an unruly frat house? Kalanick’s conduct was so immature that at the age of 40, he promised investors he would “grow up.”

The answer may be that many of the investors are themselves bros. They admire those overly confident rule breakers and share their indifference to ethical concerns. Where others see arrested development, they see disrupters. Where others see repellant behavior, they see tough entrepreneurs.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Because they were hatched from the same amoral culture, the investing bros are blind to the reality that there are limits to anti-social behavior, even on the entrepreneurial frontier. An inability to distinguish between total jerks and tough but savvy managers can end in financial pain.

Why did supposedly sophisticated investors put so much money into Valeant, a company whose business model was to buy essential drugs and then jack up prices to obscene levels? Example: Valeant charged Americans $2,000 a day for a cryptococcal meningitis drug that cost $22 a day in Britain.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s second in command, said about Valeant, “I’m holding my nose.” And other traditional investors have echoed that sentiment.

But hedge funder William Ackman liked Valeant’s style and urged other investors to join in the pillage. Did he think such blatant acts of piracy would go unpunished? The stock cratered, and Ackman lost more than $3 billion of his nearly $4 billion investment.

Recall how 32-year-old Martin Shkreli -- the bro of bros -- shot off a 5,455 percent hike in the price of Daraprim, a 62-year-old HIV drug. A pill once priced at $13.50 later cost $750.

Shkreli liked to be seen playing video games and hanging with rock musicians. Twitter recently suspended his account for posting lies about dating a female journalist. (He Photoshopped pictures of them together.)

The bros are clearly not brimming with social intelligence, a valued skill for corporate managers. The bro culture is already the subject of parodies and TV series. That means its days, at least in the current form, are numbered.

Google’s parent company is currently suing Uber for allegedly stealing its self-driving technology. The Wall Street Journal recently questioned whether Uber can survive competition from the big boys. Really, do you want to place your chips on managers who are promising to grow up?

NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics loss widens on higher costs, expansion","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. reported a wider loss in the January to March period compared with a year earlier because of higher costs for regulatory tests and an expansion into foreign countries.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola and other infectious diseases said it lost $1.6 million in the first quarter that ended March 31. It had lost $303,600 a year earlier.

Sales declined to $6.3 million, a drop of 4.2 percent compared with the same period in 2016.

Still, CEO John Sperzel said Tuesday night that the company was expanding internationally with product sales to Asia, Latin America and Africa.

“We believe the advances made during the first quarter of 2017 demonstrate our commitment to continue building global commercial channels, thereby strengthening our core business in the sexually transmitted disease market, and building a strong position in the high-growth fever and tropical disease market,” he said.

Sperzel also said that by year’s end Chembio would likely fulfill a $5.8 million order from the Brazilian government for HIV tests and test components.

A separate combination test for HIV and syphilis cleared several regulatory hurdles in the first quarter.

The test received a CE mark, which allows Chembio to begin selling it in Europe and most of the Caribbean.

A clinical trial of the HIV/syphilis test in the United States was completed after about a year’s work. But Sperzel said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration “has requested further clinical studies in addition to those recently completed.”

The company also has begun selling a test for Zika and a combination test for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya diseases to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for use in a pilot testing program in Peru, India, Guatemala and Haiti.

The earnings announcement came after the stock market closed Tuesday. Chembio shares closed up 30 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $6.95 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market.",10/05/2017
NewsDay,Marine Le Pen’s defeat is good news for Donald Trump,"The media are framing the defeat of Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election as a defeat for President Donald Trump and his brand of populist nationalism. The Washington Post reported that “France on Sunday shrugged off the siren call of right-wing populism that enchanted voters in the United States and the United Kingdom” and called the election of centrist Emmanuel Macron “a pointed endorsement of European unity.”

No, it wasn’t.

The French vote was not an endorsement of globalism or a vote of confidence in the French political establishment. It was a rejection of Len Pen’s toxic brand of Putinism and anti-Semitism. And the person who should be happiest that Le Pen lost is Trump. She would have been not an ally, but rather, an albatross for the president, because Le Pen was the left wing’s caricature of Trump come to life.

Since Trump’s election, Democrats have tried to paint him as Vladimir Putin’s handpicked president, but in its first months in office the Trump administration has been downright hostile to Russia. Not only did Trump launch missile strikes against Putin’s ally in Syria, Bashar Assad, but also his administration has demanded that Russia leave Ukraine, criticized Putin for reportedly violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, accused Russia of arming the Taliban in Afghanistan and blamed Putin for Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declaring “either Russia has been complicit or has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver” on Syria’s disarmament.

Le Pen would not have given Putin such a cold shoulder. Unlike Trump, she is openly allied with the Russian autocrat. According to the BBC, “In 2014, the National Front took Russian loans worth $12 million. One of the loans, for $9.9 million, came from a small bank, First Czech Russian Bank, with links to the Kremlin.” The loan came at precisely the same time as Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which the BBC notes Le Pen supported, “leading some to question whether the loans were a quid-pro-quo.” Then, just weeks before French voters went to the polls for the election’s first round, Le Pen met with Putin in Moscow, where she reportedly criticized European Union sanctions on Russia as “unfair and silly.” As president, Le Pen would almost have certainly have been the Putin puppet that Trump has not been.

Then there is the cloud of anti-Semitism that hangs over Le Pen’s National Front. At the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum National Days of Remembrance ceremony, Trump delivered a strong denunciation of Holocaust denial, declaring that “there are even those filled with such hate, total hate, that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil.”

One of those “accomplices” is Le Pen’s father, who as leader of the National Front dismissed the gas chambers of the Holocaust as a “detail” of history and declared that the Nazi occupation of France was “not particularly inhuman.” Marine Le Pen called another anti-Semitic remark of his a mere “political gaffe” and distanced the party from her radioactive father in a campaign of what she called “dédiabolisation” (or “un-demonizing”) to bring it into the political mainstream.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But recent reminders of the National Front’s anti-Semitism almost certainly depressed her vote. After winning a spot in the presidential runoff in April, Le Pen handed the reins of the party to Jean-François Jalkh, her handpicked successor, who was then forced to step down days later when it emerged that he had praised a Holocaust denier and declared it was “impossible” for the Nazis to have used Zyklon B gas to kill Jews. Le Pen defended him and called the charges a “defamation.”

And there was also Le Pen’s own “gaffe” when she declared that “I don’t think that France is responsible for the Vél d’Hiv” - the infamous 1942 roundup by French police of 13,000 Paris Jews who were interned in a stadium near the Eiffel Tower before being deported to concentration camps. The arrests were carried out not by Nazi occupiers, but by the French themselves. For Marine Le Pen to deny French complicity in this “detail” of the Holocaust suggests that the apple did not fall far from the tree.

There is a big difference between American-style populism and the virulent strain that exists on the European continent. So it is a mistake to read the French election as a rejection of Trump or his agenda. French voters did not cast their ballots for open borders and global supranationalism - rather, they rejected the National Front with all its racist baggage.

This is why Le Pen’s defeat is good news for Trump. His adversaries at home would have used Le Pen’s ascendance to tarnish him by association. She would have done more damage to his cause in the Élysée Palace than anything Macron might do.

In Le Pen’s defeat, Trump dodged a bullet. Quelle chance!

NewsDay,Medford-based Chembio Diagnostics lands $5.8M contract with Brazil,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has landed a $5.8 million sales order for diagnostic test components and HIV tests for Brazil, executives said Wednesday.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, Ebola and other infectious diseases said it would be supporting the production of HIV tests in Brazil for use by the country’s Ministry of Health for a testing program.

The order was placed by Chembio’s longtime partner in Brazil, Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, the subsidiary of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation that develops and produces vaccines and other treatments for Brazil’s public health system.

Bio-Manguinhos will supply the finished tests, which will carry the Bio-Manguinhos brand name, according to Chembio CEO John Sperzel.

The order is one of Chembio’s largest to date.

In March, the company reported its revenue totaled $18 million last year, including $14 million in product sales.

Sperzel said Wednesday that he couldn’t comment on how many months the order would cover, but “generally such tenders occur annually.”

He also said, “We are pleased to play an important role in [Brazil’s] effort to reduce HIV infection rates and identify patients who will benefit from antiretroviral treatment.”

NewsDay,Our need for science has never been greater,"As young doctors in the 1980s, we witnessed the devastation of the AIDS epidemic. In those years, patients died within months of diagnosis, often in agony. Yet medical science fought back — first identifying the virus, then developing a diagnostic test and treatments. By 1996, effective therapy was available. While much work remains, in particular the development of an HIV vaccine, the response to AIDS stands as a success story in medicine.

At a time when federal funding for medical research faces deep cuts, it’s important to remember a key part of this story — the part that took place well before AIDS was discovered in people. Progress against AIDS did not come from maximizing therapeutic options that were available in 1985. HIV-infected patients did better because of breakthroughs that came in the form of new medicines that grew out of research carried out decades earlier.

Back in the 1960s and ’70s, scientists studied retroviruses that caused cancer in animals, but weren’t associated with human disease. They discovered that these viruses produce a long protein and that, for the viruses to successfully replicate in cells, this protein needs to be cut into smaller pieces by an enzyme known as a protease. The researchers figured out that interfering with the protease kills the virus. And AIDS researchers in the 1980s and ’90s built on this knowledge to create extremely effective antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors.

The experience shows how curiosity-driven basic research of no apparent significance to people can transform human health in unexpected ways.

That kind of basic science is under siege — and has been since even before President Donald Trump began calling for cuts to medical research. At the end of the George W. Bush administration, the National Institutes of Health started to demand evidence that the research it funds have “significance” to human health — some indication that it will improve “scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice.” Yet as the AIDS story demonstrates, the significance of research may be evident only in retrospect.

Humanity has never needed science more than it does today, as it confronts existential threats from environmental degradation, population growth, new infectious diseases, climate change, antibiotic resistance and a failing green revolution — to name a few. Tackling these problems will require generous and consistent investment in all sorts of basic science, whether or not it has any practical application that’s obvious today.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics to develop single test to detect 9 illnesses,"A local manufacturer hopes to develop a single rapid test for nine fever-related diseases, officials announced Tuesday.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. of Medford said it is working with FIND, a nonprofit based in Geneva, Switzerland, to develop the test, which is aimed at improving treatment of the illnesses in Asia.

Chembio products can already detect multiple diseases with one blood test. The company’s technology now will be applied to a point-of-care test for nine illnesses, including malaria, dengue, Zika, chikungunya and leptospirosis.

“Our platform offers the ability to develop rapid diagnostic tests that are simple, cost effective and capable of testing for multiple pathogens simultaneously,” said Chembio CEO John Sperzel.

He also said the collaboration with FIND would benefit RVR Diagnostics, a Malaysian manufacturer acquired by Chembio last year.

Dr. Catharina Boehme, CEO of FIND, said the new test “would guide the appropriate use of medicines” and combat the growing resistance to some medicines because of misdiagnosis.

“We urgently need tests like this to ensure effective treatment and care of patients, as well as for the responsible stewardship of antibiotics and other medicines,” she said.

In addition, the executives said FIND is helping Chembio try out a test for Ebola, Marburg and two other diseases in Africa and South America.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics reports $2.6 million loss for quarter,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. Tuesday reported a larger loss for the October-December period compared with a year earlier because of fewer sales of its rapid tests for HIV and syphilis.

The Medford-based manufacturer of tests used to diagnosis sexually transmitted and tropical diseases such as Ebola and malaria posted a loss of $2.6 million for the three months ended Dec. 31. That’s a 294 percent increase from the same quarter in 2015, when losses totaled $649,000.

Sales also fell in the October-December period to $4.3 million, down nearly 4 percent compared with $4.4 million a year earlier.

CEO John Sperzel said the decline “was primarily due to the previously disclosed loss” of sales in Brazil for HIV and syphilis tests. A competitor underbid Chembio for the work, he said.

The company also lost sales in the United States of an HIV test as it took over the sales from an independent distributor.

Sperzel said Chembio recently won a two-year contract to provide HIV tests to Florida state government and a two-year contract for HIV tests to an undisclosed state. Together, the contracts are expected to generate $2 million between this year and next year.

The company also hopes to complete U.S. clinical trials for a combination HIV and syphilis test by March 31.

Chembio recently won contracts in Southeast Asia that will add $1.5 million to this year’s sales.

He has animatedly patrolled the sidelines as coach of his hometown Bridgehampton High School boys basketball team for the past 27 seasons, but the buzz is about to subside. The King Bee is retiring.

Johnson played for the Killer Bees in the era before the three-point shot and coached them on the same court, one so tiny you cannot shoot a three from the corners because you’d be out of bounds. Naturally, the old-school gym has a stage at one end and is known as the Bee Hive.

Johnson, 55, will step off the stage and out of the spotlight after Bridgehampton concludes the 2016-17 season. The Killer Bees (14-7), who have won nine state titles, will play S.S. Seward on Monday at Mount St. Mary College in Newburgh in a state Class D regional semifinal, with the ultimate goal of matching Mount Vernon’s record of 10 state titles.

“Hopefully, we can go out on a good note,” Johnson said.

He has won four state titles as a head coach — most recently in 2015, when several busloads of fans followed the team to Glens Falls — and played on the teams that won the first three in school history from 1978-80 in Rochester, where Johnson recalled, “We had four fans follow us.”

However his swan song turns out, Johnson, who has a 330-218 career record, has hit all the right notes in the small, close-knit community since moving there from North Carolina at age 9. “I moved here in 1970 and I was a North Carolina fan — Dean Smith and the four corners,” Johnson said. “But the kids I met were all Knicks fans. That influenced me because that particular Knicks team was good and played well together. I tried to base my Bridgehampton teams on that philosophy. We never had size, so it was all about moving the ball and playing team defense. Everything was team, team, team.”

That mantra helped Johnson win, win, win. He was the sixth man on Bridgehampton’s first state championship team in 1978 and the starting guard on the 1979 and 1980 state Class D champs, earning Newsday All-Long Island honors in 1980.

“The first one was magical because I remembered crying as a kid watching Bridgehampton lose in the county tournament. It was heart-wrenching,” Johnson said. “I wanted to do everything I could to bring a championship home to Bridgehampton. I was in the right place at the right time and the states became a big part of our tradition.”

It’s a community’s basketball tradition he has lovingly cultivated and hopes to continue in retirement at the grass-roots level. “The time is right for me,” said Johnson, who will remain a teacher in the school’s special education department. “There’s a need to coach the kids coming up. That’s where my passion is right now. Are they getting it right? Are they being taught the fundamentals? I don’t think so. So I’ll work with the youngsters, starting around 6. That’s a good age. They haven’t been influenced so much by the ESPN highlights.”

Johnson already has had an impact on the youth of Bridgehampton. One of his former players, Nick Thomas, has been the boys basketball coach at Center Moriches since 2012 and recently defeated his mentor in the Suffolk B-CD game.

“My relationship with Coach began when I was a freshman and it extended off the court,” Thomas said. “He’s like family. He molded me into a point guard, but more importantly, he molded me into a leader. He’s been my mentor since I first stepped onto the floor.”

Thomas was the starting point guard on Johnson’s first state championship team as a coach, when the Killer Bees defeated West Canada Valley in 1996. That was the first of three straight state titles, as Johnson the coach duplicated the feats of Johnson the player.

“I just wanted to win one as a coach so my players would know how it feels,” Johnson said. “That one was my favorite because Nick Thomas and that bunch had lost a heartbreaker at the buzzer in the regionals the year before. They were determined to come back and win one. I didn’t even have to motivate them. I like to think about how special it is that Nick was my point guard, my captain, my leader. And now all those leadership qualities he had as a player are showing as a coach at Center Moriches.”

Thomas, with affection, called Johnson “the caretaker of our legacy that runs deep into the roots of our community. He’s coached fathers and sons. He’s coached against his own players. Coach has been the common denominator throughout all of that.

“I look forward to one day becoming only the second person in New York state history to win a state championship as a player and a coach,” Thomas said, adding with a sly smile, “and both of us, rightfully so, would be Killer Bees.”",04/03/2017
NewsDay,Jevon McFerrin temporarily replacing Javier Muñoz in ‘Hamilton’,"Javier Muñoz, who succeeded Lin-Manuel Miranda in “Hamilton” last July, has a back injury and is on temporary medical leave. Filling in for him as the world’s hippest Founding Father is standby Jevon McFerrin, who joined Broadway’s mega-phenomenon in September and played his first Alexander in January.

Muñoz has been closely identified with Miranda’s work for years. He succeeded the composer/author/actor as the lead in his first Broadway hit, “In the Heights,” in 2009 and was the star’s alternate since 2015. Muñoz, who has been HIV positive since 2002, is also a cancer survivor who had surgery and radiation in the fall of 2015, before returning to the show.

McFerrin is the son of jazz star Bobby McFerrin and grandson of the late opera baritone Robert McFerrin. In a tweet yesterday, Muñoz said, “Part of a successful healing is knowing that the show is in the masterful hands of alternate & friend @JevonMcFerrin.”

A “Hamilton” spokesman confirmed the back injury but wouldn’t say if he was hurt during performance or when the injury occurred.",23/02/2017
NewsDay,"Bay Street Theater, The Gateway unveil summer lineup","The collective judgment of celebrity groundhogs calls for another three weeks of winter. But since spring training has sprung, it’s not too early to think about summertime — or summer theater — at Long Island’s two leading seasonal companies, which recently announced their seasons.

BAY STREET THEATER, SAG HARBOR

“The Man in the Ceiling,” a world premiere musical by Pulitzer cartoonist Jules Feiffer and Andrew Lippa, Tony-winning producer of “Hamilton,” opens the Sag Harbor theater’s season May 30. Based on Feiffer’s semi-autobiographical novel, “Man in the Ceiling,” was featured last April in a reading during Bay Street’s New Play Festival. “We’re thrilled to bring a show we helped nurture to a fully realized production,” says Bay Street artistic director Scott Schwartz. It runs through June 25.

Schwartz directs “Intimate Apparel,” July 4-30, a play by Pulitzer-winning author Lynn Nottage (“Ruined”), which introduces us to an African-American seamstress who in 1905 becomes a success making lingerie for society ladies and “ladies of the night.”

Shakespeare closes Bay Street’s season with “As You Like It,” directed by Tony winner John Doyle (2005 “Sweeney Todd” revival), Aug. 8-Sept. 3. Enjoy again the cross-dressing adventures of Rosalind, one of Shakespeare’s most spirited women, as she finds romance in the enchanted Forest of Arden.

THE GATEWAY, BELLPORT/PATCHOGUE

The classic millennial-generation musical “Rent” comes of age. (It opened on Broadway in 1996.) The Gateway launches its season May 17 with the Pulitzer- and Tony-winning musical inspired by Puccini’s “La Boheme” and marked by both real-life and fictional tragedy. Its creator, Adelphi alum Jonathan Larson, died of an undiagnosed aortic condition the night before his show’s Off-Broadway debut. Like his characters, he was a young artist struggling to get by in the shadow of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Through June 3.

The 1999 revue “Swing!” celebrates the music of such legends as Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Benny Goodman. Their repertoire, including “It Don’t Mean a Thing,” “Stompin’ at the Savoy” and “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,” has enjoyed a renaissance on TV’s “Dancing With the Stars” and “So You Think You Can Dance.” June 7 through June 24.

“On the Town,” the musical boasting top-notch creative-team pedigree — Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green — drops anchor in Bellport June 28-July 15. It’s the musical-comedy tale of three sailors on shore leave during World War II for a night on the town in “New York, New York,” title of the iconic song heard at every Yankees game, crooned by Frank Sinatra.

The Gateway moves to Patchogue July 19-Aug. 5 for the jukebox musical based on disco-era hits by ABBA, among them “Dancing Queen” and “Winner Takes It All.” It is about a mom who’s unable to tell her daughter on the eve of her wedding which of three ex-beaus is eligible to give her away. The prospective fathers of the bride all show up. Hence, the exclamation point in “Mamma Mia!”

Returning to Gateway Playhouse, the season winds up Aug. 23-Sept. 9 with “Little Shop of Horrors.” The Off-Broadway classic by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman satirizes the horror-film genre to a Motown and doo-wop beat in such campy songs as “Suddenly Seymour.” He’s the flower-shop clerk who tends a voraciously carnivorous plant named after his true love, Audrey.

NewsDay,Intel dropped its science fair. Bad idea.,"Last week, the Society for Science and the Public announced that Intel has stopped sponsoring the society’s International Science and Engineering Fair, a 70-year-old high school research competition.

This isn’t a big surprise, given that a year ago Intel dropped its sponsorship of another flagship science fair run by the same nonprofit group. But still, it’s an unfortunate move.

Intel hasn’t issued a statement explaining its decision (although it has expressed a continuing commitment to science education). The New York Times suggests that the choice reflects a view that science fairs have “become tilted to life sciences and biotechnology, not primary fields for Intel,” which makes computer chips.

I’ve been involved in science fairs for years - once upon a time as a competitor and now as a volunteer judge. So I’m not an objective observer. But I can tell you that if Intel is indeed backing out because of a perceived disciplinary mismatch, that’s a shortsighted move.

First of all, it’s not clear that life sciences completely dominate the field.

All three of last year’s top winners submitted cross-disciplinary engineering research. One developed an electronic knee brace for aiding polio patients. Another built an alternative battery component that could improve safety (important in an era of exploding cell phones). The third - the only one of the three who was working in biology - concocted E. coli bacteria that can convert organic waste into electricity “at a cost that is competitive with solar.” (Reminder, because it’s easy to forget: These are high school students. The knee brace was developed by a 15-year-old.)

Moreover, research training is portable, and many students switch fields. For example, a student of mine who worked on bioinformatics in high school has spent time in Silicon Valley in college.

But most importantly, high school research competitions aren’t just about the projects.

For sure, the students who participate produce incredible work. (In addition to the examples listed above, recent competition alumni have spotted possible planets, invented inexpensive HIV tests, and made significant advances in ultra-theoretical math.)

More than anything else, however, science research competitions help students start building a network of scientific colleagues and collaborators that energizes and enhances their scientific work. For many, that network is the key to staying (and succeeding) in science, technology, engineering or math.

I’m still in close touch with many of my science fair contemporaries. And several students I’ve met while judging at research competitions have reached out to me for academic and scientific advice.

Science is becoming increasingly cross-disciplinary, and increasingly international - so the earlier students start building their networks, the better. Additionally, many science fair participants have few if any classmates engaged in research - in that case, attending research competitions can be a first opportunity to find friends with similar interests.

This makes science more productive and more fun for all involved. That’s good for the future of research, and will certainly have spillovers to industry - including tech.

So science fairs are worth sponsoring. They don’t just produce research results - they build networks that boost U.S. and global progress. That’s something everyone should be able to get behind.

NewsDay,NYC proposes spending increase to fight rising STD levels,"New York City’s rates of sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have hit the highest levels since the 1980s, but new cases of HIV have actually fallen by more than 30 percent over the last five years.

To contain the outbreak and push the HIV rate even lower, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration is proposing to spend more public money than in recent memory, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office.

The mayor’s $84.7 billion proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year allocates about $25.7 million for the city health department’s Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Disease Control, according to the budget office.

The money is funding longer hours at the city’s STD clinics, increasing the number of body parts the clinics can swab and expanding the distribution of the HIV-prevention medicine Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis, said Dr. Jay Varma, deputy commissioner for disease control.

Varma said funding for STD programs went down in the aftermath of the Great Recession. When measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, spending fell about 20 percent between 2007 and 2016, the budget office said.

The total number of STD cases hit 81,399 in 2015, the latest year for which statistics are available, compared to 52,113 in 2006, according to the budget office.

In 2006, out of 100,000 New Yorkers, about 515 had chlamydia, 129 had gonorrhea and 7 had syphilis. In 2015, 742 had chlamydia, 199 had gonorrhea and 18 had syphilis, according to the budget office.

The number of STD diagnoses is higher than they’ve been in decades nationwide, too.

Of the latest spike, syphilis is one of the STDs with which officials are “most concerned,” Varma said. The disease can “lead to very serious health problems” if left untreated and have “devastating” effects if passed to a baby.

Higher-than-average STD rates are seen in men who have sex with men, including blacks and Latinos, officials said. The city health department is focusing on those groups to encourage testing, treatment, and the use of condoms and Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis.

Frustrating efforts to combat STDs is the widespread use of location-based hookup apps like Grindr, Varma said. Investigators trying to track down an infected person’s sexual partners can no longer rely on visiting a bathhouse or a bar, since many encounters begin online, he added.

“We consider those apps to be like a virtual bathhouse,” Varma said, but “people are less likely to know the names” or have reliable contact information for those partners from the apps.",08/02/2017
NewsDay,"Letter: Loose regulation, fund cuts cost lives","The writer’s optimism regarding health care and the environment, as expressed in the Jan. 22 letter “Healing means considering all sides,” is misguided.

Look to the actions taken by conservatives in Republican states. In Indiana, with Mike Pence as governor, the only HIV testing site in Scott County was closed by funding cuts in 2013. Subsequently, there has been an HIV outbreak in that county, with 190 new cases through 2016.

In Texas, where multiple women’s clinics have closed, the maternal mortality rate has skyrocketed to be the highest in the nation — higher than in most developed countries. In 2010, it was 18.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. In 2013, the rate of mostly preventable deaths had increased to 36.1 per 100,000.

Earthquakes in Oklahoma with a magnitude of more than 3.1 have increased to more than 1,000 in 2015, from as few as two in 2008, since the introduction of fracking.

These are just a few brief examples of serious problems on the state level, but they portend a calamity on the national level. People are dying and will continue to die, and 50 years of progress will be reversed.

NewsDay,Plants for a bee-friendly garden,"Kids often bristle at mention of the word “bees,” but gardeners seldom do. That’s because we know we need them, and barring allergies, bees don’t really pose much of a threat. They aren’t aggressive and usually don’t attack unless they sense danger to themselves or their hive. Stepping on or swatting a bee would qualify as a perceived threat, as would invading a hive, but gardening alongside a few busy bees seldom results in a sting.

A few years back, I visited with a beekeeper and eventually took off my gloves and face protection. Dozens of them covered my skin and, yet, it was oddly calming. I didn’t sustain even one sting.

Yellow jackets are another story; they’re not bees but rather wasps, which often attack without provocation. For most bees, a sting is a weapon of last resort: An attack ensures the bee’s certain death because the insect’s stinger is torn from its abdomen when it withdraws. Yellow jackets, on the other hand, will sting you a dozen times and live to laugh about it with their friends. Big difference.

Bees collect nectar from plants and transfer pollen from flower to flower, which enables fertilization and the subsequent production of fruits, vegetables and seeds. They are the real heroes of the garden, but they need something from us in return: specific plants that provide the food they need. Reward them by restoring their dwindling habitat and planting these flowers and herbs to help ensure their survival. We can’t survive without them, either.

Bee balm

Give it nutrient-rich soil, plenty of sun and water, and this perennial will reward you with years of unusually shaped flowers. Enjoy the parade of butterflies, hummingbirds and bees that march by, and dry the leaves for tea. But plant it judiciously — in a field, meadow or section of the garden where you want it to spread; bee balm is related to mint, and will behave accordingly.

Borage

Best Bets Get the scoop on events, nightlife, day trips, family fun and things to do on Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

An annual herb also called “starflower” for its showy blue blossoms. Borage, which has a taste reminiscent of cucumber, can be used in salads or added to seafood recipes. Harvest leaves while they’re young and velvety — before they become prickly.

Cosmos

American yellow cosmos can reach 7 feet tall, but some hybrids are much shorter. Plant these annuals, which also are available in white, pink, orange and purple, in full sun and shear once a month for best results. Don’t bother fertilizing — or providing too much water; they’ll do better without.

Dill

Because it is prone to transplant shock, it’s best to start this herb from seed, directly in the garden, after the danger of frost has passed. Select a spot in direct sun with well-draining soil. Remove buds before flowers form for continued leaf production. Although an annual, it is not uncommon for dill to self-sow and return the following year.

Milkweed

Bees aren’t the only insects that depend upon milkweed for survival: It’s the only larval food source for monarch butterfly caterpillars in North America. According to the National Wildlife Federation, the plant’s “increasing scarcity” is “one of the biggest factors in monarch decline.” The tender perennial is treated like an annual here in zone 7.

Nasturtium

Nasturtiums grow best in full sun and prefer well-draining soil, so they’re well-suited for the sandy shore. While attracting bees, the annuals repel aphids, spider mites and whiteflies. They’ll even improve the flavor of tomatoes planted nearby.

Orlaya

This annual sports intricate lacy white flowers atop upright stems on well-branched plants. Plant in full sun, but be aware they tend to wither in extreme heat.

Penstemon

Available in a variety of colors, these perennials bloom from late spring through summer and are well-suited for full sun. Drought- and heat-tolerant.

Sunflowers

Plant in loose, well-draining soil, then stand back! Some sunflower varieties can grow to more than 15 feet tall. Plant seeds directly in the garden after the danger of frost has passed, and give them plenty of room, sunlight and fertilizer.

Zinnia

Available in an array of jewel-tone colors and various shapes and sizes, there’s a zinnia for everyone. Heat-loving and easy to grow, these annuals bloom from spring through fall. Plant in full sun in rich, moist soil.",27/01/2017
NewsDay,Chembio wins approval to sell HIV-syphilis test overseas,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has secured approval to sell its combination test for HIV and syphilis in most of Europe and the Caribbean, officials said.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid diagnostic tests received the CE mark, which allows products to be sold in the European Union and the Caribbean, except for Puerto Rico.

Earlier, Chembio won approval to sell the test in Mexico and Brazil.

The blood test for HIV and syphilis provides a result in about 15 minutes and can be stored at room temperature. It has a shelf life of up to two years.

CEO John Sperzel said last week the test “can play a role in the global initiative to reduce transmission of HIV and syphilis to unborn children, as well as screen certain populations to address growing HIV and syphilis co-infection rates.”

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate there is a two- to fivefold increase in the risk of contracting HIV if the patient has already been exposed to syphilis. The centers also estimate that 2 million pregnancies each year are affected by mother-to-child transmission of HIV and/or syphilis, resulting in high rates of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight and perinatal death.

Sperzel said Chembio hopes to introduce the combination test in the United States once a clinical trial is completed. He said the company would apply for U.S. regulatory approval early this year.",24/01/2017
NewsDay,2 Nassau teens nominated for Presidential Scholars Program,"Five Long Island teens were among 25 statewide last month to be nominated for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program.

The recognition is considered one of the nation’s highest honors for high school students, with one boy and one girl from each state named Presidential Scholars.

Nominees from Nassau are Michael Bailey of Elmont Memorial High School and Sofia Gutierrez of West Hempstead High School. Suffolk nominees are Victoria Blydenburgh of Westhampton Beach High School; Siena Gates of Southampton High School; and Epiphany Ramirez of Walt Whitman High School in South Huntington.

“All of these nominees have demonstrated exceptional academic success, artistic excellence or career skills development,” State Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia said. “They represent the best of New York’s future and show a real drive to make the world a better place.”

The U.S. Department of Education invites students to apply based on SAT or ACT scores, or nominations from Chief State School Officers or other authorized organizations. Candidates then undergo a rigorous application process and are subsequently evaluated on factors ranging from academic achievement to extracurricular involvements.

About 800 semifinalists will be announced in April, with scholars announced in May. Scholars will receive an expense-paid trip this summer to Washington, and a medallion during a ceremony sponsored by the White House.

“I never would’ve thought from all the students in New York that I’d be nominated,” Gutierrez said. “It’s amazing.”

NewsDay,"We can help addicts, even those still using drugs","Now 40, Jennifer S. is a heroin addict from Selden who has used the opiate since she was 13 years old. She’s been clean for years at a time, and she’s been jailed for years at a time. She shoots up three or four times a day and has a husband and a home and a job. Actually, two jobs. She’s an office manager and bookkeeper, and she works for Community Action for Social Justice, the only “harm reduction” and syringe-exchange program on Long Island. Jennifer helps addicts stay alive, people like her who aren’t ready to stop using.

Harm reduction is a big challenge, one made more difficult by a system that focuses most resources on preventing addictions and treating addicts ready to quit. To many, driving resources and compassion toward active addicts feels like enabling. But both the resources and compassion are necessary, because no one’s ready to quit until he or she is ready, and because no one can get better if he or she is dead.

Naloxone, the drug that snaps users out of heroin or painkiller overdoses, plays a big part in harm reduction. Huge strides have been made in Naloxone distribution and training by police departments, municipalities, social services and volunteer groups. Yet overdose deaths continue to skyrocket. In 2015, 3,009 people in New York State died of drug overdoses, and more than three-quarters were attributable to opioids. Tina Wolf, executive director of Community Action for Social Justice, says part of the answer lies in making sure addicts themselves have Naloxone, not just the concerned parents and community members trained in its use. Opioid users are the people who overdose and hang out with others who do. Advocates say that to save lives, government — federal, state and local — should mandate and fund programs that hand Naloxone to addicts when they walk out of a jail, hospital or rehab center. Yet, that’s almost never done.

A peer outreach worker like Jennifer, who didn’t want her last name used, is a great resource, because she can make sure her drug-using acquaintances have Naloxone and know how to use it. And she can work to reduce a variety of other harms for them, too, because opioid addicts face plenty of dangers beyond overdosing.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis C is the deadliest infectious disease in the United States, killing almost 20,000 people in 2014, with a new wave of infections among those who inject drugs. More than 1.2 million people have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. These diseases are a plague to people who inject drugs, and the best way to stop the spread is by dispensing free, clean needles and syringes, as well as condoms. With a budget from the state of about $500,000 a year, Community Action for Social Justice isn’t getting to most people who need help.

Wolf and her co-workers also talk to drug users about how to inject safely, and avoid overdoses, infections and vein problems. And when someone is ready for sobriety, they help with that, too. But they also stress the value of helping people maintain their health and dignity even if they are not ready to stop using.

Those who aren’t ready will use drugs, Jennifer says. Addiction is a disease, and taking risks to get high is a symptom. She says she has tried three times in the past year to get a bed in a detoxification clinic, but none have been available. And when she failed to get sober, she used drugs.

Harm reduction is needed after addiction prevention doesn’t work and before recovery takes hold. Experts say we are not spending nearly enough on it, not talking about it enough, not pushing hard enough to make sure active users stay alive and as healthy as possible. If the rising death toll from opioid addiction is to be reversed, if the most possible people are to recover, that has to change.— The editorial board",27/12/2016
NewsDay,"Smell, see and touch at Sweetbriar Nature Center in Smithtown","In the new interactive forest exhibit at the Sweetbriar Nature Center in Smithtown, kids can come eye-to-eye with a box turtle. If it weren’t for a glass dome separating them, they could probably give the turtle a kiss.

How can they get so close? Picture a king-size bed. A handful of box turtles lives on the top in a bed of wood chips. Kids crawl into a maze built underneath, pop their heads up into the dome in the middle of the “bed” and, if there’s a turtle looking into the dome at that moment, it’s a close encounter of the turtle kind.

“We wanted it to be interactive, really interactive through the different senses,” says Eric Young, Sweetbriar’s program director. “All in one little room.”

FITS THE MISSION

The dual mission of Sweetbrair includes nature education and wildlife rehabilitation. A half-dozen rooms in a 1930 house offer a home to animals such as a special-needs squirrel and a hive of honeybees. During warmer weather, people can wander the center’s 55 acres.

Sweetbriar runs school programs, scouting outings, school break offerings and birthday parties. It previously added a Tropical Rain Forest Room upstairs to simulate a rain forest environment with an intricate wooden bridge and a faux mangrove swamp. The only thing missing? “We can’t make it rain in here,” Young says.

The forest addition, which officially opens Dec. 26, both fits into and expands Sweetbriar’s offerings, Young says. The box turtles in the exhibit all are unable to live in the wild, for instance. “One is missing his front claw,” curator-artist Janine Bendicksen says. Another had a too-small shell due to malnutrition. “They all have a story,” she says.

The new room, created using a $3,400 New York State grant, flows from the upstairs Rain Forest Room. Many Long Island birds fly south to spend our winter in a rain forest, and back north to us for the summer, Young says.

FIVE SENSES

Sense of sight? Check. In addition to the live box turtles, kids in the forest room can learn about animals common to Long Island that Bendicksen has painted onto the walls, such as white deer, foxes and raccoons. The tunnel underneath the turtle area also has diorama boxes showing animals that live underground, such as a chipmunk.

Also in the room with the turtles is a 3-D wall display of three different trees — black birch, cedar and pine. “These trees all smell really wonderful,” Bendicksen says. Sense of smell? Check. Each tree has a jar of natural scents tucked into a knot hole.

Kids can play with pine cones and other woodland items at a touch table. Sense of touch? Check.

And at a computer screen, visitors take turns guessing which animal is making a certain sound. Is it a katydid? A chipmunk? An owl? Sense of hearing? Check.

The Democratic mayor said he believes a repeal is less politically palatable for Trump if additional people are signed up. He added that more insured New Yorkers means a healthier population and lower costs to the taxpayer, who must pay to treat the uninsured at city-run emergency rooms.

“The more and more Americans that sign up for the ACA, the harder it is to take it away,” de Blasio said, using an abbreviation for Obamacare’s formal title: the Affordable Care Act.

Congressional Republicans have promised to begin to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law soon after Trump is sworn in, with the effective date delayed several years for a full phaseout.

De Blasio announced the push at a city-owned medical facility on Manhattan’s Lower East Side.

At his side: an unemployed social worker insured by Obamacare, a cancer-stricken porter who would be uninsured but for the government-sponsored program, and an HIV-positive city councilman who recounted his yearslong struggle to navigate the health care system before he had city medical coverage.

“What the Republicans and the president-elect are proposing is immoral. It is immoral! People’s lives are at stake,” said the councilman, Corey Johnson (D-Manhattan).

De Blasio aims to enroll about 50,000 through 2017 of the 500,000 eligible uninsured population in the city. New Yorkers can reach the program by visiting a #GetCoveredNYC venue, calling 311 or texting CoveredNYC to 877-877. De Blasio estimated the cost for ads and door-to-door outreach to be about $8 million.

The current enrollment period ends Jan. 31. Costs depend on income, starting at free for the poorest New Yorkers. People in the United States illegally are ineligible.

Stanley Brezenoff, interim head of the city’s public hospital system, said enrolling the 50,000 uninsured could save the city as much as $40 million.

De Blasio bemoaned the “sworn commitment to destroy” Obamacare by Trump and the national GOP. Since Trump’s election last month, de Blasio has promised to try to protect New Yorkers from Trump’s campaign agenda, such as curbing funding to abortion-provider Planned Parenthood, creating a Muslim registry and rounding up and deporting immigrants in the country illegally.

“Well, we can’t take that lying down,” de Blasio said. “We as New Yorkers need to fight back.”

A Trump representative did not return a message seeking comment.

The number of uninsured adult New Yorkers dropped to about 12.6 percent from about 21 percent soon after the health care legislation became law, according to the city health commissioner, Dr. Mary Bassett.",20/12/2016
NewsDay,"Henry Heimlich, life-saving maneuver creator, dies at 96","CINCINNATI - The surgeon who created the life-saving Heimlich maneuver for choking victims died early Saturday in Cincinnati. Dr. Henry Heimlich was 96.

His son, Phil, said he died at Christ Hospital after suffering a heart attack earlier in the week.

""My father was a great man who saved many lives,"" said Heimlich, an attorney and former Hamilton County commissioner. ""He will be missed not only by his family but by all of humanity.""

Heimlich was director of surgery at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati in 1974 when he devised the treatment for choking victims that made his name a household word.

Rescuers using the procedure abruptly squeeze a victim's abdomen, pushing in and above the navel with the fist to create a flow of air from the lungs. That flow of air then can push objects out of the windpipe and prevent suffocation.

Much of Heimlich's 2014 autobiography focuses on the maneuver, which involves thrusts to the abdomen that apply upward pressure on the diaphragm to create an air flow that forces food or other objects out of the windpipe.

The Cincinnati chest surgeon told The Associated Press in a February 2014 interview that thousands of deaths reported annually from choking prompted him in 1972 to seek a solution. During the next two years, he led a team of researchers at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. He successfully tested the technique by putting a tube with a balloon at one end down an anesthetized dog's airway until it choked. He then used the maneuver to force the dog to expel the obstruction.

The Wilmington, Delaware, native estimated the maneuver has saved the lives of thousands of choking victims in the United States alone. It earned him several awards and worldwide recognition. His name became a household word.

The maneuver was adopted by public health authorities, airlines and restaurant associations, and Heimlich appeared on shows including the ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" and ""The Today Show.""

His views on how the maneuver should be used and on other innovations he created or proposed put him at odds with some in the health field. He said his memoir was an effort to preserve his technique.

""I know the maneuver saves lives, and I want it to be used and remembered,"" he told the AP. ""I felt I had to have it down in print so the public will have the correct information.""

The maneuver has continued to make headlines. Clint Eastwood was attending a golf event in Monterey, California, in 2014 when the then-83-year-old actor saw the tournament director choking on a piece of cheese and successfully performed the technique.

""The best thing about it is that it allows anyone to save a life,"" Heimlich told the AP.

In 2016, Heimlich himself was the hero, saving a woman choking on food at his senior living center.

Heimlich said the maneuver is very effective when used correctly, but he did not approve of American Red Cross guidelines calling for back blows followed by abdominal thrusts in choking cases that don't involve infants or unconscious victims. Red Cross officials said evidence shows using multiple methods can be more effective, but Heimlich said blows can drive obstructions deeper into a windpipe. The American Heart Association backs abdominal thrusts.

Neither organization supports Heimlich's view that using the maneuver to remove water from the lungs could save drowning victims. They recommend CPR.

Heimlich was proud of some of his other innovations, such as a chest drain valve credited by some with saving soldiers and civilians during the Vietnam War. But he drew sharp criticism for his theory that injecting patients with a curable form of malaria could trigger immunity in patients with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Medical experts have said injecting patients with malaria would be dangerous and have criticized Heimlich for conducting studies involving malariotherapy on HIV patients in China.

Heimlich mostly brushed off critics.

""I'll be the first to admit that a number of my ideas are controversial and in some ways unorthodox,"" Heimlich told the AP. ""But I have enough guts to know that when I am right, it will come about as the thing to do, even if others do the wrong thing for a time.""

One of his most vocal critics has been his son, Peter Heimlich. The younger Heimlich split with his father years ago over a personal rift. He initially circulated anonymous criticisms of his father before openly speaking out against him online and in media interviews.

Peter Heimlich has called many of his father's theories dangerous and spent years challenging many of his claims and trying to discredit them. The elder Heimlich maintained that his relationship with his son was a family matter refused to comment on it to the media.

The elder Heimlich attended Cornell University undergraduate and medical schools and interned at Boston City Hospital. During World War II, the U.S. Navy sent him to northwest China in 1942 to treat Chinese and American forces behind Japanese lines in the Gobi Desert.

Beginning in the 1950s, he held staff surgeon positions at New York's Metropolitan Hospital and Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center. He later was an attending surgeon on the staffs at Jewish and Deaconess hospitals in Cincinnati and a researcher at his nonprofit Heimlich Institute.

Heimlich's wife Jane, daughter of the late dance teacher Arthur Murray, died in November 2012.

He is survived by two sons and two daughters.

Phil Heimlich said a private family service and burial is planned soon. The family hopes to arrange a public memorial, he added, that will give his father's friends and admirers a chance to pay their respects.",17/12/2016
NewsDay,‘How to Survive a Plague’ review: David France’s exhaustive history of AIDS activism,"HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE: The Inside Story of How Citizens and Science Tamed AIDS, by David France. Alfred A. Knopf, 624 pp., $30.

There are two things you need to know about David France’s book “How to Survive a Plague.”

First: It’s flawless. Masterfully written, impeccably researched, and full of feeling for the living and dead heroes of the AIDS movement. Activists Peter Staley, Mark Harrington and Michael Callen are developed like characters in a novel, and a huge cast of players behind them is memorably brought to life. There can be no clearer picture of the uphill battle against ignorance and bigotry that was the raison d’être of organizations like Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP in the 1980s and ’90s.

Second: It’s too much. Exhaustive, and also exhausting. You feel you are reading about every meeting, every protest, every drug trial, every news story, every falling-out in every splinter group, every pamphlet and position paper, and every outburst from Larry Kramer, the famously cranky playwright who inspired AIDS activism. When you get to page 440 and it says “the calendar turned to 1991,” all you can think is, Dear God, only 1991?

Fortunately, France has also produced a highly watchable, Oscar-nominated documentary with the same title, available on the web. The film, assembled from archival footage and interviews, hits most of the high points of the story. Should you want more after seeing the movie, the book is perfect.

I imagine many readers have some personal connection to the saga of AIDS in the years from its first appearance in 1981, to 1998, the year The Bay Area Reporter ran a “screaming headline” on the front page: “NO OBITS.” Mine is a close one. I was married to a gay man who was diagnosed in 1985 and died in 1994, very shortly before protease inhibitors started saving lives. The acronyms that pepper every page of this book — HIV, AIDS, PWA, AZT, CD4, HTLV-3, GRID, PCP, KS and GMHC, to name a few — were a big part of my vocabulary for years, and the vision of young men dying horribly is burned onto my retinas.

It’s a rough trip down memory lane, and the aspects of the nightmare that were under human control are particularly painful to revisit. It’s easy to forget how long the government, under presidents Reagan and Bush, refused to pay attention or spend money on the epidemic. Cataloged alongside that are all the useless drugs, from Compound Q to the ballyhooed AZT, which was hard to get, ludicrously expensive and ultimately worthless, yet absorbed the attention of activists and scientists for years.

France was there through almost the whole thing, working as a journalist. He was at the New York Native, a biweekly gay newspaper, in the early days, as the gay community agonized over what caused the disease, and safe sex was first promoted as a way to prevent its spread. He was at the early meetings of the groups that formed to respond to the crisis, including the brave and wild ACT UP.

For a while he worked “undercover” at the New York Post, hoping he might influence their coverage. He cut his hair, retired his earrings and swapped his Chuck Taylors for Thom McAns, but was fired before his trial period was over. “Found out you’re gay,” said his editor. “We don’t need infiltrators here, bloke, not homosexuals in the investigations department.”

But that’s exactly what they did need. Gay men were at the center of every bit of progress made. Because the federal response was so profoundly inadequate and disorganized, citizens’ organizations played a crucial role even in organizing drug trials. By 1994, activists were meeting directly with pharmaceutical executives — quite a change from the days of storming and occupying their offices.

France was there at the beginning, and he was there at the end, at the meeting at NYU Medical Center where protease inhibitors — the drugs that stopped HIV from being a certain death sentence — were announced: “When the room emptied out, I found myself standing in the sun-creased lobby watching the men in the audience exchanging hugs and tears. I noticed how incongruously young everyone looked in the snow-whitened light. Most were like, me, not yet middle aged. . . . I’d lived my entire adult life in the eye of unrelenting death. We all had . . .

“It would never be over. But it was over.”

No better way to say it. No better person to write this book, which had to be written, creating a complete and correct record of this terrible story and its heroes.",28/11/2016
NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics sales fall 46 percent, loss widens","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Thursday reported sharply wider losses for the July-September period compared with a year earlier as sales of its rapid diagnostic tests fell 46percent.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV, Ebola, malaria and other tropical diseases said its loss totaled $2.1 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, up from a loss of $437,000 a year ago.

Sales in the third quarter fell to $3.8 million from $6.9 million a year earlier.

CEO John Sperzel said sales of HIV and syphilis tests had dropped in the past six months but would increase in the future.

He said there is “strong evidence that we are effectively rebuilding” sales of HIV tests in the United States, which used to be handled by a third-party distributor until Chembio assumed that responsibility in stages, beginning in June 2014.

Sperzel also said Chembio is making progress in bringing to market a blood test for Zika, a virus spread primarily by mosquitoes that causes severe birth defects.

“We believe Chembio is on a path to establish a global operation with potential for growth in several important markets,” he said.

The company employs 155 people in Medford and Holbrook, and last week announced the purchase of a small tests manufacturer in Malaysia for $3.5 million.

Chembio shares closed down 15 cents, or more than 2 percent, to $6.70 on the Nasdaq stock market. Shares have climbed $1.41, or 26 percent, in the past year.

NewsDay,Letter: Scam of HIV patients was unconscionable,"“Druggist gets prison in HIV medicine scam” [News, Oct. 28] is a classic, albeit shocking, example of what happens when protectors of the public trust and confidence become tricksters.

I am glad that the mastermind of the dubious scheme in reselling HIV drugs, Ira Gross of Babylon, has been brought to book and sentenced for his criminal acts. Attorney General Eric T.

NewsDay,Medford manufacturer to buy Malaysia firm for $3.5 million,"A Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, Ebola, Zika and other diseases announced yesterday an agreement to purchase a tests provider in Malaysia for up to $3.5 million.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. said it would buy RVR Diagnostics Sdn Bhd. The two companies have worked together since 2014.

Executives said the deal would close early next year and also involves Chembio forgiving debts of $250,000. RVR will become a subsidiary of Chembio.

“Our growth plans include expansion into the Asia Pacific region, and we believe a corporate presence in Malaysia, which is centrally located in Southeast Asia, will be a key success factor,” Chembio CEO John Sperzel said yesterday.

He also said RVR “has made excellent progress to establish a high-quality, low-cost manufacturing facility . . . We believe the combination of RVR’s cost-effective manufacturing competence and Chembio’s patented [testing] technology will allow Chembio to accelerate product registrations within Southeast Asia, where the population exceeds 600 million, and also to build a stronger presence in other regions.”

RVR has been the exclusive seller of Chembio’s point-of-care tests for HIV and syphilis in Southeast Asia for the past two years. The company also has collaborated with Chembio on a test for dengue fever that will become available later this year.

RVR’s sales of Chembio products are expected to total $1.5 million this year.

Mac Vajuram, RVR’s managing director, said, “Since its inception, RVR has been capitalized with a combination of the founders’ investments, public grants and research support from the National University of Malaysia, the country’s premier university . . . We believe this transaction will create additional growth opportunities in Asia and other markets.”

NewsDay,"LI businesses, labs on front lines of global war on Zika","Long Island businesses and research laboratories are on the front lines of the global war against the Zika virus.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. in Medford has met governmental standards to sell its diagnostic test in the Caribbean and Europe. A vaccine from Farmingdale-based Codagenix Inc. is being evaluated on mice. And Lakeland Industries Inc. of Ronkonkoma is supplying protective suits to people mixing insecticides to kill Zika-carrying mosquitoes.

At Stony Brook University, researchers are developing tests and vaccines. They also are examining how Zika is spread and why it persists in the human body longer than similar viruses.

“The great unknown is how prevalent Zika will become,” said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies the economic impact of diseases. “But there is definitely a need . . . And our research has demonstrated that when you do work that is to help public health, there also are tremendous business opportunities.”

There’s a sense of urgency in both industry and academia about Zika because infected pregnant women have given birth to babies with microcephaly, or abnormally small heads with brain damage.

Nearly 70 countries have confirmed cases of Zika, mainly in the Caribbean, South America and Oceania.

In the continental United States, New York State had the most cases, 883, as of Nov. 2. All these cases involved people who were bitten by mosquitoes while abroad or had sex with an infected individual.

The global market for Zika vaccines could exceed $1 billion per year, in part because the virus is active in tourist destinations, such as the Bahamas, Cayman Islands and Mexico, and travelers will pay for protection, according to the forecasts of financial analysts and industry CEOs.

They also forecast that the worldwide market for tests could be about $400 million per year.

Zika offers Chembio and Codagenix, in particular, the opportunity to demonstrate that their technology is safe, flexible and effective.

The research activities and operations of the two small businesses have been supported by hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants or private equity investment. Funders include the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and private foundations.

This support helps the businesses to compete with pharmaceutical giants such as Quest Diagnostics, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Pasteur and Takeda, executives said.

Government regulators, in particular, “know our technology platform, have worked with us already and seen that we deliver — that’s a strength,” said John Sperzel, CEO of Chembio, a manufacturer of diagnostic tests for Zika, Ebola, malaria and other tropical diseases.

The company won a contract from HHS in August, valued at up to $13.2 million, for the clinical trials and paperwork necessary to gain approval to sell a Zika test in this country and to further develop a combination test for Zika, chikungunya and dengue.

Chikungunya and dengue are both tropical diseases, transmitted by mosquitoes, and characterized by fever, as is Zika.

Both of Chembio’s point-of-care tests use blood samples and come with a battery-powered reader that provides a result in about 15 minutes.

Foundation grants and government contracts have been vital to Chembio, as it lost money for the past two years while expanding from its core business of rapid tests for HIV and syphilis.

The public company, which has 155 workers, posted a loss of $2.4 million last year, wider than 2014’s loss of $1.1 million. Sales for 2015 fell 12 percent, year over year, to $24 million.

Chembio has appointed managers and secured a distributor to begin selling Zika tests in the Caribbean and Europe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has committed to buying $330,000 worth of tests for a “surveillance testing program” in Guatemala, Haiti, India and Peru.

This week, Chembio won the first of several regulatory approvals needed to sell its Zika test in Brazil. The company also is pursuing approvals in Africa and Mexico.

Sperzel said Chembio’s competitive advantage is its technology to detect multiple viruses in one quick test.

The financial analysis firm BMI Research of London agreed, stating in February the “developers that will dominate the market are those that can target an entire febrile illness panel [viruses characterized by fever]. These firms will have a market that remains after the Zika outbreak has been controlled.”

Codagenix also hopes technology will give it a leg up on the competition.

The biotech startup has developed vaccines for Zika, influenza and other diseases. The vaccines provoke a stronger response from the immune system because they contain live viruses rather than the dead ones used in many other vaccines. The more robust response means better protection, said company co-founder and President Steffen Mueller.

Codagenix, using a software algorithm, weakens the virus’ impact by changing its DNA. “We knock the virus on its head to make it safe,” he said.

The company created its Zika vaccine in 27 days, and four versions are now being tested in mice in Utah under the auspices of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

In September, Topspin Partners, a private equity firm founded on Long Island, invested $2 million in Codagenix, to be used to prepare for clinical trials in humans in mid-2017.

“We won’t be first to market, but we think we can make a better vaccine,” said J. Robert Coleman, Codagenix co-founder and chief operating officer. “Our vaccine is less expensive to make because it requires less virus, and that’s important in the Third World” where many cannot afford costly vaccines.

The company hired an additional scientist because of the Zika work, bringing its payroll to seven people. Its main laboratory is in the Start-Up NY tax-free zone at Farmingdale State College.

Codagenix moved to the college in February after four years at Stony Brook University, where it began in the lab of Eckard Wimmer, a company co-founder and microbiology professor. He, Mueller and Coleman invented the technology used by Codagenix.

Wimmer and research scientist Charles B. Stauft still work with Codagenix. But they also are developing a different Zika vaccine using the same technology.

That work, together with a separate project by another researcher to create a Zika diagnostic test using urine samples, is being supported with $25,000 from the University’s School of Medicine.

Wimmer said Long Island’s cooler climate doesn’t protect against Zika, chikungunya or dengue. All are closely related to yellow fever, which he said had been carried by mosquitoes on sailing ships and caused outbreaks between 1791 and 1805 in Philadelphia and New York City.

Wimmer’s Stony Brook colleague, Erich R. Mackow, is studying how Zika interacts with endothelial cells, which line the inner walls of blood vessels. These cells are supposed to keep viruses from reaching the brain and, in a pregnant woman, the fetus.

He also is looking into whether Zika’s reaction with endothelial cells is a reason why Zika lasts months longer in humans than similar viruses.

“The endothelial cells are gatekeepers letting viruses into different places,” said Mackow, who is affiliated with the university’s Center for Infectious Diseases.

Zika takes its name from Uganda’s Zika Forest and was first discovered in 1947. The symptoms are generally mild in adults and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pain, headache and red eyes, according to the CDC.

Local combatants in the war on Zika aren’t limited to biotech companies and research institutions.

Lakeland Industries is selling protective clothing to governments carrying out massive insecticide programs in Miami, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela.

“The suits are worn when the insecticides are mixed, because some of them, in their pure form, are quite powerful,” said Lakeland CEO Christopher J. Ryan.

The protective suits are produced from U.S.-made fabric in Lakeland factories in China, India and Mexico, where most of the company’s 1,400 employees work.

However, unlike outbreaks of Ebola and bird flu, which generated millions of dollars in sales for the company, Zika will account for $125,000 to $150,000 for the fiscal year that ends Jan. 31.

The public company reported a profit of $8 million last year on sales of $100 million, excluding costs of selling its Brazil operation to executives there.

“Zika may show up next year,” said Ryan, “but . . . I don’t think it will be big money for us.”

Businesses involved in killing mosquitoes and developing diagnostic tests are most likely to benefit financially from Zika outbreaks, according to one expert.

“There is a lot of potential,” said Scott C. Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “But there’s also a lot of questions marks about the long-term outlook for profitability for some businesses, particularly if they are in vaccines,” which face a lengthy approval process by the federal Food and Drug Administration.

Still, he and others said Zika will remain a threat, even though growing numbers of people will gain immunity after being infected.

“Though the incidence of Zika will undoubtedly drop over the next couple of years, there is still going to be a demand for a vaccine,” said Weaver, who leads the Zika task force of the Global Virus Network, a research, education and advocacy group based in Baltimore.

“There is this visceral fear of seeing these babies with severe malformations,” he said. “People are much more afraid of Zika than other viruses that are bigger public health problems” such and dengue and chikungunya.",04/11/2016
NewsDay,U2's Bono first man to make Glamour's Women of the Year list,"Glamour's annual Women of the Year list always takes in a lot of territory, from noteworthy fashionistas and sports heroes to social justice activists and business leaders.

Enter Bono: The first Man of the Year among the magazine's Women of the Year, all to be honored at a Nov. 14 ceremony in Los Angeles.

""We've talked for years about whether to honor a man at Women of the Year and we've always kind of put the kabash on it. You know, men get a lot of awards and aren't exactly hurting in the celebration and honors department,"" said Cindi Leive, Glamour's editor-in-chief.

""But it started to seem that that might be an outdated way of looking at things, and there are so many men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days. Some men get it and Bono is one of those guys,"" Leive said in a recent interview.

And how's that?

Well, not just by talking the talk and wearing a feminist T-shirt, she said. Not that there's anything wrong with that stuff, of course.

Instead, the U2 frontman has turned his attention, his high-volume voice and presence as an activist, squarely on women and girls who need it the most, those in extreme poverty around the world. Last year, Bono and his One campaign launched a ""Poverty is Sexist"" movement, armed with facts and figures.

Roughly 62 million girls are denied a right to education around the world, according to a One report, and half a billion women can't read.

In a letter to world leaders, Bono and numerous other celebrity signers, from Robert Redford to Shonda Rhimes, called it an outrage that girls account for 74 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa.

""The idea that a man who could select any cause in the world to call his own, or no cause at all, is choosing to work, and not just for one night or at a special event, but consistently — day after day and month after month — on behalf of women is incredibly cool and absolutely deserves applause,"" Leive said, noting Bono's AIDS-fighting Red campaign as well.

So how did the man of the hour take the news? Bono's wife, Ali Hewson, had some thoughts, Leive said.

""Apparently he turned to his wife and broke the news and she told him, eh, I think you still have some work to do,"" she laughed.

Bono said in a statement Tuesday from Glamour that the battle for gender equality won't be won unless men step up and lead alongside women.

""We're largely responsible for the problem, so we have to be involved in the solutions,"" he said.

Among Glamour's other 2016 honorees are fashion designer Miuccia Prada, IMF chief Christine Lagarde, ISIS kidnap survivor Nadia Murad, Black Lives Matter activists Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, and model and body activist Ashley Graham.

Glamour will feature them all in the December issue. Rounding out the winners:

___

SIMONE BILES: At 19, she has 10 world championship gold medals and five medals from the 2016 Olympics. Since Rio, she's been writing her memoir, ""Courage to Soar,"" out this month.

But it hasn't always been easy. She was in foster care when her biological grandparents adopted her. In 2013, her gymnastics confidence crumbled and with the help of a sports psychologist she learned to trust her talent — and enjoy the ride.

GWEN STEFANI: It's been quite a year for this mom of three. There's her work on ""The Voice,"" her divorce from Gavin Rossdale, her romance with Blake Shelton and her first solo album in a decade, ""This is What the Truth Feels Like,"" which is also her first to debut at No. 1.

""Sometimes to be woken up again in life you need to go through some really bad, hard times,"" she told Glamour. ""I feel like I got woken up this year.""

Leive said of Stefani, ""She's always kind of been like the spirit animal for every girl who just wanted to be herself.""

ZENDAYA: Girls, Leive said, ""love her, they relate to her."" Why? ""Because she stands for a forthright approach to life.""

The former Disney star has more than 33 million followers on Instagram, using her social media presence to support efforts to end hunger and stop the spread of AIDS. At just 20, she is a strong voice against bullying and a positive one in helping girls embrace their own standards of beauty.

""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the person who should be beholding that beauty is you,"" Zendaya told Glamour.

She was propelled further into the spotlight last year after the Oscars when Giuliana Rancic remarked on ""Fashion Police"" that Zendaya's dreadlocks made her look like she smelled of patchouli oil or weed. Rancic later apologized on air.

EMILY DOE: Former Stanford University athlete Brock Turner was convicted of attacking her while she was passed out near a trash bin on campus in January 2015. Turner's six-month prison sentence sparked national outrage and ignited a debate about campus rape and the criminal justice system.

She has chosen to remain anonymous but wrote an essay about the experience that received wide attention. She has written on the subject again in the December issue of Glamour.

""Her voice literally went around the world,"" Leive said. ""Her words and the eloquence of her writing really made everybody stop in their tracks and pay attention.""",01/11/2016
NewsDay,AG: Babylon pharmacist sentenced in HIV drug scam,"A Babylon pharmacist has been sentenced to 8 to 24 years in prison for his role in selling more than $274 million of medically worthless HIV medication, the office of Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said.

Ira Gross, 63, was sentenced in Riverhead Wednesday and ordered to repay what he pocketed in the scheme — $25.2 million, according to a news release.

Evidence at his trial in August revealed that from 2008 to 2012 Gross and others sold the diverted medications, mostly expensive HIV antiretroviral medications purchased off the street, to MOMS Pharmacy in Melville. MOMS Pharmacy then dispensed the diverted medications to thousands of its unsuspecting patients, many of whom were Medicaid recipients, throughout New York and other states, including Massachusetts, Florida, and California, officials said.

Ultimately, the New York Medicaid program paid $154 million for those tainted medications distributed to New York Medicaid patients.

A jury found Gross guilty on Aug. 8 after a four-week trial in Suffolk County Supreme Court before Judge Richard Ambro. He was convicted of first-degree grand larceny, a class B felony, and other related charges.

“The defendant not only cheated the state Medicaid program, but also preyed on some of New York’s most vulnerable so that he could line his own pockets with millions,” Schneiderman said in a statement.

After a long-term investigation, which included the use of court-ordered eavesdropping, in February 2012, the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit stopped in progress a delivery of $1.2 million in diverted medication and executed a search warrant at MOMS Pharmacy’s headquarters in Melville, the release said.

In April 2012, the fraud unit arrested Gross, three others and 10 companies, including Gross’s company Chaparral Services Ltd., after the defendants were indicted by a Suffolk County grand jury.

The attorney general also froze millions of dollars from the defendants in a parallel asset forfeiture action.

Dispensing diverted medications endangers the lives of patients by exposing them to drugs of unknown origin and potency and, in some cases, drugs which were mislabeled or potentially expired, officials said.

In these types of black-market schemes, medications are illegally obtained from a variety of sources, such as drugs bought from patients who sell their meds on the street. The bottles containing diverted medication are then cleaned, often with toxic cleansers, or the diverted medications themselves are rebottled and relabeled using fake labels and serial numbers and stored in unsanitary or uncontrolled conditions before they are illegally sold back into the regulated prescription medication distribution system.

As a result, patients who ingest black market medications may be exposed to potentially adverse drug interactions or serious health consequences, the release said.

Gross also was found guilty of three counts of money laundering, a class B felony, one count of criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions, a class C felony, and other related charges. Chaparral Services Ltd., the shell corporation Gross used to conceal and distribute his criminal proceeds, also was found guilty of three counts of money laundering and other related charges.

Gross, who was licensed to practice pharmacy in 1979, organized the scheme and coordinated the sale of the diverted street medication to MOMS Pharmacy, prosecutors said.

Gross paid Glenn Schabel, the supervising pharmacist and compliance officer for MOMS Pharmacy, more than $5 million to buy medication that he knew or should have known were diverted, according to the release.

Schabel, 55, of Melville, was also arrested and pleaded guilty in September to criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions and commercial bribe receiving.

Schabel was sentenced to 2 to 6 years in state prison and has paid nearly $5.5 million in restitution, the release said. He also was required to surrender his license to practice pharmacy.

Gross, his spouse, Lois Gross of Babylon, and their adult children, Dakota Gross and Chelsea Gross, remain as civil defendants in the attorney general’s forfeiture action, seeking return of the proceeds and substituted proceeds of the criminal scheme that are held in their names. That action continues, the release said.",27/10/2016
NewsDay,"Clinton, Trump face off in final presidential debate","Republican Donald Trump took his tumbling popularity into Wednesday’s final presidential debate needing to score some big points against Democrat Hillary Clinton who, despite Trump’s recent scandals, maintains only a single-digit lead in national polls.

Trump’s decline in the polls began over a week ago after a video was leaked in which he made lewd comments before a 2005 TV appearance about the power of celebrities like himself to grope and kiss women without their consent. Trump responded by saying he will no longer shackled by those who have urged him to transform his shoot-from-the-lip campaign style to a more presidential tenor.

Meanwhile, Clinton is fighting her own high disapproval ratings and more disclosures about her use of a personal email server to handle sensitive material as secretary of state. She has been unable to shut Trump down in national polls or close off his narrow path to a victory in the Electoral College despite accusations of sexual harassment by several women.

The 90-minute debate at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas will be moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, without a break. Wallace will question the candidates on the national debt, tax policy and entitlements in the tax code, immigration, economic policies, their Supreme Court appointments, international issues including the Syrian civil war and refugee crisis, and will close with a discussion on the candidates’ fitness to be president.

Appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court

For the second time, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton refused to shake hands Wednesday to open a presidential debate and then charged into the latest no-holds-barred clash.

The squared off first about how they would shape the U.S. Supreme Court over the next quarter century through two or three appointments.

Clinton called it “the central issue” of the presidential race. She said the Supreme Court can’t stand on the side of the “powerful and the wealthy,” but for women’s rights, gay, lesbian and transgender rights; and against the Citizens United decision that allowed corporations greater latitude in spending in political campaigns.

“The Supreme Court is what it’s all about,” Trump said. “We need a Supreme Court which will uphold the Second Amendment, which is under siege,” he said of the right to bear arms.

He said his justices will be “pro-life,” and will oppose abortion rights, and will have a “conservative bent.”

Gun Rights

Clinton was pressed on her view on guns and said she supports the Constitutional right to own guns, but with “comprehensive background checks.” She said she would close a loophole that allows sales at gun shows with less scrutiny, greater safety measures and sees “no conflict between saving people’s lives and protecting the Second Amendment.”

Trump said she was “very angry” about a gun rights court decision that sought to force greater safety measures on gun owners.

“I was upset, because dozens of toddlers injure themselves and even kill people with guns,” she said. She said 33,000 lives are lost to guns each year.

Trump said tough gun laws _ as in Chicago _ don’t create safer environment.

“We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment,” he said.

Abortion rights

Trump said he will appoint “pro-life justices” and that would allow states to determine their abortion laws. “It will go back to the states,” he said.

“I strongly support Roe v. Wade,” Clinton said. She said many states are already putting “so many restrictions” on women’s access to abortion, including de-funding Planned Parenthood.

“We have come too far to have that turned back now,” she said. “In fact he said women should be punished” for abortion.

“I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those personal decision” even late in pregnancies, Clinton said.

Trump said late-term abortions that Clinton supports is like “ripping” a baby “right out of the womb.”

“Nobody has business doing that....one or two or three days before birth,” he said.

Clinton said those terms are “scare rhetoric [that is] just unfortunate.”

Immigration and deportation

Trump said we need strong borders, citing four mothers in the audience whose children were killed trying to come into the country illegally. He said the association of border patrol agents has endorsed him. He said the drugs coming across the border are “poisoning our youth.”

“I want to build the wall. I want the wall,” Trump said, adding that we need the drug lords to “get out.”

Trump said Clinton wants to give amnesty to undocumented immigrants, which he called unfair to legal immigrants.

“We have no country if we have no borders,” he said, saying Clinton would have open borders, a position Clinton rejects.

Trump said heroin is coming across the borders: “Right now we are getting the drugs, they are getting the cash.”

He said he would deport what could be millions of undocumented immigrants.

“We have some bad hombres here and we are going to get them out,” he said.

Clinton said there are children of illegal immigrants who are born in the U.S. and deportation would split those families apart.

“I don’t want to rip families apart,” Clinton said. “I don’t want to see the deportation force that Donald wants.”

“It’s an idea that is not in keeping with our country, it is an idea that would rip apart our country.”

Clinton said that when Trump met with the Mexican president, he never brought up the proposed wall.

“He choked, then got into a Twitter war,” Clinton said.

Trump said Clinton, as New York’s junior senator, said she was once in favor of a wall. Clinton said she favored comprehensive border security, not a wall.

“Donald knows a lot about this, he used undocumented workers to build the Trump Tower,” she said, then threatened to deport them if they complained.

“We either have a border or we don’t,” he said. “We have millions of people who did it the right way … very unfair for someone to run across the border.”

He said President Barack Obama has deported millions of immigrants with a similar plan, a view Obama has rejected.

Russian espionage

Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News hit Clinton with a WikiLeaks email that said Clinton wanted “open borders.”

Clinton said she was referring to energy, an electric grid that crosses borders.

“What’s really important with WikiLeaks is that he Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans,” Clinton said. “This has come from … Putin himself … to influence our election.”

“I think the most important question of this evening is… does he reject Russian espionage?” she said.

“That was a great pivot from the question of open borders,” Trump shot back. “People are going to be pouring in over the borders … we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.

Trump said he didn’t know Putin. “He has no respect for her, he has no respect for our president,” he said.

Clinton said Trump encouraged espionage against the U.S. in cyber attacks and is “willing to spout the Putin line.” She said Putin “has a very clear favorite in this race” and said it meant a foreign country was trying to influence the election.

Trump said “she has no idea” who was behind the cyber-attacks.

“He’d rather believe Vladimir Putin,” she charged.

“She doesn’t like Putin because he has out-smarted her,” Trump said as both candidates tried to talk over each other. “I don’t know Putin… he’s not my best friend,” but he said it would be good for the United States to have a better relationship with Russia.

“She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anyone I have seen in government,” Trump said of Clinton.

Clinton said there is only four minutes between a president’s order to use nuclear weapons and launches. She said it is “terrifying” that Trump would have that authority and is “cavalier” about using nuclear weapons.

“She has proven she is a liar,” Trump said.

“Well, I’m just quoting you,” she said.

The Economy

Clinton said her plan has been “analyzed by independent experts” and could produce millions of jobs while Trump’s plan would result in job loss that was “trickle-down economics on steroids” that would lead to another recession.

“When the middle class thrives, America thrives,” she said, pushing clean energy to create jobs and combat climate change. She also supports raising the minimum wage to bring people out of poverty and would push for equal pay for women.

She said there would be no tuition cost for public college under her plan.

“Her tax plan is a disaster … a massive, massive tax increase,” he said. He said her college tuition plan would make all Americans pay for more in taxes.

He said he would renegotiate trade deals to “start the engine rolling again because right now, our country is dying.”

Trump named battleground states of Ohio, Michigan and Florida and even upstate New York that need trade deals to be renegotiated to bring jobs back form overseas.

“We are going to start the engine rolling again because our nation is dying,” Trump said.

“I have repeated said I will not raise taxes for anyone making $250,000 or less,” Clintons said. He cited the prosperity during the tenure of her husband, President Bill Clinton, in which taxes were used to “invest” in people to boost the economy.

Clinton, when pressed by Wallace, she said her plan uses elements of President Obama’s economic policy. Wallace noted national economic growth is lower than in decades.

“We’re standing, but we are not yet running,” she said. She said she wants to invest in the middle class through education rather than give tax breaks to wealthy employers.

Wallace noted economists say Trump’s economic plan “just doesn’t add up.”

Trump said India is growing at 8 percent and China is growing at 6 percent, while the U.S. is “at 1 percent and going down.”

He said the jobs report is so bad “I should win the election.”

He decried imports of furniture and other goods from other countries.

Trump said “the one thing” Clinton has over him is experience” but he called it “bad experience.”

Clinton smiled and quietly laughed as Trump criticized her economic plan and her support of trade deals Trump said have cost jobs.

“There is only one of us here who has shipped jobs to Mexico, that’s Donald,” Clinton said. “Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminium .. so he goes around with crocodile tears … but he has given jobs to Chinese steel workers.”

“She’s been doing this for 30 years, why the hell haven’t you done it,” Trump said. “You have experience, but it’s bad experience.”

Trump blamed trade deals that forced him, as a businessman, to buy steel and resources from other countries.

“If you become president this country is going to be in some mess,” Trump said.

Clinton then said her experience included representing poor children, supported women’s rights, and was in the situation room while Osama bin Laden was killed, while Trump was being sued for workers rights’ abuses and hosting a reality TV show, and living off his millionaire father’s money.

Trump said the country would be far better off if it was run as he ran his busineses.

“She gave us ISIS,” he said referring to the terror group that grew after the Iraq war.

Fitness to be president

Asked about the nine women who have claimed Trump groped or kissed them without their consent, Trump said the stories “have been largely debunked” and said they were manufactured by Clinton’s campaign.

“I didn’t know any of these women,” he said, then cited recent disclosures that Democratic operatives had tried to incite violence at Trump rallies.

“It was lies and it was all fiction,” he said of the accusation of sexual assault.

Clinton said at rallies Trump said he would not have done what he was accused of because they were not attractive enough — which Trump denied.

“Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,” she said.

“That’s who Donald is.”

Trump said, “Nobody has more respect for women than I do.”

Clinton said Trump represented a “dangerous” vision of America, that he has created divisiveness in the country that runs contrary to “who we are.”

Asked by Wallace about leaked emails that donors to the Clinton foundation got special treatment, Clinton said the foundation is a “world-renowned charity.” She said the foundation made it possible for 11 million people to afford HIV treatment.

She said there is no evidence of “pay to play.”

Trump said the foundation took donations from countries who mistreat women.

“It’s a criminal enterprise,” Trump interjected.

Clinton said: “I would be happy to compare what we do to what is done with the Trump Foundation.” She noted the Trump Foundation bought a 6-foot portrait of

Trump. “Who does that?” she asked.

Trump said “100 percent” of the Trump Foundation goes to charity.

Wallace notes some of the spending went to pay a settlement for a lawsuit against Trump’s Florida resort.

“There is no way to know this because he hasn’t released his taxes,” Clinton said. “He has not paid a penny in federal income tax.”

“We have undocumented immigrants in this country paying more taxes than a billionaire,” she said.

Trump defended his deductions, saying “most of donors have done the same thing I have done…. You should have changed the law.” He said she won’t change the law because it benefits her Wall Street donors and special interests.

Trump’s claim of a rigged election

Trump refused to take back his claim that the presidential election is “rigged,” even though his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence and other Republicans defend the electoral process.

“I will look at it at the time,” he said of whether he would accept the outcome of the election. “First of all, the media is so corrupt … it’s so dishonest and it poised the minds of the voters.”

“I will tell you at the time I will keep you in suspense,” he said.

“That’s horrifying,” Clinton said, adding that Trump always claims a system is rigged if he loses. She even noted he criticized the Emmy Awards for failing to win an award for his reality TV show.

“I should have gotten it,” he said.

“It’s funny, but it’s really troubling,” she said. “He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy.”

Issues abroad, ISIS, the Syrian civil war

Turning to foreign war zones, the candidates were asked if they would use U.S. troops to combat ISIS, the terror group.

“I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force,” she said. “Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Russians continues.”

She said she would support a no-fly zone in Syria, despite the threat by Russia.

Trump blamed Clinton and Obama for losing hard-fought territory in Iraq.

“Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country,” he said, blaming Clinton and Obama.

Clinton said Trump was for the invasion of Iraq, prompting Trump to say “Wrong,” several times.

“You shouldn’t have been in Iraq, but you voted for it,” Trump said.

“Once again, Donald is implying he wasn’t in favor of the invasion Iraq,” she said.

“Wrong,” he interjected.

“He has not told the truth about that position,” she said, noting she voted for the war and later said it was a mistake. She said she was “going after Osama bin Laden while you were doing ‘Celebrity Apprentice.’”

They then spoke over each other.

“He is unfit,” she said.

“No, she is unfit,” Trump countered.

“You are the most dangerous person to run for country in the modern history of America,” Clinton told Trump, echoing what has been said by her former Democratic primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Wallace said Trump has made several untruthful statements about foreign affairs involving Aleppo, the Syrian hot spot, which Trump once said had fallen. It has not.

Trump said the Obama administration “doesn’t know who the rebels are” and that removing the Assad administration in Syria could give rise to an even more dangerous despot.

“Lots of luck, Hillary, thanks a lot of doing a great job!” Trump said sarcastically, as Clinton laughed at his comment.

“I think we could strike a deal” with Russians for a no-fly zone to aid refugees, she said in defending her plan for a no-fly zone over Syria.

Trump, citing the recent ceasefire, said Russia used to time to claim territory. “Our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad...no one can believe how stupid our leadership is.”

“I will defeat ISIS,” she said.

“It’s so ridiculous,” Trump said, blaming the rise of ISIS to her poor foreign policy as secretary of state.

The national debt

The moderator accused each candidate of ignoring the nation debt and having plans to incur more debt.

Trump said his policies will heat up the economy to create more wealth and reduce the national debt.

“We have people who are political hacks making these (trade) deals,” he said.

“When I hear Donald talk like that and her his slogan of ‘Make America Great Again’ I wonder when he thought America was great,” she said. “He has been criticizing our country for decades.”

She said he attacked Republican President Ronald Reagan for poor trade deals and economic policies, too. “We are going task the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.. we have to get back to rebuilding the middle class. That’s where growth will come from.”

He said that because he “got money from his Dad” he sees the economy differently.

“We’ve heard that,” Trump said dismissively.

Clinton said, “I pay for everything I am proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt....we are going to ask the wealthy and the corporations to pay their fair share.”

Trump said he would repeal Obamacare. “Bad health care, at the most expensive price.”

Trump said he would cut taxes and grow the economy to better fund Medicare and Social Security and save the entitlement programs. He also said repealing Obamacare will save money that can be used to boost Medicare.

“She wants to keep Obamacare and wants to make it even worse and it can’t get any worse,” he said.

Clinton said she would use more taxes on the wealthy _ “including Donald unless he finds a way to get out of it” – to save Medicare and Social Security without cutting benefits.

Trump interjected that she was “nasty.”

Closing statements

The moderator asked the candidates to make impromptu closing statements, when no time was allotted for it in the schedule.

“I am reaching out to all Americans … because we need everyone to make our country what it ought to be, to be fairer for everyone,” she said. “I will stand up for families, against corporations.”

“She’s raising the money from the people she wants to control, it doesn’t work,” Trump retorted. He said he would fix a “depleted military” and serve veterans and police.

“Our inner cities are a disaster,” he said. “I will do more for African Americans and Latinos that she could do in 10 lifetimes.”

“We can make America great again and we have to start now,” he said. “We can’t have four more years of Obama that’s what you will get with her.”

“I should have gotten it,” he said.

“It’s funny, but it’s really troubling,” she said. “He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy.”

Issues abroad, ISIS, the Syrian civil war

Turning to foreign war zones, the candidates were asked if they would use U.S. troops to combat ISIS, the terror group.

“I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force,” she said. “Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Russians continues.”

She said she would support a no-fly zone in Syria, despite the threat by Russia.

Trump blamed Clinton and Obama for losing hard-fought territory in Iraq.

“Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country,” he said, blaming Clinton and Obama.

Clinton said Trump was for the invasion of Iraq, prompting Trump to say “Wrong,” several times.

“You shouldn’t have been in Iraq, but you voted for it,” Trump said.

“Once again, Donald is implying he wasn’t in favor of the invasion Iraq,” she said.

“Wrong,” he interjected.

“He has not told the truth about that position,” she said, noting she voted for the war and later said it was a mistake. She said she was “going after Osama bin Laden while you were doing ‘Celebrity Apprentice.’”

They then spoke over each other.

“He is unfit,” she said.

“No, she is unfit,” Trump countered.

“You are the most dangerous person to run for country in the modern history of America,” Clinton told Trump, echoing what has been said by her former Democratic primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Wallace said Trump has made several untruthful statements about foreign affairs involving Aleppo, the Syrian hot spot, which Trump once said had fallen. It has not.

Trump said the Obama administration “doesn’t know who the rebels are” and that removing the Assad administration in Syria could give rise to an even more dangerous despot.

“Lots of luck, Hillary, thanks a lot of doing a great job!” Trump said sarcastically, as Clinton laughed at his comment.

“I think we could strike a deal” with Russians for a no-fly zone to aid refugees, she said in defending her plan for a no-fly zone over Syria.

Trump, citing the recent ceasefire, said Russia used to time to claim territory. “Our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad...no one can believe how stupid our leadership is.”

“I will defeat ISIS,” she said.

“It’s so ridiculous,” Trump said, blaming the rise of ISIS to her poor foreign policy as secretary of state.

The national debt

The moderator accused each candidate of ignoring the nation debt and having plans to incur more debt.

Trump said his policies will heat up the economy to create more wealth and reduce the national debt.

“We have people who are political hacks making these (trade) deals,” he said.

“When I hear Donald talk like that and her his slogan of ‘Make America Great Again’ I wonder when he thought America was great,” she said. “He has been criticizing our country for decades.”

She said he attacked Republican President Ronald Reagan for poor trade deals and economic policies, too. “We are going task the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.. we have to get back to rebuilding the middle class. That’s where growth will come from.”

He said that because he “got money from his Dad” he sees the economy differently.

“We’ve heard that,” Trump said dismissively.

Clinton said, “I pay for everything I am proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt....we are going to ask the wealthy and the corporations to pay their fair share.”

Trump said he would repeal Obamacare. “Bad health care, at the most expensive price.”

Trump said he would cut taxes and grow the economy to better fund Medicare and Social Security and save the entitlement programs. He also said repealing Obamacare will save money that can be used to boost Medicare.

“She wants to keep Obamacare and wants to make it even worse and it can’t get any worse,” he said.

Clinton said she would use more taxes on the wealthy _ “including Donald unless he finds a way to get out of it” – to save Medicare and Social Security without cutting benefits.

Trump interjected that she was “nasty.”

Closing statements

The moderator asked the candidates to make impromptu closing statements, when no time was allotted for it in the schedule.

“I am reaching out to all Americans … because we need everyone to make our country what it ought to be, to be fairer for everyone,” she said. “I will stand up for families, against corporations.”

“She’s raising the money from the people she wants to control, it doesn’t work,” Trump retorted. He said he would fix a “depleted military” and serve veterans and police.

“Our inner cities are a disaster,” he said. “I will do more for African Americans and Latinos that she could do in 10 lifetimes.”

“We can make America great again and we have to start now,” he said. “We can’t have four more years of Obama that’s what you will get with her.”

NewsDay,100 years of Planned Parenthood celebrated at NYC City Hall,"Dozens of supporters, including numerous Democratic candidates at national and local levels, celebrated 100 years of Planned Parenthood on Sunday, telling tales of its impact on them and promising continued support.

Sen. Chuck Schumer said the agency, which advocates for women’s health care, including the right to choose an abortion, will always receive government funding under Democratic leadership.

“Planned Parenthood on our watch will not be attacked or held political hostage and it will never be defunded when the Democrats get to political office . . . and when we have our first woman president,” said Schumer (D-N.Y), who is running for re-election against Republican attorney Wendy Long and two third-party candidates.

Long’s campaign had no response Sunday night to Schumer’s statements.

Schumer was one of a dozen Democratic officials who declared their support for Planned Parenthood after first telling personal stories that were cheered by dozens of health care providers, volunteers and leaders in the rotunda of New York City Hall.

Among those cheering were was Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation, and founder Margaret Sanger’s grandson Alex Sanger, who continues to lead the group’s international clinics in Iraq, Syria and Haiti.

“We are on the same side,” said Schumer, who explained Planned Parenthood “is helping us in our races so we can get a majority in the Senate and a good Supreme Court that will never turn its back on Roe v. Wade.”

At the organization’s inception in a storefront clinic in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Margaret Sanger, the daughter of immigrants who became a nurse, gave women pamphlets on how to prevent pregnancy. Police immediately shut down the clinic and jailed Sanger. Now, more than 64,000 New Yorkers each year receive gynecological care, contraception, pregnancy testing, abortions and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV testing and counseling. There are approximately 650 clinics nationwide.

“My grandmother Margaret Sanger saw how the lives of women were stunted by unwanted pregnancies and she said ‘enough is enough,’ ” Alex Sanger said to the cheering crowd.

“She put out this little flier in Yiddish, Italian and English along with a 16-page pamphlet with methods of birth control and revolutionized the idea that women should have a choice and should be treated equally.”

Assemb. Latrice Walker (D-Brooklyn), said she was a patient of Planned Parenthood when she was a young woman and faced an unwanted pregnancy. “The abortion did not take my ability to reproduce and so many thousands have had the same experience and have come out of those shadows to say we have made these decisions for the best interests of ourselves.”

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the keynote speaker, told the crowd how, as a young man before entering law school, he worked for Planned Parenthood in Washington, D.C. He said he would meet women from Southern states at the airport who had flown to Washington to obtain abortions, “desperate to control their bodies.”

He said the experience showed him “the right to an abortion is freedom.”",16/10/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics wins $600G grant for TB test for cattle,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has won a $600,000 federal grant to develop a rapid test for tuberculosis in cattle, executives said Monday.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV, Ebola, Zika and other diseases in humans will work with the National Animal Disease Center and Infectious Disease Research Institute on the new test.

The grant money is for two years and comes from the Small Business Innovation Research Program within the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, a federal agency. NIFA is part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Chembio CEO John J. Sperzel said the blood test for bovine tuberculosis would provide results in 20 minutes, compared with skin tests now in use that take days. He said the test could be used with beef and dairy herds.

More than a million cattle are tested in the United States each year, including at slaughterhouses.

“While worldwide bovine TB cost estimates vary, Europe’s highest incidence occurs in England, where the annual cost associated with bovine TB is estimated at 100 million pounds” (about $112 million), he said.

Sperzel also said that while Chembio is best known for HIV tests, the company has developed a tuberculosis test for captive and farmed deer.

NewsDay,"Rampant speculation about Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie breakup a sad commentary on our celebrity obsession","Allow me to preface this column by acknowledging there are far more pressing concerns than Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s pending divorce.

Their pain is nothing compared to that of, say, Nadia Murad, who was sold as a sex slave to an ISIS commander and is now suing the terrorist group on behalf of thousands of its victims.

Their heartbreak doesn’t equal that of Syrian refugees who can protect neither their homeland nor their children.

Their split won’t leave either of them penniless or, in all likelihood, companionless. They will be fine.

And yet .

News of Jolie filing for divorce from Pitt, her mate of 12 years and her husband of two, reverberated fast and furious. More so than Justin Bieber and model Sofia Richie, whose split was also announced this week. More so than Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston, who parted ways this month.

More so, I’d venture to guess, than almost any celebrity couple whose love affair we watched take root and grow into what appeared to be a loving union of equals.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

That’s partly because they lasted more than a decade - a rare feat in Hollywood. But it’s also because of who they are apart from Hollywood.

Earlier this month, Jolie, a United Nations envoy, appeared at a UN peacekeeping summit, where she spoke to delegates from 80 countries about the organization’s alleged sexual abuse by peacekeepers. She is an outspoken advocate for Syrian refugees and visited with many of them as recently as March.

In 2013, she went public with her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy, hoping her frank discussion would encourage other women to determine their risk for breast and ovarian cancer.

They have raised adopted children from Cambodia, Vietnam and Ethiopia. Together they formed the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which is reported to have given money to Doctors Without Borders, an Ethiopian HIV clinic and Pakistani refugees, among others.

Brad Pitt’s Make It Right organization builds LEED-certified homes for people in need, including those in New Orleans displaced by Hurricane Katrina.

But we need one of them to be a villain.

They’re splitting up, and we need to decide which one to blame, so Tuesday began the speculating about who’s a bad parent, who smokes a lot of pot, who’s having an affair with a co-star and so on.

I’m going to suggest something a little radical: It doesn’t matter.

No one knows the truth of another person’s marriage. Heck, a lot of us don’t know the whole truth of our own.

What we do know is Jolie and Pitt have taken their wealth and privilege and fame and pointed it toward improving the world. That’s worthy of our respect. Whatever they do inside or outside of their marriage doesn’t have to diminish that respect. It really doesn’t.

I bring this up not because I feel protective of a millionaire power couple I’ve never met. As I acknowledged earlier: They’ll be fine.

I bring it up because we’ve gotten way too adept at shutting off our humanity toward people we don’t know. We’re too quick to dismiss people as flawed and, therefore, unworthy of our grace; unrelatable and, therefore, unworthy of our empathy; unknowable and, therefore, unworthy of our energy.

I’ve been through a divorce. The way we talk about celebrities who split up isn’t all that different from the way we talk about couples we know - even those we know intimately. We want details and we want to pick sides. We pry and speculate and take those a-little-too-gleeful conversations where they don’t belong - namely, behind the divorcing couple’s back.

It’s not helpful. It turns people into one half of a severed union, instead of, you know, people.

When “Love Warrior” author Glennon Doyle Melton announced her pending divorce on her Momastery blog, she attached a P.S. that was, in my eyes, one of her most powerful posts.

“Try to avoid lamenting how sad it is that people ’throw away their marriages these days,’” she wrote. “Try not to generalize. I have met hundreds of divorced women who didn’t throw their marriages away. Most of us fight like hell for our marriages until we realize that we can either save our marriages or save our souls.

“Please don’t pretend to know what God thinks of us,” she continued. “Please think deeply about the chasm-wide difference between leaving a man and leaving God. Please remember that when a woman leaves, she just brings God with her. Nothing separates a woman or a family from God’s love. Not death, and certainly not divorce.

“Sometimes,” she wrote, “when people make decisions about marriage, it evokes strong feelings in others. If my news does that to you today, please look inside and get curious about whether those feelings have more to do with you and your life than they do about me and mine.”

Pitt and Jolie’s divorce - and our handling of it - is hardly our most pressing concern. If I were making a Most Pressing Concerns list, it wouldn’t even make the top 100. But it’s a chance to examine and practice how we treat the people around us, particularly those whose marriages end.

We can do better.

NewsDay,"Melville pharmacist sold black market meds, took bribes, AG says","A former pharmacist from Melville was sentenced Tuesday to 2 to 6 years in prison for selling black market prescription medications to unsuspecting HIV-positive New Yorkers and taking more than $5 million in bribes, the state attorney general’s office said.

Glenn Schabel, 55, will also have to pay back $5,456,267 to the state’s Medicaid program, having pleaded guilty in March to first-degree criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions, and first-degree commercial bribe receiving, both felonies, authorities said. He also had to surrender his pharmacist license, they said.

His attorney did not immediately return calls Tuesday night.

Schabel and three others were arrested in April 2012, accused of using a network of bogus prescription medication wholesalers in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina and California to launder money and sell more than $274 million in diverted prescription medications.

He had been the supervising pharmacist and compliance officer for MOMS Pharmacy, which was reimbursed $150 million from Medicaid for HIV drugs that were illegally obtained through the black market, according to state Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman.

“This scheme not only defrauded Medicaid but created a serious public health threat to many New Yorkers,” Schneiderman said in a news release. “We won’t allow vulnerable individuals to be taken advantage of by criminals looking to make a quick buck.”

Ten companies were charged and 10 drugs were involved, including Truvada, Atripla and Reyataz. All are listed by the Food and Drug Administration as commonly prescribed HIV treatments. The medications were obtained between 2008 to 2012 from illegal or unknown sources, moved through Allion Healthcare Inc., the parent company of MOMS Pharmacy, which purchased the drugs, Schneiderman had said.

NewsDay,Suffolk pols criticize proposed cut in smoking cessation program,"Suffolk lawmakers criticized a cut proposed in Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone’s budget to end a tobacco cessation program, saying it could lead to higher smoking rates and health care costs.

The budget eliminates the 15 positions in the county’s Office of Public Health and moves the jobs to other departments. Programs run by the county in high schools to prevent tobacco use, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and bullying would continue, as would enforcement of tobacco laws, county spokeswoman Vanessa Baird-Streeter said.

The tobacco cessation program, which would end, has served 404 new participants this year. That’s down from 862 in 2015 and 915 in 2014 as the county offered fewer sessions because of a staff member who has been on medical leave, county officials said.

Legis. William Spencer (D-Centerport) said cutting programs that prevent disease would lead to higher costs as electronic cigarettes become more popular.

“It’s a very scary prospect given the impacts of smoking over the last 50 years and what a devastating toll it has taken on our economy and the cost of medical care,” said Spencer, a medical doctor and chair of the county’s health committee.

Legis. Sarah Anker (D-Mount Sinai), said she also opposed the cut. “Those programs should not be eliminated. They will ultimately save money and ultimately save lives,” she said.

Baird-Streeter said the county “is exercising tight controls on spending.”

While the program has served more than 18,000 residents since 2000, participation is going down. “We have continued to see a decrease in participants since the program’s inception,” she said.

The smoking cessation program was initially funded in 2000 as part of a settlement with tobacco companies, but previous administrations have used that funding stream to plug past budget holes.

Bellone released his $2.96 billion budget for 2017 on Friday, calling it “tight but fair.” It contains no layoffs. It also includes a nearly 4 percent increase in property taxes to pay for police, borrowing $60 million over two years to pay for police exit pay and a new $300 fee on mortgages.

Bellone said last week that the county had to evaluate all programs not mandated by state or federal authorities. The county has been hurt by rising personnel costs and stagnant sales tax growth, which has come in far below what the county projected.

County lawmakers will now review the budget in closed-door workshops and vote on it in November.

Anker said she would fight to preserve the tobacco cessation program.

Republican lawmakers have complained the budget relies too much on one-time revenue generators, including borrowing for pension costs and police retirement pay, and higher fees.",19/09/2016
NewsDay,Javier Muñoz on becoming Alexander Hamilton in ‘Hamilton’,"Playing Alexander Hamilton is nothing new for Javier Muñoz — he’s performed the title role in the megahit musical since its start Off-Broadway at the Public Theater in 2015. But that was only once a week, when he alternated with the show’s creator (and his friend), Lin-Manuel Miranda. When Miranda left the show in July, Muñoz inherited the role full-time, receiving critical acclaim in the process.

For Muñoz, 40, a native of Brooklyn’s East New York section and graduate of New York University, history is repeating itself. The same basic thing went down when he starred in Miranda’s first musical, “In the Heights.” But in his time playing Hamilton he’s experienced higher ups (performing for President Barack Obama) and lower downs (being diagnosed with cancer last year and having to take several weeks off for treatment).

He’s endured health scares before (the actor is HIV positive) but his cancer recovery makes playing the role now all the sweeter, he says.

So what’s it like to finally have Hamilton be yours completely? You’re not Robin anymore — now you get to be Batman.

Yeah. [He laughs.] It wasn’t till the middle of our first year when I thought . . . OK, I’m in good shape. I know what I’m doing. Now, to finally be doing the show . . . night to night . . . is beyond rewarding. And given my own personal journey to get here . . . it’s gratifying, to know I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. That feeling . . . that’s immense. And beyond my ability to wrap my brain around. But it’s how I feel.

In the show, it’s Hamilton vs. Burr. But is there anything Burr says or advises that you, personally, agree with?

Sign up for Newsday's Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs, TV and more. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Yes. In fact, when the show was being developed, I kept finding myself gravitating to Burr’s arc. It’s something I’d love to explore in the future.

You mean you’d like to play Burr sometime?

Absolutely. Should that opportunity arise. But it’s useful to have those moments where I agree with Burr, because Hamilton sought Burr out. He thought he could learn from Burr. Then . . . Washington, the man of the period, takes Hamilton in and makes him his right-hand man. That’s the turning point. That’s when Hamilton starts to have that overconfidence and conflicts start to arise.

I hear you’ve got a green thumb. Where’d that come from?

That’s mom.

Tell me about this garden you’ve got going at the theater.

It’s on the marquee . . . above the box office. We can sit out there. The garden is . . . my solace. After my cancer treatment, I was so restless. My endurance had returned — but I had this energy that needed to go into something other than the show. I needed nourishing of some kind. I considered meditation, but I already do that in the mornings.

Really. I’ve been thinking of trying that.

I highly recommend it. It brings everything into focus, then I’m ready for whatever the day is going to bring. So I briefly considered more meditation. But . . . seeds were delivered from Monticello. I picked up a bunch thinking I’d grow them in my apartment. My mother can look at a seed and it’ll grow. It’s ridiculous. Then I thought, well, maybe at the theater. I wanted to nurture something. I don’t have children, I don’t have a pet. Gardening just made sense. I’ve tried to make it so the cast and crew can enjoy it at any time. I’ll peek out there and I’ll see our sound department guys or the ushers hanging out by the garden. I’ve told them a million times, I’ll go to hell and back for these people. They lifted me up when I needed it.

Good for you, by the way, on your recovery. I suppose your morning meditation helped, relieving stress and all that.

Yeah. Someone recommended a simple, introductory meditation, A compassion meditation, and the exercise was very much a fake-it-till-you-make-it kind of thing. I couldn’t sit still for longer than five seconds. First you find a breathing rhythm, then you repeat these sentences in your mind. One day it lasted 30 seconds, the next maybe 35, the next week maybe a minute . . . I just let myself ebb and flow, and if it didn’t work some mornings, fine. It’ll work tomorrow. It’s hard in our day and age to shut out the cellphone and social media, the news, music and all those messages we get all freakin’ day long. It’s difficult to ask yourself to stop swimming in the pool and just . . . float. It took a good year before I got up to 10 to 15 minutes. Now my meditation is 30 to 45 minutes.

OK, so if I try it, you’re saying, “Don’t rush it.”

Yeah, it took me years.",12/09/2016
NewsDay,"Brandon Marshall backs Colin Kaepernick, criticizes Boomer Esiason","Brandon Marshall took radio host Boomer Esiason to task, calling the former NFL quarterback “100 percent wrong” for his negative response to the national anthem protest by 49ers backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

“This guy, he is one of the biggest patriots out there. Because he’s standing up for human rights,” the Jets’ receiver said Tuesday on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton.”

Marshall made it clear that he’ll be standing for the anthem before the Jets’ regular-season opener against the Bengals Sunday, also the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But he also defended Kaepernick’s right to peacefully protest police brutality, specifically against African-Americans, and the systematic oppression of people of color.

“The only thing that I would love for everyone to really think about is: What does the American flag mean to them?” Marshall asked, hours before he and Esiason were set to discuss the issue on their weekly television gig, Showtime’s “Inside the NFL.”

“When I look at the American flag, I see a bunch of fights. You know how much we have overcome. When you look at it, the American flag is bigger than just one thing. And you have the civil rights movement, you have sex trafficking, you have immigration law. There’s so many different fights there. And we have to be aware that it’s bigger than one person and one thing.

“But then there are times when that one thing trumps all. When it comes to human rights, we really have to be careful. If you believe in one thing, if you believe in mental health, then that means you believe in cancer research. If you believe in cancer research, then you believe in raising awareness for HIV. If you believe in standing up for gay rights, then you believe in standing up for the minorities.”

In an exclusive interview with Newsday last week, Esiason ripped Kaepernick’s decision not to stand for the anthem at a preseason game as “an embarrassment” and “about as disrespectful as any athlete has ever been.”

The reactions to Esiason’s comments were strong and swift on Twitter, with some agreeing and others disagreeing.

“This conversation is happening in every locker room across America and also across the world,” said Marshall, adding that he and his teammates have talked about it. “This is a huge topic and I’m glad that it’s being had.

“I think President Obama said it best — that’s his constitutional right. That was Colin’s right and that’s all the other guys’ right. But I do think this is very thought-provoking for all. I think that the message was a little diluted because of how much respect a lot of us have for those that served . . . (they) gave us our freedoms, fought for our freedoms. But the message was clear.”",06/09/2016

NewsDay,Letter: Why schools should teach mental health,"Mental illness affects 1 out of 5 people at some point in their lives, so it is sad that students can go through 12 years of school and learn nothing about mental disorders [“Cuomo must sign bill on mental health instruction,” Editorial, Aug. 19].

However, that should change. All that’s needed is for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to sign a bill to require public schools to incorporate mental health instruction into health class curricula.

The law would add the words “mental health” to the requirements. Health education is already a required part of the school curriculum and includes HIV/AIDS, substance abuse and sex education. In fact, students cannot graduate without knowing how to do breast or testicular self-examinations.

But teaching about mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder is neglected in our schools — despite the fact that mental illness can dramatically affect the ability of so many of our young people to succeed in school and life. Untreated mental illness has a devastating long-term effect on society.

NewsDay,Roger Tsien dead; exuberant Nobel Prize-winning chemist was 64,"SAN DIEGO — Roger Tsien, the exuberant and resourceful University of California, San Diego researcher who shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry for helping to find a more effective way to peer inside cells and organisms, died on Aug. 24. He was 64.

Tsien died while in Eugene, Ore., said UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, who broke the news to the campus community Wednesday. The precise cause of death has yet to be determined.

Tsien, a first-generation American who began to explore chemistry at age 8, was hailed for “illuminating” the study of such diseases as cancer and HIV. He teamed with fellow scientists Osamu Shimomura and Martin Chalfie to turn green fluorescent protein, or GFP, which is found in jellyfish, into a research tool.

Khosla recalled the collaboration, saying in a statement: “Shimomura identified the crucial jellyfish protein and revealed that it glowed bright green under ultraviolet light. Chalfie showed how it could be used as a biological marker. Combining his deep skills in chemistry and biology, Tsien found ways to make GFP glow more brightly and consistently; then he created a full palette of fluorescent proteins that scientists could use to track different cellular processes at the same time.

“GFPs have become a fundamental fixture in life sciences labs around the world, allowing researchers to look into cells or whole animals, to watch molecules interact in real-time and ask questions once thought impossible.”

After winning the Nobel in 2008, Tsien told The San Diego Union-Tribune, “I’ve always been attracted to colors. Color helps make the work more interesting and endurable. It helps when things aren’t going well. If I had been born color-blind, I probably never would have gone into this.”

The news of Tsien’s death caused mourning across the Torrey Pines Mesa in the San Diego community of La Jolla, home to one of the nation’s largest life-science clusters.

“Roger Tsien was truly one of the most remarkable and inspiring scientists of our time,” says Elizabeth Blackburn, a Nobel laureate and president of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla.

“He will be sorely missed as a colleague for his revolutionary work and keen mind, and also as a wonderful person. I felt privileged to get to know him over the years.”

Nobel laureate K. Barry Sharpless of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, said, “Rarely are the smartest people the most creative, too - but Roger was both.”

Kristiina Vuori, president of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, said, “The mesa is a little darker with the passing of Nobel laureate Roger Tsien. His death is a huge loss to the scientific world. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues and we will continue to be inspired by the remarkable scientific discoveries he made through the years.”

Bioluminescence researcher Nathan Shaner, who studied in Tsien’s lab, said he was struggling with shock and disbelief.

“He gave me a huge opportunity,” said Shaner, a founding investigator of the nonprofit Scintillon Institute for Biomedical and Bioenergy Research in Sorrento Valley.

“He was the smartest person I’ve ever met, the most creative, and he was also incredibly humble about his place in the big picture,” Shaner said.

Shaner said Tsien gave students great freedom to pursue their projects. He would frequently ask for updates on their progress, but otherwise remain in the background.

“He was very good about letting us figure things out for ourselves,” Shaner said. “I really learned to be independent.”

Shaner and colleagues put green fluorescent protein to artistic use by using genetically engineered bacteria to draw a multicolored San Diego beach scene. Other scientists have adopted this new artistic medium.

Roger Yonchien Tsien was born in New York City on Feb., 1, 1952. His father, Hsue Chu, was an engineer. His mother, Yi Ying Li, trained as a nurse.

His father found various jobs, but those early years weren’t easy. Roger Tsien wrote in his Nobel biography that the family “chose a new housing development in Livingston, N.J., but the developer refused to sell to us, saying that they could not permit Livingston to become a Chinatown, nor could they afford the likelihood that other customers would refuse to buy houses next to a Chinese family.

“My parents appealed to the governor of New Jersey, Robert Meyner. His office sent a letter to the developers warning them that racial discrimination was illegal.”

Roger Tsien prospered as a student, and was awarded first prize in the 1968 Westinghouse Science Talent Search for high school seniors.

“I remember being envious of my fellow finalists, who were much more adult and sophisticated,” Tsien wrote in his bio. “Also their projects and exhibits seemed much more exciting and explainable than mine. I felt intimidated by the senior judge, Glenn Seaborg, partly because of his commanding height, partly because he was chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, partly because of his 1951 Nobel Prize for work in inorganic chemistry.”

Tsien went on to study chemistry and physics at Harvard College, and later earned a doctorate in physiology at the University of Cambridge in England. He became a junior professor at UC Berkeley before landing at his permanent home, UC San Diego, in 1989.

Tsien earned many professional honors, including being elected to the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.

He was also known for and sticking hard and fast to the facts of science. This side of his personality surfaced in front of 400 people in 2013 at the Salk, when Tsien got into an argument with Nobel laureate James Watson during a public lecture.

Tsien didn’t agree with what Watson was saying about oxidants and antioxidants and stood to offer a different perspective. Watson tried to blow him off and dismissively said, “All you have to do is think clearly and these difficulties vanish.”

Tsien calmly replied by telling the agitated Watson that he could find the real facts of the matter by cracking open a particular book. They traded sour looks before a Salk professor stepped in to restore order.

Tsien made light of the situation as he left the auditorium, telling the Union-Tribune: “You should take all elderly scientists with a grain of salt -- including me.”",02/09/2016
NewsDay,"Younger millennials more ‘sexually inactive,’ study reports","The “hookup generation” has been renamed the “meh-lennial” generation. At least when it comes to sex.

Despite popular dating apps like Tinder, new research says that millennials are not living up to their hookup generation stereotype. A study published this month in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior found that millennials have better things to do than hit the sheets with a romantic partner.

The scientific data seems to overturn the notion of a generation actively participating in casual sex.

In fact, millennials are twice as likely to be “sexually inactive” compared with people who were born in the 1960s (the tail end of the boomers) and ’70s (GenX’ers) when they were the same age. Only people born in the 1920s reported having less sex.

Combining the work of three American universities, the study analyzed data from the General Social Survey, which polls U.S. adults about their sex habits. The research found that younger millennials — born in the 1990s — admitting to having no sexual partners after the age of 18 has shot up to 15 percent, vs. 12 percent of young adults born in the 1970s or ’80s. Just 6 percent of those born in the ’60s said they had no sexual partners.

How can this be true?

Researchers can only speculate. Their possible reasons include: more sex education and awareness of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV; easy access to pornography; and generational differences in definitions of what sex is and isn’t — for example, oral sex vs. intercourse.

And yes, it turns out texting could be partly to blame. Some researchers attribute the higher level of sexual inactivity among millennials to an increasing use of personal technology.",26/08/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics wins $13M contract toward Zika test,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has won a U.S. government contract valued at up to $13.2 million for further development of its rapid test for the Zika virus, executives said yesterday.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV and syphilis said $5.9 million of the federal Department of Health and Human Services funding would go toward its Zika test and a companion results reader.

The $7.3 million balance of the contract will be used for development of a combination test for Zika, chikungunya and dengue.

CEO John J. Sperzel said the federal money “will allow the company to further develop the DPP Zika IgM/IgG assays, complete key clinical trials and complete important U.S. regulatory submissions.”

Last month, Chembio received approval to sell the Zika test in Europe and the Caribbean.

The company also has been seeking regulatory approval to introduce the test in Brazil, where many people have been affected by the disease.

Chembio’s prior Zika work was supported by grants from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. Allen is a co-founder of computer software giant Microsoft.

Zika is spread by mosquitoes and was first identified in 1947.

Recently, outbreaks of the virus in French Polynesia and Brazil have been tentatively linked with women giving birth to babies with microcephaly — unusually small heads — and brain damage. There also has been a handful of cases in the United States, including in New York City and Florida.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics to sell rapid tests in Caribbean,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Thursday announced an agreement to sell its rapid tests for HIV, syphilis and the Zika virus in the Caribbean.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests said its products would be sold exclusively by distributor Isla Lab Caribbean in 25 countries and territories, excluding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The agreement also includes future Chembio tests — which are pending regulatory approval or are in development — for chikungunya, dengue and several that cover multiple diseases in a single test.

“We are thrilled to expand the availability of our products through this exclusive distribution agreement with Isla Lab Caribbean, the largest diagnostics distributor in the Caribbean,” Chembio CEO John J.

NewsDay,Two ways to improve inmate health in Nassau,"As public health experts in correctional health, including health education, we are deeply concerned about the recent string of deaths at the Nassau County Correctional Center.

Incarcerated populations have higher rates of mental illness, chronic medical conditions, and infectious diseases compared with the general population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research also demonstrates that access to health care and the quality of that care in jails are often deficient. What’s more, many formerly incarcerated people are unable to manage health conditions after they are released.

This should concern not only inmates but also correction staff and Nassau County residents. There are many factors contributing to the state of inmate health at the jail, and our purpose is not to assign blame. And as tragic as the deaths at the jail are, they present us with an opportunity to focus on how we can best address the long-term health concerns at the jail.

We urge all Nassau County agencies responsible for the well-being of inmates at the beleaguered jail to consider a more comprehensive public health approach to how they provide health, mental health, social services and disease prevention programs not only for those incarcerated but also those formerly at the jail who are re-entering communities on Long Island.

We propose two approaches:

First, too often correctional health focuses on immediate medical and clinical issues and not on disease prevention and health promotion. To improve the quality of jail health care, we suggest following guidelines established through the CDC and other proven approaches to correctional health. Public health initiatives, such as increasing awareness of communicable diseases (HIV and other sexually transmitted infections) and promoting healthy behaviors (prenatal and infant care), have been successful in jails. Also, correctional facilities have been useful for substance abuse intervention, rehabilitation and control.

Second, we propose additional training for jail staff about the health conditions (mental health, substance abuse, untreated chronic health conditions, trauma, etc.) of inmates before they enter the jail. Understanding the inmate population’s health needs and how they impact health care would allow staff to anticipate problems.

Incarcerated persons in Nassau County and in the United States experience health disparities and barriers to accessing health and social service programs, thus perpetuating recidivism.

NewsDay,Billy Bean says Pride Night at Citi Field is about being welcoming and supportive,"What would young Billy Bean have made of his team hosting a Pride Night when he was a major league player in the late 1980s and early 1990s?

First of all, the concept would not have occurred to him. But if it had existed, it would have meant the world to him.

“It would have been a life-changing experience for me to walk out to the ballpark and see my employer – the Padres, the Dodgers or the Tigers – making a statement,” he said. “I couldn’t even imagine telling my own family at that time.”

Times have changed. Bean, now 52, is two years into a role with Major League Baseball that expanded in January along with an expanded title: vice president of social responsibility and inclusion.

And more and more teams are scheduling events such as Pride Night, including the Mets’ inaugural version Saturday night against the Padres.

Bean, one of only two openly gay major league players on record – neither of whom came out publicly while active – said part of the idea is to send a message to everyone in the community, from players to fans.

“I think whether we have players coming out or not, or whether that’s not going to happen for a while,” he said, “at least we’re creating an environment where employees of major league clubs, fans, players, the minor leaguers, are going to hear about the game and say, ‘Wow, look at the Mets; everybody is welcome.’”

Subscribe to Newsday’s sports newsletter Receive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

About 5,000 fans are expected to participate by accessing three discounted seating areas, with a portion of those proceeds benefitting the LGBT Network and its Safe Schools Initiative to stop bullying on Long Island and in Queens.

Bean said more and more teams are adding such events after “seeing there’s really no downside to dedicating one day over the course of the season to another part of the diversity spectrum of their fans.”

Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of sexual orientation, he said.

“It’s really just being supportive of the message,” Bean said. “It’s the same for players. It really should not be of importance what a person’s private life is as a player. It’s really: Are they going to be a role model? What do they stand for? If they’re asked a question do they want to be an accepting role model or do they want to divide?

“I think a player has to make that decision for themselves. We’ve seen players go both ways in those decisions and at the end of the day they’re grown adults and they have to make those decisions for themselves.”

Part of Bean’s mission is to help wary players see the light when it comes to acceptance, something that at times can be a challenge even in a relatively enlightened era.

“There was no real definition of the job, so there was a little uncertainty and excitement and fear and nervousness and anxiety,” Bean said. “To bring a conversation that’s never happened before in front of the players especially, that was a huge challenge and it was one that I took very seriously.

“I think what gave me the confidence was that Commissioner [Rob] Manfred and the gentlemen and women that hired me assured me that because the message was coming from a former player as a peer to the players that it would resonate.”

Bean added, “Once I stopped hiding and I was my best self, there’s been so many people in the LGBT community that have taught me invaluable lessons of why it’s important to be visible. I was a baseball player, and it’s interesting in 147 years only two major league players have ever disclosed that they were gay. That’s pretty interesting to say.

“Hopefully we’re working toward a time where a player will feel not only comfortable in the working environment but will decide that’s the best decision for them and they will just go about being judged as a baseball player and not what their family picture looks like.”

Bean is sympathetic, though. It might be easier to imagine a major leaguer coming out now than in his day, but that doesn’t make it easy. (Glenn Burke, who died of AIDS-related causes 1995, came out to teammates while playing, but not to the public.)

“Definitely, I have a clear understanding of why athletes have chosen not to do that yet,” he said. “There is a very short window of time to maximize your dream and thankfully from the great courage of people outside of sports - police officers, teachers, firemen, politicians, even entertainers now to some degree – people are seeing images and examples that if they do decide to share something that’s very personal and private it’s not an obstacle or hindrance for their career.

“But as an athlete in team sports specifically, you have to have a lot of things go your way, and I think there are probably a few players who I’m certain are much more comfortable with who and what they are than I was. I was never ready because I was struggling with my sexual orientation. I wasn’t out and proud. I didn’t have any images that would tell me otherwise.

“I was grieving the loss of my partner, who died of HIV, in what was to be the night before my last season. I was living in fear that whole year. I had no idea if I was healthy or not. Thankfully I was, but it could have easily gone the other way.

“My conversation, it changes in so many ways when you’re talking to LGBT communities about empowering yourself and making positive, healthy decisions, when we’re talking about bullying, how important it is to have a dialogue so the kids are not suffering in silence.

“And then when you’re talking to a room full of Major League Baseball players, you have to try to find something that’s relateable to their life experience. These guys are very young still. They’re focused on one thing. For many times they’re not really versed in what’s going on in the political arena. They don’t have time to think of other things. So, it varies every single day and it’s a wonderfully comprehensive challenge, but one I’m happy to take on each day.”

Bean said the eventual goal is for sexual orientation not to matter, “but until we talk about it or move through that first portion, inevitably we have to raise the visibility a little bit.”

That is where Saturday night’s event comes in.

“If the only thing that we take away from Saturday night is that a full stadium of Mets fans learn that there is an organization in Queens and Long Island that is devoted to trying to make going to and coming home from school a safer experience for the kids in their own community, whether they’re LGBT or not, then I would be thrilled,” he said.

“We have focused on making it about a bigger message. Certainly it would be great to see a couple of thousand fans running around with a Mets shirt that says ‘Pride Day, Aug. 13.’ To me that is going to start a conversation with people who might not be thinking about LGBT issues and for one day at least in that afternoon there is an alignment of a love for a baseball club in their community and that’s the New York Mets.

“You can look at it either way - that the world’s never going to be perfect and it’s a waste of time or you can look at it as, you know what, we’re going to do everything we can to try to make people a little bit closer to each other and realize when you do bring diverse groups together there are very, very few differences between us.

“The LGBT community, they love sports. Not everybody, but not everybody in the straight community loves sports, either. The LGBT communities in the New York area are raising families and have children and I just think it’s a wonderful example that on Saturday we can be supportive of the LGBT community and maybe Sunday or Monday next week we’re supporting the Latino community of Long Island or the Irish community or the firemen or the police officers.

“We have a chance to do something good, and we’re taking advantage of it.”",12/08/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics losses spike to $8.3 million,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Thursday reported its losses spiked in the April-June period compared with a year ago because of a one-time tax provision and fewer sales of its rapid tests for HIV and syphilis.

The Medford-based manufacturer said it lost $8.3 million in the three months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $664,000 a year earlier.

Nearly $6 million of the recent loss was due to an accounting practice called a “full valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset.”

The tax asset was created as a result of previous losses at the company, and it could be used to reduce future tax payments when the company earns a profit. But executives said the company would likely not use the tax asset “in the foreseeable future.” So the value of the asset was removed from the company’s balance sheet in the second quarter.

Accounting rules stipulate that the tax asset comes with a deadline, CFO Richard J. Larkin said recently. The company does not believe it can meet the deadline to use it, he said.

In the quarter, Chembio’s sales fell 51 percent to $3.3 million, year over year, because it was outbid by a competitor to provide some point-of-care tests to Brazil, and made fewer sales in Africa. Another factor in the decline was that Chembio assumed responsibility for U.S. sales of its HIV tests from an independent distributor, executives said.

CEO John J. Sperzel said the company is optimistic about the sales potential for its Zika virus test and a companion results reader in South America and elsewhere.

“We are hopeful that this product will receive U.S. government funding as well as approval following submissions to numerous regulatory agencies,” he said.

NewsDay,"Babylon pharmacist convicted in HIV drug scam, AG says","Authorities said he pocketed $25 million from the illegal sale of black-market medications, exposing HIV patients to risk.

Now, pharmacist Ira Gross, 63, of Babylon, faces up to 25 years in state prison for his role as “mastermind” of the scheme, in which Gross and his accomplices billed $274 million in illegal medication to Medicaid and other health care agencies — all while exposing patients to drugs “of unknown origin and potency” and, in some cases “drugs which were mislabeled” or which had “potentially expired,” New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in a statement Tuesday.

Gross was convicted Monday in a jury trial in Suffolk County Supreme Court, found guilty of first-degree grand larceny, first-degree attempted grand larceny, first-degree criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions, first-degree attempted criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions, three counts of first-degree money laundering, second-degree money laundering, first-degree commercial bribing and fourth-degree conspiracy. He faces 8 1⁄3 to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 8.

Gross was arrested by the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit in April 2012.

The shell company authorities said Gross used to conceal and distribute criminal proceeds also was found guilty of three counts of first-degree money laundering and one count each of second-degree money laundering and first-degree commercial bribing. A co-defendant, Glenn Schabel of Melville, described by authorities as the supervising pharmacist and compliance officer for the Melville-based MOMS pharmacy, pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in March, admitting that over a four-year period he had accepted more than $5 million in bribes.

Other defendants — Florida resident Stephen Manuel Costa and Texas resident Harry Abolafia — also previously pleaded guilty to their roles in the scam. Authorities said Gross’ wife, Lois Gross, and their adult children Dakota Gross and Chelsea Gross, remain civil defendants in a forfeiture action brought by the attorney general’s office, seeking the return “of proceeds and substituted proceeds” from the scheme held in their names.

Authorities said that Gross and Chapparal Services Ltd. illegally obtained medications through MOMS, described as “a high-volume online pharmacy” in Melville, with satellite offices in Manhattan, Brooklyn and in other states, then “dispensed the illegally obtained medication to Medicaid recipients” — all while billing the state Medicaid program.

Those medications were obtained, authorities charged, through illegal buybacks from patients, as well as through other illegal sources, then were rebottled using fake labels and serial numbers. Such medications can have broken seals or can even contain medications “different” from what’s indicated on the label, authorities said — all of which can put patients at significant risk.

In his statement, Schneiderman said, “As a licensed pharmacist, Gross understood the regulations of pharmaceutical distribution and knew how to evade them.”

The convictions were the result of a long-standing investigation called “Operation Black Market Meds.”

“The perpetrators of this complex scheme not only cheated the state Medicaid program out of millions of dollars, but preyed on some of New York’s most vulnerable patients just to make a quick buck,” Schneiderman said in his statement, adding: “These convictions should send a clear message that my office will not tolerate these types of abhorrent schemes. If you seek to line your pockets at the expense of the health and well-being of New Yorkers, you will be punished.”",09/08/2016

NewsDay,Zika fears lead NY to bar blood donations by South Florida visitors,"New Yorkers who have traveled to South Florida will be barred from donating blood for 28 days as collection centers begin crafting rules to keep Zika virus out of the blood supply.

Zika, a mere footnote in reports by blood center medical experts a year ago, has become a pathogen of extreme importance in recent months, experts said Tuesday.

Dr. Lou Katz, chief medical officer of America’s Blood Centers of which the New York Blood Center is an affiliate, said there are two screening tests under study by federal scientists that are capable of spotting Zika in a donated blood sample. They were so far along in development, Katz said, they have been deployed in Zika hot spots in the Caribbean.

The few tests that exist have been shipped to Florida and elsewhere on the Gulf Coast where Aedes aegypti, a Zika-carrying mosquito, is believed to be spreading the virus.

The New York Blood Center collects all blood types and blood products through a network of affiliated sites in Nassau and Suffolk counties. Other institutions and nonprofit organizations on the Island, such as the Red Cross and local hospitals, also collect and bank blood. The products enter the general supply and are used for a variety of purposes, from meeting surgical needs to providing blood for people who have injuries and are transfused in emergency rooms.

Zika’s unexpected emergence in recent months has forced blood centers to quickly cobble together a set of new rules.

“We are taking every precaution,” Katz said of making certain that Zika does not cause infection through transfused blood. He and other experts in blood banking said every two seconds somewhere in the United States someone needs a transfusion.

Katz said it took five years after the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s for scientists to develop a screening to detect HIV in the nation’s blood supply, but only nine months for experts to develop a test to screen for West Nile. With Zika, it took just two months to develop tests that spot it in a blood sample.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The two tests still under study but already in use have been identified as a Zika screening strategy developed by pharmaceutical giant Roche; the other was designed by the medical diagnostics company, Hologic in collaboration with its Spanish partner, Grifols.

Despite being under investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the tests were deemed critically needed when several people in South Florida became infected with Zika without evidence of having traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean. The cases strongly suggested mosquitoes in the area were carrying the pathogen.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, working with the Florida Department of Health, confirmed four locally transmitted cases of Zika last week in Miami-Dade and neighboring Broward counties. All of the infections were acquired in the same section of Miami. Ten more cases were confirmed by the CDC on Monday.

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, says his agency is working closely with several companies that are making blood screening tests to make sure screening can be expanded.

Last week the agency requested that blood collection centers South Florida cease blood collection to keep the supply safe.

Marintha Heil, director of the Roche molecular diagnostics division, said in a statement that her company saw a growing need for a screening after transfusion cases were documented in Brazil.

“At the beginning of this year, a Roche molecular diagnostics research team started designing a blood screening test. Several candidate detection sets and controls were synthesized and tested.”

Katz said with so much travel between New York and South Florida, he expects a 2 percent drop in blood donations because of the 28-day waiting period for donations from people who have traveled to the Sunshine State.",02/08/2016

NewsDay,"Seth Meyers’ ‘Late Night’ goes live again, and bam! Terrific","Seth Meyers wrapped his final “Late Night with Seth Meyers” of these conventions Thursday — make that Friday — and it was LIVE. No messy tape, or dubs, or post-edits or whatever else goes on in the control rooms of America’s late-night talk shows to make them seem funnier and better than they really are.

This was Meyers’ second live show — the first last week after Donald Trump’s acceptance speech — availing himself of relevance and immediacy:

“Morgan Freeman narrated” the Clinton promotional video Thursday night, “and for some reason, Hillary gave her speech as Morgan Freeman.”

Cut to picture of Freeman, in a perfectly white suit.

Meyers got fake-annoyed at her for co-opting the phrase “a closer look” (the name, of course, of “Late Night’s” “A Closer Look”):

“The next thing you know’s she going to start giving her speeches from behind a desk.”

There were a few more (extremely) topical jokes and then Meyers did one of those personal asides he is famous for — turning away from the anchor desk, addressing the camera — speaking for about a minute or so on why Trump is not releasing his tax returns:

Subscribe to the Entertainment newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

“I think you’re not releasing your tax returns BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE ANY MONEY. I think you don’t even have an accountant. I think you use TurboTax.”

The reason he’s running for president is because he “needs the $400,000 salary” ... ”for the free food” ... because Melania is insisting he finally get a job ...

And so on.

To co-opt a Trumpian word, it was terrific — funny, effortless, smart, and had absolutely nothing to do with Hillary or her white suit or her historic speech that had wrapped just a couple of hours before.

This proves two things: Meyers and “Late Night” didn’t really need to do a live show after all, because some jokes wear well regardless of live or tape.

The second, Trump is simply better material than Clinton. Always was. Always will be.

These last two weeks have been immensely important for three shows — “Late Show with Stephen Colbert” (which has been live), “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” and, finally, “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”

The first two have something to prove — that with all the hype and expectations of their launch just under a year ago, neither has still quite entered the zeitgeist, or scrubbed away the yearning or disappointment of David Letterman or Jon Stewart fans (“Oh, Stephen, the real one, I guess I like you fine, but I wish you were David...or the fake Stephen.”)

Both are hosts of established shows and both are also hosts seeking their footing.

But “Late Night” and Meyers are different stories. Meyers has been the stealth late-night guy — nothing much to prove, and doesn’t care if you believe that or not. Nevertheless, he’s still the late late LATE night guy — plying his trade out there in the cool darkness of morning, while the fleets of Manhattan garbage trucks are yawing and groaning their way through the not-entirely-deserted streets while dodging the not-entirely-sober pedestrians.

Who’s watching this? Who cares?!

In fact, who cares are the fans. “Late Night” fans don’t seem to have any quibbles with this fare. Meyers is still Seth Meyers — only a better version of his “SNL” Seth Meyers. His show is exactly what you would expect it to be for someone like him — bespoke, and tailored precisely to his strengths. Weaknesses have been expunged. It’s a lean enterprise that doesn’t seem to need bells/whistles/kitsch/gimmickry that draws attention to itself, or is designed to move the restless hand of the hivemind to click on some specially designed clickbait.

He joked last night about Clinton’s catchy but daunting slash at Trump — the “midnight in America” line — saying, “frankly, it’s an insult to us who come on at 1 a.m. Midnight is not terrible.”

Not it’s not — not here, anyway.

These have been two excellent weeks for Meyers, and largely hidden from view. People (or critics) have been too busy talking about The Rebirth of Stephen Colbert, or the Return of Stephen Colbert, or The Banishment of Stephen Colbert — and good for Stephen Colbert, by the way.

But what they are missing is one of the most seamless shows on late-night television. The heart of this enterprise, of course, is “A Closer Look” — “Late Night’s” set piece that covers the day’s news.

It’s a rat-a-tat of setups and punchlines. It’s also the most efficient joke delivery machine in all of late night.

There are probably 20 jokes, give or take, over “Closer Look’s” eight-minute stretch, and almost every one of them these last two weeks has worked; not a single groaner, in fact. This batting average isn’t perfect — Seth Meyers and his writing staff aren’t some sort of late-night Ted Williams — but they have a very good ear for knowing what works, and what needs to be junked before it gets on the air.

Some jokes are simply amusing, some funny but — a guarantee — there will be at least one joke per “A Closer Look” that will be laugh-out-loud funny. And you’ll never know when it’s coming or what will be the substance of it.

Quick example: The other night, Meyers cited torrential rainstorms over Manhattan, spawning waterfalls in subways, which is the closest most Manhattanites will ever come to seeing nature, he quipped.

Amusing, fine, but what followed was the “out loud” part:

He turns to the camera, and becomes of those nature-smitten New Yorkers: “I saw the most beautiful waterfall last night — full of rats.”

NewsDay,"Dave Marash talks career at ‘Nightline,’ Al Jazeera, more","Dave Marash was a celebrated anchor-reporter in New York TV and network news for 40 years. Then, after a brief run at Al Jazeera — preceded by a distinguished 16-year one at “Nightline” — ended in 2008, he took his leave. Marash, now 74, and his wife, Amy, also a former TV producer, have lived in New Mexico for the past few years, but far from being entirely off the grid, Marash now hosts a near-daily podcast, “Here and There With Dave Marash” — available at http://davemarash.com The interview series is a thoughtful and deeply serious exploration of the world by someone who spent the better part of a career doing some serious exploring himself. I spoke recently by phone with Marash. Below is an edited version of our chat:

What did you do after the Al Jazeera run ended?

In 2009, Amy was the producer-videographer and I was the writer/correspondent for a series of reports on the — alas — all too short-lived “World Focus” for PBS . . . [then] I went to China and taught for a semester, and . . . in 2012, we moved to New Mexico. In 2014, I became the co-news director of public radio station KSFR, then gave that up to start the program “Here and There.”

Why New Mexico?

By 2012, it seemed pretty definitive that the television news business had left me and there was no professional need to be in the New York / Washington ambit. My wife had lived there for most of the ’90s and . . . I said, “Let’s try it.” I haven’t regretted it for one minute.

You’ve had a beard your entire career — the only TV newsman for many years who indeed had one. Why?

I was a radio guy (at 1010 WINS, and Newsradio 88), never expected to work in television, but back then, the only person — except for Santa Claus — who had a beard on TV was me. I didn’t enjoy shaving and I guess you could say it grew on me. I think I look better with it.

You were indeed a unique hybrid — a bearded reporter and anchor who also covered sports and serious news. Explain that unusual twist:

I was always a sports fan and back in the ’60s and ’70s when I did a lot of shuffling between news and sports, they were done exactly the same way. There was no stylistic or professional issue. If you remember the great New York newsman Jim Gordon [radio voice of the Giants, who died in 2003] . . . I went up to him and said, “You are my hero, and doing what I want to do. How do you get away with doing both news and sports?” He said, “It’s very simple. Just make sure you know what you are talking about, then you . . . will have credibility with” listeners and viewers.

You were also at “20/20” for a few years back in the ’80s. Why did you leave?

Because I couldn’t fit myself into the industrial pattern of “20/20,” which wanted its correspondents to do 25 stories a year and do them in a way in which the producer actually did all of the reporting and so much of the writing. I always insisted on writing my own material and report my own material. My byline meant something to me. Even back when I was anchoring [at WCBS/2] I insisted that I be able to do real reporting.

Local TV news has changed dramatically. Why?

The commitment to serious coverage has declined. My God, over the 45-year period we’re talking about, there was a time early on when during the legislative session in Albany, all three network-owned stations had an Albany correspondent who went to Albany and stayed there for the duration and covered the legislature and state courts as intensely as I and my colleagues were covering city politics. My guess is that 25 years since, New York stations haven’t spent a nickel to have an Albany bureau. It’s a loss because what happens in Albany matters in New York City and the suburbs.

What happened?

In many ways the transformation of television news occurred when “60 Minutes” demonstrated you could make a lot of money doing news, and because of “60,” it became an imperative for all of the news divisions and local news — which had been carried as loss leaders — to make money, too. It was easier to make money if you lighten up your news and make it into what we now called click-bait news.”

Your own style and approach fit perfectly at “Nightline.”

It was by far professionally the best thing that ever happened to me, and “Nightline” under Ted Koppel was an incomparable program. Because of our small staff of four correspondents, I was the only one who had a real palate for international reporting and became de facto the international correspondent covering some of the most interesting stories of our time, and covering them in the serious longform way that was the hallmark of “Nightline.”

I spent a lot of time in the Balkans covering wars and a lot of time in Israel — the West Bank — and eventually went to Iraq and covered that war; also HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, where Ted allowed me three consecutive taped programs — 51 minutes of content — to show a society that had been completely redefined by the overwhelming presence of AIDS.

What did “Nightline” mean to network news?

Ted Koppel was probably the smartest man and certainly the best and toughest interviewer in American television history going back to Edward R. Murrow, and “Nightline” was a show that only did real and significant news stories and only did them in a way that gave respect to their seriousness and complexity.

The most satisfying story in your long run there?

The story of a Kosovar girl, Ibadete Thaqi, who lost both her legs, one below and one above the knee, to a Serbian booby trap. We found her in the hospital in Kosovo, and we were doing a story on war crimes, and she was the victim of a war crime and, at the time, 13 years old. She projected such dignity and sincerity and intelligence that three weeks later when I got back to the states and “Nightline,” I was asked, “Have you checked your mail?” Most was about “how can we help this girl?” . . . Eventually these people paid to bring her to the United States to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, one of the best in the world, and which treated her gratis and fitted her for prosthetics. Eventually she trained as a prosthetist and still works at the Hospital for Special Surgery. I usually see her once a year in New York, and watch her move on her prosthetic legs up and down subway stairs and on crowded sidewalks and think, you can never know what she’s gone through . . . By far the most satisfying story of my career.

Al Jazeera hired you to gain credibility in the U.S. market — also to prove that it wasn’t anti-Semitic, as some early critics charged. But the relationship quickly soured — why?

They were and are a serious news channel, and I was there for two years, but there were great changes between when I was hired and left. I was the senior anchor in Washington, autonomous from headquarters in Doha [Qatar], and could claim complete editorial responsibility for reporting the Western Hemisphere, but over the two-year period, reporting control shifted entirely to Doha. . . . To say I resisted would be an understatement. It became a point of continued conflict to where I felt I had to leave, and they happened to agree with me.

And so, your podcast.

People might say I had left network news, but I always felt it had left me. The consequences were the same. But I have to tell you, I’m having so much fun and get so much satisfaction from doing a 50-minute conversation with some of the best reporters and analysts in the world about significant news stories, and doing it here in New Mexico and the American West.",27/07/2016
NewsDay,‘Not Pretty Enough’ review: Entertaining bio of Helen Gurley Brown,"NOT PRETTY ENOUGH: The Unlikely Triumph of Helen Gurley Brown, by Gerri Hirshey. Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 500 pp., $27.

If there’s nothing more American than a rags-to-riches story, then Helen Gurley Brown was truly an All-American Girl. The author of “Sex and the Single Girl” and later editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, writes biographer Gerri Hirshey, began life as “a very poor and traumatized child of the Depression,” the fatherless daughter of a miserable mother, a skinny girl beset by acne, not pretty enough to succeed in a world where, her mother insisted, beauty was a woman’s only weapon.

Born in Arkansas in 1922, Helen Gurley’s world was rocked at age 10 by her father’s death in a freak elevator accident. Helen and her older sister were left to endure their mother’s unpredictable moods, strange ideas and disastrous plans. After running through what money they had, Cleo Gurley packed up her daughters and moved the family to Los Angeles. (She had, Hirshey writes, “unreasonable and unfulfilled hopes” of financial support from some nearby relatives.)

Yet even as her mother and sister faced one calamity after another, Helen began to display the grit, perseverance and creativity that would fuel her eventual success. It didn’t happen overnight: There were 19 secretarial gigs before she landed her first non-menial job, as a copywriter at a downtown L.A. ad agency. Along the way, she honed another set of skills — how to live stylishly on very little money, build a tightknit circle of supportive girlfriends and (most crucially for her future career) how to have fun, in and out of bed, with men.

“She understood the fierce tyrannies of conventional beauty,” Hirshey writes. But in its absence, Helen developed “her signature skill, a flexible double whammy of psychological and sexual seduction.” She took lovers, married and unmarried, and had what even today seems an impressive amount of sex. (Later in life, she told a friend she had slept with 178 men.) Whatever emotional turmoil she felt was soothed by psychotherapy — she was an early adherent — even when some of it sounds cringe-worthy, as in the case of her California group therapy that included “nudity, hypnosis, and intense role-playing.”

All would become fodder for “Sex and the Single Girl,” the 1962 guidebook that made her famous — and, Hirshey argues, was in its own way as radical as Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique,” published the following year. When her book came out, she herself was no longer single; she married movie producer David Brown in 1959, a match that would move her to New York, enable her to write a book and ignite her career as a magazine editor for the next three decades.

It was through her husband’s publishing connections that Helen Gurley Brown landed at the top of the Cosmopolitan masthead, charged with turning around a moribund magazine. Under Brown’s editorship, Cosmo became a cultural juggernaut. Its articles covered just about every topic its young female readers wanted to read about — and undoubtedly several they hadn’t known they wanted to read. (A small sample includes “The Poor Girls’ Guide to America’s Rich Young Men,” “How to Make a Small Bosom Amount to Something” and “How to Give Your Cat a Pill.”) Cosmo also published movie and book reviews, celebrity profiles and fiction by writers as disparate as Edna O’Brien and Jacqueline Susann — a consequence, writes Hirshey, of “the affable, high/low cultural dynamic” between Helen and David.

In an era of rapid social change, Brown’s once-revolutionary attitude toward women, work and sex quickly began to seem dated. Feminists demonstrated against her daffy femininity. Although sexism “had dogged and demeaned her relentlessly” dating back to her secretarial days, Hirshey notes, Brown didn’t focus on systemic issues of inequality; “instead she addressed herself to bettering the small, quotidian lives toiling within the status quo.” Her editorial instincts faltered at times; under her leadership the magazine barely acknowledged issues faced by black women, ignored the tangle of motherhood and work and reacted bizarrely to the AIDS crisis, publishing a 1988 article claiming women couldn’t contract HIV from men. By the time she was gently nudged toward retirement in 1997, her Cosmo seemed woefully out of step.

Still, Hirshey, a veteran observer of the cultural scene, argues effectively for Brown’s enduring influence, not only in the world of magazine publishing, but in the way women live and talk about their lives. Her own writing sometimes slips into the same kind of breathless frivolity her subject was known for — readers may yearn for fewer girlish exclamations and winking wordplay. Still, the book, like its subject, can be surprisingly thought-provoking, and even at its lightest, it’s vivid, funny and terrifically entertaining.",26/07/2016
NewsDay,Prince Harry gets tested for HIV to raise awareness,"In an effort to combat his country’s rising HIV rates and to destigmatize testing, England’s Prince Harry on Thursday livestreamed himself on Facebook undergoing the quick and simple procedure.

Administered at a London hospital by psychotherapist Robert Palmer, an official with the UK’s National Health Service Foundation Trust, the test involved a momentary finger-prick and gave almost immediate results that showed the prince, 31, was HIV negative.

At one point Harry put across a message while also poking fun at his red hair. “So whether you’re a man, woman, gay, straight, black, white, whatever, even ginger, why wouldn’t you come have a test?” he asked Palmer rhetorically. As of Thursday afternoon, the video had received more than 1.1 million views.

Elton John was among those applauding the prince’s efforts, comparing them to those of Harry’s late mother. “In 1991, Princess Diana moved a mountain by addressing the stigma surrounding people living with HIV/AIDS,” the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer posted on Instagram. “She showed the world we could safely wrap our arms around AIDS patients, by shaking hands with a patient without gloves. … Today in London, Prince Harry gave that stigma a knock on the head by showing the world how easy and simple it is to take an HIV test. Bravo Prince Harry! Your mother would be so proud of you.”

The Royal Family’s Facebook page noted that “up to 17% of HIV positive patients are unaware of their status and unintentionally pass on the virus to partners. Prince Harry believes until everyone feels relaxed about taking HIV tests … the stigma and fear surrounding HIV testing will continue to allow the virus to win.”

On Wednesday, Prince Harry will arrive in Durban, South Africa, for the International AIDS Conference, and the following day meet with a number of leaders in the fight against the disease.",14/07/2016
NewsDay,Seaford teen poked by hypodermic needle at Jones Beach,"A Seaford teenager is undergoing precautionary blood testing after finding a hypodermic needle under her beach towel on Jones Beach earlier this week.

The needle didn’t pierce her skin, but Anna Gagliano, 15, said she felt something poke her in the back after she laid on the towel Tuesday at Field 4.

After she moved the towel and felt another poke, she said she searched and found the needle and syringe in the sand.

“I was freaking out. I actually almost cried. I was thinking, ‘What the heck just happened?’ ” Gagliano said Saturday. “I was trying to think what it was used for.”

Gagliano said she reported the syringe to lifeguards and was treated on the beach by paramedics, who checked and cleaned her back.

The family’s doctor reported the incident to the state Department of Health, which advised a series of blood tests for diseases including HIV and hepatitis, Gagliano said. She said she will be tested again in six weeks; 12 weeks; and 24 weeks.

Syringes have been found on Long Island beaches in the past, but the discoveries are rare, officials said. Long Island beaches usually attract about 13 million visitors each year.

Park employees clean beaches and use a surf rake to sweep sand daily, said George Gorman, deputy regional director of Long Island state parks.

NewsDay,"Hope, renewed fear mark 1st anniversary of gay marriage ruling","The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling one year ago Sunday legalizing same-sex marriage was a milestone young people in Long Island’s LGBT community said reassured them about their futures, and older members called a validation after years of secrecy and shame.

But the mass murder of mostly gay patrons at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando earlier this month — and hundreds of anti-gay laws and legislation introduced this year across the nation — make clear the distance still to go toward acceptance and security, advocates say.

“I think what happened in Orlando is a stark reminder of the hate and bias that still exist,” said David Kilmnick, founder and CEO of the LGBT Network, based in Woodbury. “Young people will share that there is plenty of homophobia and transphobia that still exist. . . . Real-world experience speaks volumes that no matter what laws are passed, that there is still a lot more work to do.”

In the year since marriage equality was legalized nationally in a 5-4 court vote, North Carolina passed legislation barring transsexuals from public bathrooms that don’t correspond to the gender on their birth certificates and banning localities from enacting LGBT anti-discrimination protections. Mississippi enacted a similar law.

The response to the Orlando killings “has been heartening and in itself is a sign of progress [and] acceptance . . . but every day we see so much discrimination, aggression and violence against the LGBT community,” said Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal, the oldest national organization working toward their legal and civil rights.

Over the last year, she said, more than 200 anti-LGBT bills have been introduced in state legislatures, and state laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination are in effect in fewer than half the states. “The marriage equality ruling is not the milestone, it’s a milestone and it’s one stop” in a journey with “quite a ways to go.”

Yet Lisa Diedrich, who teaches in the women’s, gender and sexuality studies department at Stony Brook University, said she saw a generational shift among younger people toward acceptance of LGBT people and acceptance of marriage equality “has been one of the most significant shifts in attitudes in American society over the last 20, 30 years.” Despite lingering homophobia and fears, “students tend to be supportive,” she said.

She said that while not all LGBT community members agreed on the focus on marriage equality in the years leading up to its legalization, they understood its importance in “terms of civil and symbolic rights.”

The legalization of same-sex marriage removed a lasting and stinging stigma, said Alex Passante, 17, of Bay Shore, who will attend college in the fall.

“I didn’t think I’d ever be able to get married legally and have a family and now I can look forward to my future instead of dreading it,” she said.

Jonathan LaFlare, 27, who works in the banking industry and lives in Lindenhurst, says he, too, now foresees a married life with children, something he always wanted but felt was not possible because “common society would look at me and my family funny. Now I don’t feel that way anymore. We’re not a freak.”

Although in the LGBT community many embrace marriage equality as a validation, others dismiss it and some critique the institution.

A recent meeting of SAGE, a LGBT Network group for gay, lesbian and bisexual seniors, included Bob Larsaro of Plainview, an 80-year-old practicing Catholic who was devotedly married to a woman for 50 years and said he believes traditional marriage is a religious rite for men and women.

Also in the group was Dennis, 75, who asked that only his first name be used. He said he doesn’t consider “a gay marriage a marriage . . . there needs to be a different word invented.”

And Linda Rich, 69, of Dix Hills, a retired school social worker whose partner died a few years ago, said that marriage wasn’t “on the radar” and wouldn’t have been likely because her partner of 38 years was reticent to openly declare her homosexuality.

Rich said marriage would have provided more financial security by giving her a share of her partner’s estate and pension after her death. “As it is, I got nothing,” she said.

But also at that table was Roy Schmitt, 68, of Lynbrook, a retired principal who, after a youthful marriage to a woman, married his longtime same-sex partner in Toronto in 2005. They have been together for 36 years.

“Getting married, it was huge,” he said. “I get all emotional: It meant that we belonged, we were valued, and we were accepted.”

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people represented about 20 percent of the 5,462 hate crime victims reported to the FBI by law enforcement in 2014 — a decrease overall from the prior year — although widely considered to significantly underrepresent actual hate crime numbers.

The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, a New York-based counseling and advocacy group with national outreach, released its latest report on hate crimes against the LGBT community on June 14, two days after the Orlando massacre. Based on last year’s data collected from 13 coalition organizations in 11 states, the report analyzed 1,253 incidents of hate violence. States included New York, Texas, Colorado, Vermont, Minnesota, Missouri, Massachusetts, Michigan, California, Ohio and Arizona.

The report found “24 hate violence related homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people in 2015, a 20 percent increase in the number of reports compared to 2014. People of color and transgender and gender nonconforming people made up the majority” of those victims. Of the 24 homicides, 16 were transgender and gender-nonconforming, including 13 transgender women of color. A total of 15 of the 24 homicide victims were black or Latino.

In addition, according to the report, “People of color and undocumented survivors were more likely to experience physically violent forms of hate violence,” with the most common types of reported incidents verbal harassment (15 percent), discrimination (14 percent), physical violence (12 percent) and threats or intimidation (11 percent). More than half involved people known to each other, including employers, landlords and family members.

Carol Quirke, professor of American studies at SUNY Old Westbury and director of the college’s Women’s Center, said there is a persistent fear of violence and rejection in the LGBT community even though she has seen a significant drop in homophobia over the past 12 years of teaching.

“We’re in a moment where both are true: marriage can be legal and people can still fear violence and are still incredibly anxious about coming out to their parents,” she said.

While there are those who critique marriage as an institution, federal recognition of “gay marriage was a huge coup for all those groups who brought this to fruition,” said Mary Jo Bona, professor and chair of women’s, gender, and sexuality studies at Stony Brook University, noting the new freedom to explore gender and sexuality.

“It’s clear that our students today feel that there is more possibility, that alternative choices are more acceptable,” she said.

But “there is still a lot of shame and discomfort with sexual orientation . . . it’s still an issue for people, and coming out is still a process.”

Jon Cooper, a businessman and the first openly gay Suffolk County legislator, said the difference now from his boyhood — when he knew of no visibly gay people and had no gay role models — is enormous.

“It will be the same as a gay couple looking back to when they couldn’t get married,” he said, likening it to when mixed-race couples were legally forbidden to marry in some states. “They will be incredulous that there were days when it was like that.”",25/06/2016
NewsDay,Orlando shooting: Patron says ‘I dodged bullets’,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Gabriel Ramirez couldn’t think.

It was just non-stop gunshots.

But he managed to escape out the back of Pulse nightclub as the deadliest mass shooting in American history started to unfold.

“I dodged bullets. I legit dodged bullets,” Ramirez said. “The only reason I’m alive is because one of the bartenders opened the back fence to the gate and I didn’t stop running. I didn’t look back.”

The 25-year-old Orlando man sprinted to his car.

“I couldn’t stop. I just kept going,” he said. “That could have been me. I could have been on a list.”

Visibly shaken just 48 hours later, Ramirez often broke down into tears Monday as he talked about the night when a gunman unleashed carnage in the gay downtown Orlando club leaving 49 dead and dozens more injured.

“I looked back one time and everyone was on the floor. I thought they were just being smart and thinking ‘I’m going to duck,’” he said. “But God knows if [the shooter] already got to them.”

Completely distraught and sleep deprived, Ramirez wanted to talk to a grief counselor so he had a friend drop him off at The Center, an LGBT community center in Orlando.

And Ramirez wasn’t alone.

The LGBT center has been flooded with an outpouring of community members and volunteers still in shock as they continued to find out more about the victims who were killed and injured.

“Every time I stop and think about it, I break down and cry,” said Joel Morales, an HIV counselor at the center. “But Orlando is strong and everyone is coming together and doing their part.”

The center has been a hub providing grief counseling and a place where members of the community can come together to mourn the losses of their “brothers and sisters.”

“It’s very difficult to see the names posted on Facebook and the familiar faces,” Morales said. “It’s a really difficult time here in Orlando. [But] we are not going to be afraid. Now more than ever, we need to support each other and come together as one.”

Krystal Rosa, 25, sat a table in the back of the center as she made a memorial sign in the shape of a heart.

She and her friends go to Pulse all the time. But last weekend they decided to go to Cocoa Beach instead.

Rosa tried to go to work Monday morning, but it was just too much for her listening to her co-workers talk about the shooting. She told her bosses she was leaving early and sought comfort at the LGBT center.

“We knew people. It could have been any of us,” Rosa said. “We are thankful to be here. … So we just want to give back a little of what was taken away.”",14/06/2016
NewsDay,Orlando's Pulse nightclub was a safe haven for the community,"It was known as a gay bar in Orlando that “always welcomed everyone with open arms.”

Now, Pulse nightclub will forever be known as the place where the worst mass shooting in the U.S. left at least 49 dead and dozens injured after a gunman opened fire Sunday.

For Long Island native Evan Legnerb, Pulse was a fun, safe place.

“It was comforting and welcoming to go there and enjoy the place,” 27-year-old Legnerb said. “There were no social expectations. It didn’t matter who you were when you walked through the door.”

Legnerb, who grew up in Wading River and has lived in Florida for about four years, had been to the club on a number of occasions.

“It really reached out to many walks of life,” said Legnerb, who is gay. ""It’s a place that’s really comforting for a group that is often targeted through various forms of discrimination.”

Situated along downtown Orlando’s busy Orange Avenue that is dotted with restaurants, bars, apartments and other small businesses, Pulse has been a staple in the gay community for more than a decade.

“I can’t ever go back in there,” said Xiomara Rodriguez, 24, who is gay and went to Pulse regularly. “This attacked everyone. But it was more of an attack against gay people.”

Pulse was more than “just another gay club,” declared a 2015 post on the nightclub’s website, accessible through an Internet archiving site. The post says co-founders and owners, Barbara Poma and Ron Legler, opened the club in 2004 in memory of Poma’s brother John, who was gay and died in 1991 after a battle with HIV. They hoped the club would keep his memory alive, so they chose the name Pulse – for John’s heartbeat.

If Pulse was striving to promote love and equality, it succeeded in Rodriguez’s eyes.

“It was a loving place. That club was a place where love was appreciated. Even if you didn’t know anyone you made friends,” Rodriguez said. “You felt welcomed. It didn’t matter who you were.”

The night of the shooting happened to be Latin Night.

“As it is the LGBT community is marginalized and we have to face a lot of oppression ... that club is supposed to be a safe space,” said Laura Caicedo, 21, who is gay. “I know a lot of the victims’ names have been hispanic. And that is just another hit to the community.”

Currently, the nightclub’s website displays only this message from Poma:

“Like everyone in the country, I am devastated about the horrific events that have taken place today. Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years. From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community. I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to all who have lost loved ones. Please know that my grief and heart are with you.”",13/06/2016
NewsDay,Medical malpractice lawsuit bill stalls in state Senate,"ALBANY — A bill that would allow more patients with cancer, HIV and other serious maladies to sue for medical malpractice has been overwhelmingly approved by the state Assembly, but it stands a dwindling chance of even getting a floor debate in the Senate.

Behind this stalemate in these last seven days of the 2016 legislative session is a titanic battle of two of Albany’s biggest lobbying forces: doctors and lawyers.

Currently, patients can sue for malpractice only within 2 1⁄2 years “from the date of the act, omission or failure complained of last treatment,” even though symptoms might not appear in that time. The proposal would reset that window to begin after a patient discovers the health problem.

People who say they are caught in the middle include Elissa McMahon, a 46-year-old mother who is facing late-stage cancer after she said it was misdiagnosed for two years, and the husband and daughter of the late June Dreifuss of Greenlawn, who died at 43, two years after, her husband says, breast cancer was missed in her annual mammogram.

McMahon, who worked as a social worker and lives in Massachusetts, said medical treatment in 2012 at a New York hospital, which included cancer screening, misdiagnosed the cause of her back pain. More than two years later, the cancer was detected by a second physician, three months after the deadline by which she could sue the hospital, which she said had given her a clean bill of health.

For Dreifuss, breast cancer had spread to her bones before she was accurately diagnosed and treated, according to her husband, Michael. While she was being treated, their 6-year-old son, James, was diagnosed with brain cancer. Her son died in 2008 and June Dreifuss died three months later.

During that time, the family had focused on treatment for June and their son, not contemplating a malpractice suit. They didn’t know the legal clock was ticking.

“When you have cancer, you don’t think about malpractice. You think about hospitals and treatment,” Michael Dreifuss said in an interview.

With two weeks left in the legislative session, the bill faces unlikely passage despite widespread support. The Democrat-led Assembly approved the bill, 120-25. It has 38 co-sponsors in the Senate — more than the 32 votes needed to pass legislation.

But a spokesman for the Senate’s Republican majority, which under Albany’s rules controls the flow of legislation, said it’s unclear whether the bill will advance.

The bill died in the Senate last year. This year the bill hasn’t budged from its initial committee since January, despite the clout of its primary sponsor, Senate Deputy Majority Leader John DeFrancisco (R-Syracuse).

The bill isn’t in the pipeline that could get it a floor debate before the scheduled end of the session on June 16. DeFrancisco didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Democrats criticized the standstill.

“It’s a critically important reform that unfortunately is being bottled up, despite the fact that the majority of senators are sponsors,” said Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens).

The Medical Society of the State of New York — the lobby representing physicians — opposes the measure. It cites a study that predicts a big spike in malpractice claims if the measure is adopted. That will drive up New York’s already high medical malpractice insurance rates for physicians and hospitals as well as drive up the already high cost of health care insurance for New Yorkers, the group argues.

This month, the Medical Society placed ads and met with senators to fight what it calls a threat to the “already precarious stability of many New York hospitals and medical liability insurers.”

The trade publication Emergency Physicians Monthly said New York has among the highest malpractice rates in the nation because of frequent, high-payout cases.

During this two-year legislative session, the Medical Society contributed more than $92,000 to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, with more to individual senators, including more than $4,000 to Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan (R-East Northport).

The Hospital Association of New York State contributed another $159,000 to the Senate Republican campaign in the last two years along with another $11,000 to the Independent Democratic Conference, which works with the GOP majority.

On the other side, the New York State Trial Lawyers Association counters that cancer, HIV and other diseases can go undetected after a failed diagnosis well beyond the 2 1⁄2-year window to sue. These patients are left without recourse to pay for care and suffering from a past mistake by a health care provider, the civil suit lawyers argue.

The Trial Lawyers Association alone contributed $364,100 to the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee.

“It doesn’t work in the public’s interest,” said Doug Muzzio, a political scientist from Baruch College. “Thirty-eight votes should bring it to the floor (in the Senate). That fact that they don’t have a mechanism or don’t have the guts to do it is awe-inspiring — one sits in awe of the way Albany operates.”

Supporters of the measure say more time is needed because several cancer screenings are recommended only every three years. “That meant cancer ran amok in my system for two years,” McMahon said in an interview. “I have a very poor prognosis.”

McMahon said she has advanced cancer in her back and liver, and now is concerned about how her 15-year-old son, Jack, will continue without her.

“I’m just trying to do the best I can because my life is over at 46,” said McMahon, now living with her sister. “I really have to leave some kind of protection and provision for my son.”",05/06/2016
NewsDay,"Port Jefferson ‘Maker Faire’ draws 1,000 adults, children","The fiery steel fish sculpture displayed off Port Jefferson Harbor wasn’t just a piece of art.

“Hot Pursuit,” which illustrated how fish group together to survive against predators, was one of about 100 exhibits designed to teach lessons about science and math at the Eastern Long Island Mini Maker Faire on Saturday.

Saturday’s event, organized by the Maritime Explorium in Port Jefferson Harbor, attracted more than 1,000 adults and children who checked out exhibits that included robotic Lego devices, a 3-D printer, jewelry making and a cosmic-ray detector.

“Hot Pursuit,” a 10-foot-tall fire sculpture created by New Jersey-based artist collective Funtown Studios, featured three silver striped bass moving up toward small bait fish swimming closely together at the top of the sculpture.

It offered biology lessons — illustrating, for example, how a single straggler fish in the sculpture that became separated from the protection of the group was about to be eaten by a bass, said Sandra Schaller, 46, a Funtown member.

The sculpture also demonstrated how some stoves and heating systems work. Visitors could deliver propane vapor to a pilot light by pushing a green button that used electricity to control a valve, creating a burst of fire.

“You’re not just looking at it and walking by,” Schaller said. “You’re actually interacting with it.”

Inside the Explorium, George Hart, a sculptor and a research professor in engineering at Stony Brook University, was directing participants in putting together a spherical object using 60 identical 2-foot-long pieces of laser-cut plywood.

The object illustrated icosahedral symmetry, which is the pattern of HIV and of some microscopic creatures, he said.

Brenda Allen, a fifth-grade teacher at Franklin Elementary School in Hempstead, fastened some of the plywood pieces together with plastic ties. She said the fair was giving her ideas of how to bring mathematical ideas to life in the classroom.

“You can work with kids on a higher level” with hands-on activities, she said.

Joshua Ecker, 14, of Port Jefferson, said he thought the exhibits were a more effective way to learn than memorizing sentences from a textbook.

“For a science test, I’ll study something using a science text and probably forget it,” he said. “Being hands-on, I’m going to remember it for a lifetime.”",04/06/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics reduces prices of rapid HIV tests,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has reduced the price of its HIV tests as the company takes full control of its U.S. sales after using a third party for some time.

The Medford-based manufacturer said its rapid tests for HIV will be sold under the DPP HIV ½, Sure Check HIV ½ and HIV ½ Stat-Pak names to public health clinics and other institutions for $5 per test.

“We streamlined our U.S. distribution channels and we are passing the savings on to public health customers,” CEO John J. Sperzel said Wednesday.

“We believe the $5 price to the public health market represents a reduction of approximately 25 percent compared to the average public-health price” charged by all makers of point-of-care HIV tests, he said. He declined to quantify the size of the price reduction by Chembio.

Sperzel also said in an interview that he hopes the price cut will “increase testing frequency and reduce rates of HIV infection.”

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 50,000 new HIV infections per year in the United States, a number that hasn’t declined despite increased availability of rapid tests. More than 1 million people are living with the disease domestically.

Chembio’s tests use blood or saliva samples. Previously, some were sold by a third party under the Clearview name.

Outside the United States, Chembio sells HIV tests directly to governments and global procurement organizations as well as using distributors, Sperzel said.

NewsDay,Cuomo’s HIV/AIDS legislation targets 2020 to end epidemic,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced legislation Sunday that would implement parts of his plan to eliminate HIV/AIDS as an epidemic by 2020, but advocates said it leaves out some of his task force’s recommendations.

The bill would allow minors to access HIV treatment without parental consent and allow care coordinators and care-management systems to share information about HIV-infected patients. It also would lift the upper age limit of a law requiring patients be offered an HIV test. Currently, the test is required to be offered only to those 64 and younger.

The bill also would allow registered nurses to screen for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.

In a statement, Cuomo said, “The initiatives in this legislation are key to building on the progress we have already made.”

But advocates said the proposed law does not include some of the recommendations made by a task force he convened two years ago on the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

“What they’re doing is good, is smart public health that was promoted and developed by a task force he convened,” said Jeremy Saunders, co-executive director of advocacy group VOCAL New York. He said, though, “there are two things left out.”

Specifically, Saunders said the task force recommended expansion of a syringe access program. More importantly, groups hoped for $50 million for housing rental assistance for HIV patients, including $17 million for those living outside New York City.

Two years ago, Cuomo issued a three-point plan to end the AIDS epidemic in New York. Key among tenets in that resolution was a call for an all-out effort to reduce the number of new HIV infections to under 750 a year.

Activists complained Cuomo last year promised $200 million in state funding, but his office later clarified it would be paid over five years. Activists want $70 million included in this year’s budget, especially for housing assistance.

James Plastiras, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said in an email late Sunday he is “optimistic” an agreement with legislators related to housing assistance will be reached before the end of the legislative session.

A syringe exchange is being considered as part of other proposals, he said.",15/05/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics loss narrows on higher HIV test sales,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Thursday reported that its loss narrowed in the January-March period compared with a year earlier on higher sales of the company’s HIV tests in the United States.

The Medford-based developer of rapid tests for HIV, and for malaria, Ebola, Zika and other diseases marked by fever said it lost $304,000 in the first quarter compared with a loss of $647,000 in the first three months of 2015.

Sales climbed to $6.6 million in the quarter, a gain of 6 percent, year over year.

CEO John J. Sperzel said Chembio’s financial performance benefited from an increase of 78 percent, or $1 million, in domestic sales of point-of-care tests for HIV.

“We are pleased with the demand for our HIV products in the U.S., and, as previously noted, effective June 1, 2016 we will begin selling the Sure Check HIV 1/2 assay in the U.S. through our existing sales force and distribution channels,” he said in a statement.

The Sure Check tests have been sold by a third party in the past after being manufactured by Chembio.

Sperzel also said the company continues to develop rapid tests for diseases involving fevers, most notably Zika. It is seeking regulatory approval to introduce a Zika test in Brazil, where many are affected by the disease.

NewsDay,‘Honey’ review: Katy B offers a busy hive of collaborations,"THE GRADE B+ BOTTOM LINE Building a sweet, eclectic club night vibe.

On her new album, “Honey” (Rinse/Virgin EMI), Katy B proves herself to be a pop music rarity. She shuns the spotlight.

Though Katy is best known for her 2011 debut, “On a Mission,” that hit No. 1 on the British charts and gave dubstep and underground club beats a recognizable face, she seems happy to take a supportive back seat to her collaborators throughout “Honey.”

That means she drifts into the tropical-tinged pop world of Major Lazer and Craig David on the catchy “Who Am I” and then transforms herself into a ’90s-styled house diva on the uplifting “I Wanna Be” with Chris Lorenzo. The thumping “Calm Down,” with help from Four Tet and Floating Points, is another tasty throwback to clubbing of that era, one that Katy seems comfortable with, considering the pounding single “Turn the Music Louder” with KDA.

Though some of the slower tracks, like “Chase Me” drift a bit, “Honey” shows how versatile Katy’s voice can be, as well as how well she can spot dance music talent, pulling together this wide-ranging bunch of 19 collaborators and making it all sound so sweet.",27/04/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics gets Gates grant for oral malaria test,"A Medford company has received a $678,000 grant from a foundation led by Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates for a new malaria test, officials said Monday.

Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc. announced it would develop “the world’s first oral fluid/saliva point-of-care diagnostic test to simply and accurately identify individuals infected with all species of malaria” with funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The grant is the second awarded to the company by the foundation. A year ago, the business received between $300,000 and $400,000 for a rapid blood test for malaria.

That test “demonstrated the ability to detect malaria in individuals with low parasite densities using whole blood,” said Javan Esfandiari, Chembio’s chief science and technology officer. He also said the company’s successful development of a saliva test for HIV “provides optimism that we can apply the patented . . . [testing technology] toward the detection of malaria using oral fluid/saliva.”

Last year, there were 438,000 deaths around the world from malaria, primarily in Africa, and 214 million new cases, according to the World Health Organization.

The Gates Foundation has been working to combat the disease for some time.

NewsDay,Angry Beyoncé fans threaten to boycott Rachael Ray’s tacos after ‘Lemonade’ album drop,"It didn’t take long for the hive to start swarming, brandishing stingers and lemon-shaped emojis, ready to fight for their queen behind the comfort of their screens.

In droves, they searched the Internet for “her,” the woman Beyonce accused of stealing husband Jay Z in a song on the singer’s latest album “Lemonade,” which dropped online Saturday night.

Clues from their queen were scant, but enough to fuel speculation and gossip. Finally, Beyonce’s mysterious foe “Becky with the good hair” wasn’t just a lyric. She had a real life name.

Rachael Ray, that 30-minute-meal making home wrecker who loves posting photos of her sexy. . . artichoke burgers?

Oops. Wrong Rachael.

That didn’t stop the hive.

Blinded by loyalty and late-night angst, Beyonce’s fan base, apparently illiterate, mixed up some vowels in their hate-fueled Google search. Instead of finding their actual target, a woman whose name differs only slightly from the Food Network Star, they landed on poor Rachael Ray.

On Twitter, Instagram and even Facebook, the hive, ruthless and unrelenting, attacked.

Ray’s photos of sultry sandwiches and her 11-year-old dog Isaboo (in honor of National Pet Parent Day), were peppered with the most cutting of insults.

“Oh I loved hot chicken fajitas but I will never make them again after what you did you did to the Queen,” wrote one user.

“Never watchin ur show again Rachel u r a homewrecker!” wrote another.

One commenter, basking in the glory of his own analogy, said: “. . . you better cook up a new man b4 I roll up with beehive and sting your --- until you go into anaphylactic shock @rachaelray.”

Ouch.

Rachael Ray has not responded to the case of mistaken identity.

Beyonce’s album, a combination of visuals, spoken word and song, premiered as an HBO special Saturday and has been streaming exclusively on Tidal, which has limited subscribers. The album was supposed to be released on iTunes at midnight Sunday, reported the New York Times, but that never happened.

NewsDay,LI center offers young people drug to prevent HIV infection,"Uninfected young people who admit to unsafe sex practices are being prescribed a powerful prophylactic drug with the hope of preventing HIV infection, part of a new program at a Long Island treatment center.

The Northwell Health system’s Center for Young Adult, Adolescent and Pediatric HIV Care has received a $2 million grant from the New York State Department of Health’s AIDS Institute to help curb the spread of HIV among high-risk individuals in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens.

People from midteens through early 20s will be offered the prescription drug therapy called PReP, a combination therapy of two HIV drugs, which doctors say can prevent infection with the virus. The drug’s acronym stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis.

Dr. David Rosenthal, the center’s medical director, said the therapy is part of a larger push to dramatically drive down new HIV infections statewide by 2020.

Over the next five years, Rosenthal said, the grant will provide $400,000 annually, split between Queens and Long Island.

Two years ago, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued a three-point plan to end the AIDS epidemic in New York. Key among tenets in that resolution was a call for an all-out effort to reduce the number of new HIV infections. Rosenthal — and other doctors — think PReP is one way to do that, especially when vulnerable populations are treated.

In recent years, studies have shown that the leading age group developing HIV is made up of young people in their teens and early 20s. Most are homosexual young men, but young heterosexual women, many of them African-American and Hispanic, also are at risk, Rosenthal said.

“We’re unfortunately seeing an increase in young people who are not having safe sex, and the methods we have used for many years have not decreased new cases of HIV in young adults,” he said.

The pill therapy, which is taken daily, is sold under the name Truvada. Although used in the treatment of some people who are already infected, the medication was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012 to help prevent an HIV-negative person from contracting the virus from a positive partner.

“Basically this program is for individuals who are at high risk of developing HIV,” Rosenthal said. He noted that in addition to the drug therapy, patients also will be taught how to “navigate safe sex practices.”

Dr. Roy Steigbigel, an infectious disease specialist at Stony Brook University Hospital, said the drug therapy works, but not always.

“It’s one of the antiretrovirals, which inhibits the replication of HIV,” he said of the mechanism the drug uses to thwart infection.

Steigbigel said there are limitations to the drug’s effectiveness because numerous strains of HIV are highly resistant to many of the widely used medications. If someone contracts a resistant strain, PReP therapy will be of little use, he said.

Rosenthal noted that the treatment is a step in the right direction and will help lower the infection rate in a vulnerable population. He said the number of new HIV infections has been declining for people aged 25 and older.

On Long Island, there are nearly 6,000 people of all ages living with HIV infections. In Queens the estimate is 16,900, Rosenthal said, adding that his youngest patient is 15.",22/04/2016
NewsDay,Groundbreaking held for LGBT Center in Patchogue,"Advocates and officials who gathered Friday for the symbolic groundbreaking of an LGBT community center in Patchogue called the day “historic” and described the project as “one of its kind” in vision and scope.

The LGBT Center at 7 Crossway Blvd., expected to open in about a year, will house a range of health care, support, advocacy and community programs for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the village, Suffolk County and the region. It is planned as a “green” building of more than 20,000 square feet that will be designed to conserve energy.

“In putting this center together, we have thought about not only what our community needs now but what our community needs 15 years from now, too,” said David Kilmnick, chief executive of the nonprofit LGBT Network. “We are beyond thrilled that we are able to bring this to Long Island.”

A building formerly used as a day-care facility will be renovated to house part of the center. A multistory wing will be added to the structure.

The network plans to invest between $5 million and $7 million in the project, he said. The organization has received grants for $500,000 from The Calamus Foundation and $500,000 from the state’s Long Island Regional Economic Development Council, and expects to raise at least another $500,000 from supporters before financing.

Among issues the center will seek to address, Kilmnick told supporters, will be the “significant health disparities” faced by LGBT people, ranging from treatments for those affected by HIV and AIDS to interventions for young people experiencing depression.

The center will serve as a “drop-in” location for LGBT youth who are runaways and often move from one temporary habitation to another, giving them a place to find clothing, take showers, receive mail and get training, and also have a base while they search for jobs, organizers said.

With a three-story building, including a rooftop terrace, landscaped meditation area and children’s park, the center should be a gathering place that will help the network expand its role as “a home and voice for LGBT people,” Kilmnick said.

Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said the center is “a project of incredible significance” to the area.

Sammy Chu, chairman of the Long Island chapter of the United States Green Building Council, praised not only the environmentally conscious approach to building the center, but also the role it will play as “a monument to human dignity” in the county.

For Rona Sinz, the center will be a safe space to be herself as a transgender person.

“For me, it’s about being who and what I am,” said Sinz, 56, a Holbrook resident. “It’s being with people that appreciate me for who I am, people that aren’t going to tell me you have to be this way, or else.”",22/04/2016
NewsDay,Charlie Sheen being investigated by LAPD for allegedly threatening to have ex Brett Rossi killed,"Los Angeles police confirmed Wednesday that actor Charlie Sheen is the subject of a criminal investigation.

The Los Angeles Times said LAPD spokesman Officer Mike Lopez additionally confirmed that police visited Sheen’s home on March 31 as part of the investigation, and that a search warrant had been obtained. The spokesman could not state the nature of the investigation or the alleged victim.

Both Variety and The Hollywood Reporter said that according to tabloid reports, an audio recording appears to contain Sheen, 50, ranting that he would pay someone $20,000 to kill or harm former fiancee Scottine Ross, known professionally as adult-film star Brett Rossi.

The two began a relationship in November 2013, with the “Anger Management” and “Two and a Half Men” star proposing the following February. They announced eight months later that they had mutually agreed to call off the engagement, though Ross, 26, told People magazine Sheen had ended it with a text message to her.

In December, almost a month after Sheen announced publicly he was HIV positive, Ross filed a lawsuit claiming he had not disclosed the medical condition to her while they were together. “As a result of this exposure, [Ross] she has suffered serious emotional distress from a reasonable fear that she will contract HIV,” states the suit, which also alleges assault and battery.

“The scariest moment was when he pinned me to the wall and he went off on me, and he choked me to the point of where I almost passed out,” the suit also says, according to People, which obtained a copy. “I remember screaming to him, ‘Charlie, I can’t breathe. claims stop, please stop.’ And he just kept saying, ‘I’m going to . . . kill you,’ I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh my God, he’s going to kill me.’ And I think that was so scary to me because it was the first time I had admitted [it]to myself.”

Sheen’s attorney, Marty Singer, had no comment.",06/04/2016
NewsDay,Suffolk methadone treatment wait list keeps growing,"The waitlist for Suffolk County’s four methadone clinics has grown to more than 200 people, propelled by increasing abuse of heroin and other opiates, officials said.

Thomas Schmidt, clinic administrator for Suffolk’s Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program, said, “I wouldn’t tell anyone that they could get into treatment within a couple of days or even a couple of weeks if they called us.” Pregnant women and HIV patients do not have to wait, Schmidt said.

The Suffolk County health department said the waitlist first became necessary late last year.

Experts warn that delays in getting into treatment hamper the chances of recovery for addicts, and could contribute to overdoses.

“How long that window stays open for an addict to be willing to seek treatment could be a matter of hours, days — certainly not a matter of months,” said Jeffrey Reynolds, executive director of Family and Children’s Association, a Mineola nonprofit that offers drug recovery programs.

“It seems crazy that we wouldn’t find a way to get them help sooner,” Reynolds said.

Nassau County health officials say they have experienced an increase in demand for treatment, and that the county methadone clinic in East Meadow treats about 540 people.

Nassau officials say they have not had to turn to a waitlist in part because they also administer two other forms of anti-addiction medications, Suboxone and Vivitrol. The latter is given by injection and requires only monthly visits to county clinics. Nassau’s proximity to New York City also means some addicts are likely to seek treatment there, according to some local addiction specialists.

Suffolk has started a Vivitrol pilot program for addicts at the county jail in Riverhead, Schmidt said.

Treatment of last resort

Methadone, a highly regulated narcotic, has been used for decades to wean addicts off opioids. The drug, usually taken daily, reduces withdrawal symptoms without causing the high associated with heroin and prescription painkillers. It typically is the treatment of last resort for users who have failed repeatedly at other types of withdrawal programs, according to experts.

The four Suffolk County methadone clinics in Huntington, Riverhead and Hauppauge are at capacity with a total of about 1,100 clients, county health officials said. New treatment slots become available as people leave the program.

But the long-term nature of methadone treatment, which can take months or years depending on the client, means new openings are limited to a handful each month.

Last month, Suffolk hired two clinic workers in hopes of whittling down the list, and plans to hire at least two more in the coming months, Schmidt said.

Social service advocates expressed concern that those measures may fall short given the need.

Last year, there were 103 fatal heroin overdoses in Suffolk, according to preliminary county data. The figure is expected to rise, as the county also had another 126 possible fatal drug overdoses for which the cause of death has not been determined. In 2014, there were a record 109 heroin overdose deaths in Suffolk.

Nassau had 58 fatal heroin overdoses last year, compared with 53 in 2014, according to county data.

Anthony Rizzuto, a program coordinator at Seafield Center, a private Westhampton Beach addiction treatment center, said the county’s waitlist highlights the challenges addicts face getting into treatment programs. Inpatient detoxification programs in both counties often turn away patients for lack of beds, Rizzuto said.

Last month, the state Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services launched an “availability dashboard” on its website that allows people to find bed openings throughout the state in real time.

Suffolk previously used a telephone lottery system to admit new clients into the methadone program. People were instructed to call on Mondays for the chance to arrange intake appointments to determine if they were eligible.

‘Too many people calling’

Schmidt said the old system frustrated addicts, with many calling week after week without success, with no way of estimating how long it would take to secure a spot.

“We were seeing that the numbers were getting harder to manage,” Schmidt said. “It just got to the point that too many people were calling and everyone started to feel the strain of it.”

The waitlist seeks to address some of those frustrations, by allowing people to track their place in line, so they can seek other types of treatment until they are notified a slot has become available, Schmidt said. Addicts who want county methadone treatment must prove they have failed at other types of drug withdrawal programs.

Officials in Suffolk and Nassau say they hope to address the need for more detoxification programs by partnering with three nonprofit mental health clinics that received state approval last year to offer medically supervised outpatient programs.

In Suffolk, the program is run jointly by Central Nassau Guidance and Horizons Counseling in Hauppauge. In Nassau, the program is offered by Counseling Service of EDNY in Hempstead, and in Hicksville by Central Nassau Guidance.

“We can get people in, they can come into the program, detox under medical supervision . . . and during that time, they’re engaging in treatment,” said Jeffrey Stein, executive director of Central Nassau Guidance “There are no gaps.”

Linda Ventura of Kings Park, who founded Thomas’ Hope, a foundation that promotes drug awareness and prevention, called on Suffolk and state officials to increase funding for opioid withdrawal programs. Ventura, whose son Thomas died of an overdose in 2012 at age 21, has traveled to Albany with other parent activists to draw attention to the obstacles facing addicts who want to get into treatment.

Although Thomas Ventura never attempted to receive methadone treatment, he attended several other types of rehabilitation programs, and often had to wait for beds to become available, or for approval from his health insurance provider.

“No one should be waiting,” Ventura said.",03/04/2016

NewsDay,Feeding infants peanut butter in new proposed guidelines,"It might seem unorthodox, but feeding peanuts to infants at risk of an allergic reaction could actually safeguard them.

Mounting evidence suggests that gradually introducing bits of peanut protein, such as peanut butter diluted with hot water, to high-risk babies as young as 4 months old might help them develop immunity. (Whole peanuts, however, are a choking hazard and should not be fed to babies and toddlers.)

The latest research, published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine, found most children who consume peanuts at an early age will remain allergy-free, even if they stop eating peanuts by age 6.

Now, the National Institutes of Health is proposing new guidelines recommending some children be fed peanut-containing foods — about 6 to 7 grams over three or more feedings — as early as age 4 to 6 months. The recommendation applies to children who are at high risk because they already have severe eczema, egg allergy or both.

Food allergies appear to be increasingly common — they now affect about 1.4 percent of U.S. children, according to a 2010 study by food allergists with Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. That figure is up from less than 0.5 percent in 1999.

There are a handful of theories for the rise — such as the one that says children are not being exposed to as many germs so their immune systems have changed — but no definitive explanation.

For some, eating cross-contaminated food or even consuming traces of peanuts, which can lurk undetected on countertops and on people’s hands, can be life-threatening. The consequences aren’t always so severe — sometimes exposure results in hives or a tingling sensation.

Parents were once advised to delay introduction of peanuts into their children’s diets to avoid a dangerous reaction. But, for some, that thinking has shifted.

“If you delay too long, you have a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy,” said Dr. David Fleischer, an allergy specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado who helped write the NIH guidelines.

However, the recommendations, which aren’t yet final, say those at highest risk should first get a skin prick test exposing them to a small amount of the allergen. Depending on how allergic the child is, the feeding might be best supervised or avoided.

The proposed guidelines draw upon the results of a clinical trial in the U.K., published last spring in the New England Journal of Medicine. Known as the LEAP trial, it involved 640 infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. They were divided into two groups, one with families avoiding peanuts and another with children fed peanut butter weekly for five years. Nearly 14 percent of those who avoided peanuts became allergic, compared with 2 percent of those who didn’t.

Research published in the journal this month built upon the LEAP study, using the same group of children. This time, every participant avoided eating peanuts for one year. After that 12-month hiatus, 4.8 percent of participants who had been exposed to peanuts as infants developed allergies compared to 18.6 percent from the original avoidance group of infants, researchers said.

“The majority of people feel that this sounds good in theory, and we know that for some people this has worked,” said Louise Larsen of California, whose daughter, now 19, had a sever reaction to nuts at 15 months. “But for many of us, our children would never have survived being introduced to peanuts, because their first introduction to peanuts was severe anaphylaxis.

“We hope that these new guidelines heavily stress the importance of early testing to weed out babies that might have an anaphylactic reaction,” she added.",31/03/2016
NewsDay,"Melville man pleads guilty in HIV drug scheme, officials say","A Melville man pleaded guilty Tuesday for his role in a scheme to sell illegally obtained antiretroviral medication to hundreds of unsuspecting HIV-positive New Yorkers, authorities said.

Glenn Schabel, 55, served as both the supervising pharmacist and compliance officer for MOMS Pharmacy, formerly of Melville. He pleaded guilty in state Supreme Court in Riverhead to criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions in the first degree and commercial bribe receiving in the first degree. Both are felonies.

Authorities said Schabel admitted he accepted more than $5 million in bribes on behalf of MOMS Pharmacy and “received prescription medication from sellers that he knew or had reasonable grounds to know were not authorized by law to sell.”

Schabel faces up to 7 years in state prison and must forfeit $5.5 million to the New York State Medicaid Program, authorities said. He pleaded guilty on behalf of his company, Glenn Schabel Inc., to money laundering in the first degree. As a result of his guilty pleas, Schabel will surrender his pharmacist license.

Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, who announced the plea Tuesday, said the convictions were part of his Medicaid Fraud Control Unit’s Operation Black-Market Meds investigation.

“This defendant, a licensed pharmacist, abused the public’s trust and became a participant in this multimillion dollar scheme that at its core preyed on the sick,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “My office will continue to protect taxpayers and consumers from schemes that threaten the safety of the public.”

Schabel was arrested in April 2012, along with three others, accused of using a network of bogus prescription medication wholesalers in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and California to launder money and sell more than $274 million in diverted prescription medications.

Ten companies were charged and 10 drugs were involved, including Truvada, Atripla and Reyataz. All are listed by the Food and Drug Administration as commonly prescribed HIV treatments.

The medications were obtained from illegal or unknown sources and moved through Allion Healthcare, Inc., the parent company of MOMS Pharmacy, Schneiderman said.

The medications were obtained by Schabel’s co-defendants using “various illegal means and included pills that had been previously dispensed to other individuals and that were then resold into the black market,” according to Schneiderman.

Those diverted medications were purchased by MOMS Pharmacy and dispensed to its patients, many of whom were Medicaid recipients, the attorney general’s office said, adding that the New York State Medicaid program reimbursed MOMS Pharmacy more than $150 million for the drugs.

The pills, dispensed between 2008 and 2012, posed “a serious health risk to the public” because of their unknown origin and quality, and some were counterfeit, expired, mislabeled or not properly stored, the attorney general’s office said.

Among the agencies taking part in the investigation were the New York State Office of the Medicaid inspector general, the Alabama Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the FBI, DEA and the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Schneiderman said.",29/03/2016

Beach Hut awarded

concession contracts

The Babylon Town Board has awarded food concessions through 2020 at Cedar and Overlook beaches, Venetian Shores Park and Tanner Park to Beach Hut, the current provider.

The company and its principal, Fred Marsilio, sell food at seven locations in the town and across Suffolk County.

In Babylon Town, Beach Hut pays a flat fee and a portion of gross proceeds for the concession. In 2015, the company paid the town a flat fee of $35,000 plus $94,264.91 off gross sales of $2,065,298.

The contract may be extended by up to 15 years after 2020.

Records show that Beach Hut has donated $24,500 to local Democratic causes since 2006, almost all to the Babylon Town Democratic Committee and to Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone when he was Babylon Town supervisor.

The company also donated $300 in 2015 to Legis. Monica Martinez (D-Brentwood), deputy town supervisor Tony Martinez’s sister. Neither of the other two companies who applied for the concession, J&B Partners Top Flight Foods and Simply Unique Caterers, gave money.

Town Supervisor Rich Schaffer, who also serves as chairman of the Suffolk County Democratic Committee, said the decision to award the concession was made by a committee of town officials who used a point system to score the concession applicants. Factors included the fees the applicants were prepared to pay the town and the ability to serve residents at multiple locations.

“They scored highest. It wasn’t even close,” said Schaffer of Beach Hut, adding that the company has provided “great service” in the past.

AMITYVILLE

Village budget draft

has 1.05% tax hike

Amityville Village trustee Nick LaLota last week unveiled a $15.7 million draft budget for 2016-2017 that would rely on a 1.05 percent tax levy increase while setting aside $450,000 for capital projects and the village’s contingency fund.

“For the first time in eight years this village has a positive fund balance and this budget will add to that,” said LaLota, the village budget officer, calling the plan “balanced and responsible.”

The property tax levy would be $35.04 per $100 of assessed valuation, bringing the bill for a $375,000 house to $4,258 from $4,198. Village residents do not pay a Suffolk County police district tax.

The tax increase would conform to the state-imposed property tax cap for the fourth consecutive year.

Police spending, the largest portion of the budget, accounts for $7.9 million of the total and would fund a new police officer and a new cruiser.

Other items under consideration for the spending plan include a new pickup truck for the Department of Public Works, road repair and a new roof for the Mill Street firehouse.

“It’s not easy to comply with the tax cap, keep or grow village services and maintain strong fiscal health for the village, and we feel very proud that we’re doing all three,” LaLota said in an interview Friday.

GLEN COVE

Hydrant flush could

affect water pressure

The Glen Cove Water Department will flush 85 fire hydrants around the city in April, which could cause a brief period of water pressure fluctuation and water discoloration for some residents.

The city flushes fire hydrants on dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs twice a year to clean out rust particles and fine sand, public works director James Byrne said. The sediments build up because the piping ends, so water isn’t flowing continuously.

City workers will open the hydrants and run the water at full pressure — usually for 15 to 20 minutes — until the sediments are cleared, Byrne said.

During that time, residents may notice low pressure at times or, for residents who live near one of the hydrants being flushed, brownish water. The water is safe to drink, Byrne said.

The flushing will continue throughout the month and is designed to remove sediments before the water system’s peak usage period, during the summer. The fire hydrants also are flushed in October, city spokeswoman Lisa Travatello said.

For more information, call the water department at 516-676-5096.

MINEOLA

Legal clinic available

for homeowners

Nassau residents struggling with possibly losing their homes in mortgage foreclosure, or who have issues from superstorm Sandy, can seek help twice in April from volunteer attorneys at the Legal Consultation Clinics of the Nassau County Bar Association in Mineola.

The first clinic is next Monday; the other, April 18. Both are from 3 to 6 p.m. at the bar association on the corner of West and 15th streets. It is a couple of blocks south of the bus and train stations.

Nassau County homeowners concerned about foreclosure can meet with a volunteer attorney for a free consultation and may be directed for additional help with different agencies, some of which may be represented on site.

Many Sandy-related questions can also be answered at the clinics.

There are no income restrictions to attend the clinic.

Bilingual attorneys fluent in Spanish will be on site, and those with other languages — including Russian, Haitian Creole, Korean, Chinese, Hindi and American Sign Language — may be requested when making reservations, said a news release from the bar association.

To make an appointment, call 516-747-4070.

HEMPSTEAD

Minority health fair

on Hofstra campus

Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano, Health Commissioner Dr. Lawrence Eisenstein and Hofstra University will partner in their 3rd Annual Nassau County Minority Health Fair on April 7.

This event, from 12:45 p.m. to 2:45 p.m., is in the Hofstra University Mack Student Center, Multipurpose Room, North Campus, and is free and open to the public. It celebrates National Public Health Week, which is April 4-10, and its goal is to increase awareness of public health issues and chronic disease prevention.

“I am honored to participate ... in celebrating Public Health Week,” Mangano said.

“This is one of many collaborative events that assist us in addressing health disparities in Nassau County,” Eisenstein said.

Associate professor and director of Hofstra’s master of public health program, Dr. Corinne Kyriacou, said partnering with the county helps attendees better understand the unique suburban context of the public health issues being addressed.

“Health promotion programs must be tailored to meet the specific needs of the communities they are intended to help,” she said.

Attendees will have the opportunity to speak with local health professionals, obtain voluntary hearing, blood pressure, vision, dental and HIV screenings, and participate in exercise and healthy food demonstrations.

Earlier events that day include a discussion of the politics of food and soda with internationally known author and researcher, Dr. Marion Nestle, from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., and an interdisciplinary student film competition focusing on the Healthy People 2020 goals, from 11:10 a.m. to 12:25 p.m.

BABYLON VILLAGE

No property tax hike

in $10M draft budget

Babylon Village trustees last week unveiled a $10.3 million draft budget with no property tax increase.

That plan would freeze the tax rate at $14.93 per $100 of assessed valuation and keep the village under the state-imposed tax levy increase cap if trustees approve it at a public hearing next Monday at 7 p.m. at Village Hall.

But Mayor Ralph Scordino in an interview repeated warnings that what he called unduly tight fiscal constraints will eventually impact village services. “Sooner or later, it is going to impact what you see around the village,” he said. “It may not happen in my lifetime as mayor, but I’m sure that whoever takes over is going to be burdened by it.”

In what is becoming almost a yearly custom, Scordino, who also serves as president of the Suffolk County Village Officials Association, again called for a re-evaluation of the tax cap program and what he said was a proliferation of unfunded mandates from state government.

“The governor should take a closer look at this,” he said.

Village officials have scrambled to fund road reconstruction and equipment purchases like a payloader this year, he said.

The spending plan also calls for $100,000 to be set aside in a contingency fund.

To balance next year’s budget, officials will apply $237,000 in unspent funds from the current year and an expected $425,000 in FEMA reimbursements, the last they expect to receive for dock and pool repairs they ordered after superstorm Sandy.

Trustees have also increased fees for a broad range of village services and licenses, charging more, for example, to golf at the municipal course or take wedding photographs at Argyle Lake.

Shared services with neighboring municipalities will also offer some savings, Scordino said. “If you compare how much we save to how much it costs to redo a road, it’s fractional, it’s minuscule,” he said.

EAST HAMPTON

Springs home to get reinspected by town

The case of a Springs woman charged with operating her single-family home as a resort in a residential neighborhood was adjourned yesterday to allow for a reinspection of the premises by town officials on Thursday.

A new May 2 date in East Hampton Town Justice Court has been set for a hearing on the matter.

In September, Leanna Erdmann, of 160 Red Dirt Rd., was cited by the town for 26 alleged violations, including converting a garage and an artist’s studio into additional living space without the required permits, inspections and approvals; having no building permits or certificates of occupancy for completed renovations; having open pool gates without self-closing and latching mechanisms; and lacking a required pool alarm and a code-compliant pool barrier.

Erdmann has denied the charges, but Betsy Bambrick, East Hampton’s code enforcement director, has said investigators built their case against Erdmann with information gathered from social media and online advertising.

Town Attorney Michael Sendlenski said after yesterday’s adjournment that code enforcement and building department inspectors will go to the property on Thursday to see if in fact all of the alleged violations have been taken care of.

“They claim to be in compliance,” Sendlenski said of the defense.

Erdmann’s attorney, William Grigo of Southampton, could not immediately be reached for comment following yesterday’s court proceeding.

NewsDay,6 AIDS activists arrested in Capitol protesting Cuomo’s budget,"ALBANY — Six activists were arrested at the State Capitol Monday while urging Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to boost state spending dedicated to assisting those with AIDS and reducing the number of new cases.

About 150 AIDS and HIV activists parked themselves in a room just down the corridor from Cuomo’s office on the second floor of the State Capitol, reading aloud the names of 100,000 AIDS victims. They said Cuomo last year promised $200 million in state funding, but his office later clarified it would be paid over five years. Activists want $70 million included in this year’s budget, especially for housing assistance.

Cuomo has proposed adding $10 million in new funding for AIDS/HIV, although his office says the budget proposal includes $2.5 billion a year it spends to combat AIDS.

“We want to send the message that we need a significant investment to eliminate homelessness and housing insecurity for people living with HIV to reach our 2020 goal,” said Jason Walker, an HIV organizer with VOCAL-NY of Brooklyn.

Volunteers planned to return to the room at 7 a.m. Tuesday. About 25 had planned to stay overnight. The six were arrested for remaining in the building after its 7 p.m. close. .

The governor’s budget is due Thursday at midnight.

Cuomo has said his plan aims to reduce infections to 750 per year by 2020, down from 3,200 cases in 2013. It includes expanded testing and treatment, as well as increased housing and services.

“No one is more committed to ending HIV/AIDS than Gov. Cuomo, who with a $2.5 billion annual investment, has made New York State a national leader by pledging to end the epidemic by 2020 and providing quality support services to those impacted by the disease,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said in an email. “The budget process is ongoing and the governor looks forward to productive discussions with both houses as we address a variety of issues including the End AIDS initiative.”",28/03/2016
NewsDay,Conservation group seeks protections for bumblebee species,"Without federal protection, a bumblebee native to the Northeast may soon disappear from farms and gardens — and the consequences could be dire, a conservation group warns.

Defenders of Wildlife has petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the yellow-banded bumblebee, which has declined sharply in New York and other Northeastern states, under the Endangered Species Act.

“This category of bumblebees is really on the ropes,” said Jay Tutchton, an attorney with the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. Bumblebees are vital pollinators for many crops, including those grown on Long Island, experts say.

“Bees are actually a very easy species to make the argument for, because they do so much that’s valuable for humanity,” Tutchton said.

While bee populations overall have plummeted nationwide, experts say the yellow-banded bumblebee has been especially hard-hit in the last 10 years. Causes include use of harmful pesticides, diseases ravaging commercial colonies, climate change and loss of habitat to development.

According to a recent state Department of Environmental Conservation report, “There are few records of this species located in [New York] since 2009 ... despite increased survey effort. There is evidence of sharp decline in the population both short-term and long-term.”

Entomologist Daniel Gilrein with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County said he knows of only one recorded spotting of the yellow-banded bee on Long Island in recent years; in Orient in 2013.

“It’s a very serious decline of this cornerstone population. They are critically needed as pollinators for fruits, vegetables, crops, flowers, and the main culprit seems to be pesticides and climate change,” said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment based in Farmingdale. “You can get to a point where the species is not able to recover, so right now we’re at the crossroads. We need to stop using these pesticides; we need to allow more areas of open field for a lot of species to recover.”

Big and fuzzy, the yellow-banded bee is native to the Northeast, and used to be easily found east of the Rockies in northern states and southern Canada.

Today, the bee has largely disappeared from the southern reaches of its territory, said Rich Hatfield, senior conservation biologist with the Xerces Society, a nonprofit seeking to protect butterflies, bees and other invertebrates.

He called the bee an “excellent pollinator” of fruits, vegetables and flowers.

“The species can fly when it’s cold and wet out, so it’s out there doing work when the honey bees are staying warm in their hives,” Hatfield said.

In its petition to have the yellow-banded and Western bumblebees listed as endangered species, Defenders of Wildlife cited studies in several areas in the Northeast where bumblebees used to be abundant but are now scarcely found. According to the Fish and Wildlife Service website, other pollinators, including the Monarch butterfly and other bumblebee species, are also under review to be listed under the Endangered Species Act.

“When we’re talking about pollinators, we’re really talking about human food security,” Hatfield said. “Bees provide around one-third of the food we eat, so without bees our nutritious and delicious foods disappear.”

The rapid decline of bee populations and its consequences have been in the public eye for close to a decade, since colony collapse disorder made headlines for the fact that it was cutting down honey bees by the millions.

Fish and Wildlife agreed with many of Defenders of Wildlife claims made in its September filing, and was persuaded in its initial review that commercial agriculture, urbanization, climate change, pesticides and disease have posed serious threats to the yellow-banded bumblebee. The agency is now conducting a more thorough review.

If listed, a federal recovery plan for the species would be developed that could ban activities or practices deemed harmful.",28/03/2016
NewsDay,Port Jefferson doctor who refused to do biopsy on HIV patient settles,"A Port Jefferson doctor has agreed to pay $75,000 and attend discrimination training after refusing to conduct a biopsy on an HIV-positive patient, federal officials said on Wednesday.

The office of Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said that Dr. William Sher, an otolaryngologist, settled claims under the Americans With Disabilities Act for canceling the scheduled biopsy with a patient identified only by his initials “J.P.”

Capers said in a news release that the biopsy of a neck growth was called off “minutes before the procedure was to begin,” and three weeks later the growth was found to be cancerous when another doctor performed the biopsy.

Although Sher agreed to pay $75,000 and attend training on the disabilities act and discrimination based on HIV or AIDS status, he did not admit to violating JP’s rights, Capers’ office said. Sher did not immediately respond to a message left at his office.

“The ADA requires that doctors and other health care professionals provide appropriate care and treatment to patients without regard to their HIV status,” Capers said.

That suit is still pending, according to court records.",09/03/2016
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics losses widen in fourth quarter,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Tuesday reported a higher loss for the October-December period compared with a year ago because of lower sales of its rapid tests for infectious diseases.

The Medford-based manufacturer said it lost $650,000 in the final three months of 2015 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the same quarter of 2014.

Sales fell 38 percent, year over year, to $4.4 million.

Chief executive John J. Sperzel III blamed the larger loss on sales declines in Brazil and Mexico of Chembio’s point-of-care tests for HIV and syphilis. He predicted a stronger performance this year in part because of a new Zika test that the company is developing.

“While the company continues to strengthen its sexually-transmitted disease business, we are also building robust product pipelines in two new areas: fever disease and technology collaborations, and we have been very successful executing our strategy to obtain grant-based or partner-based funding for these projects,” Sperzel said.

Chembio has secured more than $2.5 million from a charitable foundation begun by Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen to develop rapid tests for Zika, Ebola and other fever diseases. The company also received funding from another Microsoft founder, Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, to develop malaria tests.

Sperzel said, “We believe our new fever disease portfolio and technology collaborations will pave the way for future growth.”

The company has worked with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and similar groups in foreign countries.

For the full year, Chembio’s losses more than doubled to $2.4 million compared with $1.1 million in 2014.

Sales for the 12-month period fell 12 percent to $24.3 million compared with 2014.

NewsDay,"Chembio says Zika test applied to Brazil, U.S. specimens","A Medford company has begun trying out its rapid test for the Zika virus on “clinical specimens” from six countries, including Brazil and the United States, officials said Monday.

“Preliminary testing results are highly encouraging,” said Javan Esfandiari, chief science and technology officer at Chembio Diagnostics Inc.

He also said the local company is developing its point-of-care tests with Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation that is responsible for developing vaccines and diagnostic tools for Brazil’s public health system.

Chembio has worked with Bio-Manguinhos for the past 12 years on blood tests for HIV, syphilis, Leishmaniasis (a parasitic disease) and other illnesses, Esfandiari said.

Last month, Chembio announced it had won a $550,000 grant from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to develop rapid tests for Zika. Allen is a co-founder of computer software giant Microsoft Corp.

Zika is spread by mosquitoes and was first identified in 1947. Recently, outbreaks of the virus in French Polynesia and Brazil have been tentatively linked with women giving birth to babies with microcephaly — or unusually small heads — and brain damage.

Chembio is developing a stand-alone test to detect Zika and another to detect Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika also will be added to a six-virus blood test that is in development and received $2.1 million last year from the Paul G. Allen Ebola Program.

Chembio chief executive John J. Sperzel said, “We hope to receive additional funding to accelerate the development and testing. It is essential that government, industry and regulatory agencies work together to address the global health emergencies posed by emerging diseases such as Zika virus.”

The company made its announcement before Monday’s stock market opening. Chembio shares closed up 15 cents, or about 3 percent, to $5.69 on the Nasdaq market.

NewsDay,"Charlie Sheen, Whoopi Goldberg to star in ‘Nine Eleven,’ film about World Trade Center attacks","Charlie Sheen and Whoopi Goldberg will star in a film about five people trapped in a World Trade Center elevator during the 9/11 terrorist attack.

Variety reported Monday that production has begun on the independently produced action-drama, titled “Nine Eleven,” which also features Luis Guzmán (CBS’ “Code Black”), Wood Harris (“Ant-Man,” “Creed”) and Olga Fonda (“Real Steel,” The CW’s “The Vampire Diaries”).

Former “Anger Management” star Sheen, 50 — who revealed in November that he had been HIV-positive for four years and has maintained a successful medical regimen — said in a statement to Variety, “I feel deeply connected to the material and I’m so excited to be working with my dear friend Whoopi Goldberg.”

The two previously appeared in separate scenes in the 1993 “Lethal Weapon” parody “National Lampoon’s Loaded Weapon 1,” in which Sheen played a valet and Goldberg went unbilled as police officer Sgt. Billy York, former partner of the lead character, played by Sheen’s brother, Emilio Estevez.

Sheen’s manager, Mark Burg, is an executive producer of “Nine Eleven,” which is being shot entirely at Thunder Studios in Long Beach, California. That facility is producing the film with Sprockefeller Pictures, Vitamin A Films and Sunset Pictures, according to Variety.

Director Martin Guigui, who has made seven low-budget features since 1999, co-wrote the script with Steven Golebiowski, who is making his feature debut after creating the Syfy reality TV series “Haunted Collector.”

“We are fortunate to have such a gifted cast on board,” Guigui said in a statement to Variety. “Both Charlie and Whoopi are native New Yorkers who strongly identify with this story.”",07/03/2016

NewsDay,Charlie Sheen: Testosterone cream to blame for erratic ‘Tiger Blood’ behavior,"Charlie Sheen says his often bizarre behavior in recent years was due in part to medication.

In an interview for Wednesday’s “The Dr. Oz Show,” the actor, 50, explains how after being fired from his sitcom “Two and a Half Men” in March 2011, following months of contentious behavior and rehab, he went through “a very specific period of time that did feel very out-of-body and very just detached from all things real, you know? I felt superhuman during some of that,” he told host Dr. Mehmet Oz, adding, “It was a lot of highs and lows.”

Of his highly public drug- and alcohol-fueled incidents and pronouncements during that time and afterward, Sheen says, “I was taking a lot of testosterone cream” — used to treat low testosterone levels in men — “and I think I went too far with it. So it was kind of, like, a borderline, not a ’roid rage, but a ’roid disengage,” alluding to the lack of impulse control that can be caused by anabolic steroids. Testosterone is the main such hormone produced by the male body, though synthetic steroids abound among athletes and others to artificially promote muscle density.

His behavior at the time — including during a national tour of an idiosyncratic stage show, “My Violent Torpedo of Truth / Defeat Is Not an Option” — now makes him “cringe a little bit,” Sheen says. “There were things about that person that were empowering, that were vibrant, that . . . [made me feel] alive, whether or not I was in some suspended state or not, but I didn’t like the anger. I tend to be victimized by my anger at times.”

NewsDay,Breast milk donations accepted at new Long Island milk depot,"A milk depot — where breast-feeding moms can drop off excess breast milk to be shipped to a milk bank that distributes it to babies in need — is set to open on Long Island on Feb. 23. It’s the first milk depot in Nassau and Suffolk counties, says Dr. Lauren Macaluso, a pediatrician with Allied Physicians Group in New Hyde Park.

The nonprofit depot will be located at Macaluso’s medical office. Women who want to donate breast milk will first go through a screening procedure that includes being tested for HIV and other infectious diseases and making sure that they don’t smoke or use illegal drugs. Women collect their milk at home. “When they bring it to me, it’s already pumped,” Macaluso said.

The milk initially will be sent to the Mothers’ Milk Bank of Ohio to be distributed, for instance, to premature babies whose mothers can’t produce enough milk on their own, says Macaluso, who also is a certified lactation consultant and who specializes in breast-feeding issues in her practice.

“What we are trying to do by creating milk depots is get more mothers into the system,” Macaluso says. “Human milk is the norm for human feeding. The thought is the more access points for women to drop milk off, the more milk we can get to infants who need it.”

Once a milk bank opens in New York State, the ultimate goal is “to have New York milk for New York babies,” Macaluso says. A milk bank is in the process of being established in Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester County and should open by May, says Julie Bouchet-Horwitz, executive director of The New York Milk Bank.

Milk banks pasteurize milk once they receive it; a prescription is required to receive donor milk, Bouchet-Horwitz says. Milk banks sell the breast milk to hospitals or directly to women who need it to cover the costs of the process, she says. Hospitals often absorb the cost for babies while they are hospitalized; insurance companies don’t routinely reimburse for breast milk in New York, so if a baby still needs breast milk after being discharged from the hospital the parents have to pay for it themselves, she says. The New York Milk Bank will charge $4.50 per ounce plus shipping, Bouchet-Horwitz says, adding that premature babies drink far fewer ounces per day than a full-term newborn.

Christina Mouroulis, 37, of Williston Park, is in the process of applying to donate milk and is thrilled a depot will open “a hop and a skip away.” Mouroulis, mom of James, 3, and Lucas, 6 months, says she produces more than enough milk to feed Lucas. “I would never throw away milk,” she says. “The fact that I can help whichever baby needs it just feels great. The benefits of breast feeding are amazing.”

The milk depot essentially entails a freezer located at Macaluso’s office and staff certified to handle and ship the milk product, Macaluso says.

NewsDay,"Kanye West says he had Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian’s ‘blessing’ for ‘Famous’ lyric","Is there bad blood again between Taylor Swift and Kanye West?

The controversial rapper, who performed the song “Famous” from his upcoming album “The Life of Pablo” at Madison Square Garden Thursday, had the Twitterverse in a frenzy thanks to one line in the song which made reference to the pop diva. “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that [expletive] famous.”

This marks the latest incident in the strange history between the two performers, which began when West interrupted her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. She later wrote a song about the incident, and they reconciled in public last year.

It’s still unclear whether Swift had signed off on the song. According to TMZ, Swift had seen the lyrics and had approved them. However, a spokesperson for the singer gave a statement to The New York Times’ music critic Jon Caramanica claiming that Swift was not happy about West’s song. Meanwhile, West has been tweeting incessantly in defense of the song.

“I did not diss Taylor Swift and I’ve never dissed her,” West tweeted. “First thing is I’m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship. . . . 2nd thing I asked my wife for her blessings and she was cool with it. . . . 3rd thing I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.”

He also described his misogynistic reference to Swift as a hip-hop term of endearment and claimed the line was her idea.

Swift has not responded, though model Gigi Hadid, a member of Swift’s squad who attended West’s event, tweeted support for her friend. “My attendance somewhere does not mean I agree with everything being said in the music playing there. My friends know of my loyalty,” she wrote.

Meanwhile, West’s album, which was supposed to drop Friday, Feb. 12, was delayed. According to reports, Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical CEO who made headlines last year for raising the prices of a drug taken by HIV patients, is offering West and his record company $10 million for the new album.

West tweeted Friday morning about “The Life of Pablo”: “The album is being mastered and will be out today… added on a couple of tracks…”",12/02/2016
NewsDay,Shinnecock Nation OKs developing medical marijuana program,"The Shinnecock Indian Nation has approved two resolutions that will allow the tribe to move forward with an outside developer to cultivate and sell medical marijuana.

In a 83 to 34 vote Saturday, the tribe approved an ordinance paving the way for development of cultivation and dispensary facilities on the tribe’s Southampton reservation. The tribe also voted 80 to 34 to approve working with an outside firm to help develop and finance the enterprise, said Bryan Polite, chairman of the tribal trustees, the nation’s governing body.

Polite said the tribe expects to open a facility sometime this year. It would be Long Island’s third, with two operating in Lake Success and Riverhead. A spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Polite said the tribe hadn’t decided precisely where on the Southampton reservation the new facilities would be located. “We’re looking at different locations,” he said.

Tribal sources said the Shinnecock Nation is working on the venture with Conor Green Consulting, a Chicago-based company whose website says it is “guiding the way through the medical cannabis industry.” A call to Conor Green wasn’t returned.

The website lists two company officials, Lawrence R. Lucas and Prentice M. Salter, who are also listed as chairman and chief executive, respectively, of Conor Sports LLC., which markets social-media sports games. Salter’s online resume lists him as a former official with casino Super Resorts (Macao) Ltd., and the Venetian Macao Ltd., as well as the N9ne Group at the Palms Casino Resort.

It’s unclear whether the tribe’s work with Conor Green on the medical marijuana initiative will extend into gaming ventures. The Shinnecock tribe had worked extensively following its 2010 federal recognition to negotiate one or more casinos on Long Island and in New York City. But local politics, tribal divisions and a break with developer Gateway Casino Resorts of Detroit shelved the efforts.

More recently, the tribe is said by sources to be exploring lower-level gaming on the reservation. Polite declined to discuss the topic.

The tribe expects to have from 40 to 60 members working at the marijuana cultivation and dispensary operations, and up to 100 new jobs in total would be created.

Polite said the tribe, which has been working on a medical marijuana initiative since May, will follow and even exceed guidelines in the New York State Compassionate Care Act for regulating the business. The act, passed by the State Legislature in June 2014, legalized use of nonsmokable forms of the drug, including pills, vapors, tinctures and oils for those with specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS and Lou Gehrig’s disease.",08/02/2016

NewsDay,Did I contribute to today’s drug epidemic?,"Thirteen years ago, I started a pharmaceutical sales career for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, peddling samples out of my bag near the lush beautiful beaches of Newport and Laguna beaches in California. I threw ornate dinners for local psychiatrists to boost the sales of Effexor XR for depression and anxiety, even though it was clear that the physicians I sold to - the “pain docs” - prescribed Effexor off-label for pain.

Almost a decade later, I parked my sporty Infiniti company car in Beverly Hills and traded my $200,000-plus salary, which I was then receiving from a boutique firm called Medicis, for a used epidemiology textbook at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, where I started a master of public health program in 2011. What I did not realize at the time was that my own actions in closing a drug sale, without any bioethical considerations of what I was doing, helped contribute to the over prescription of powerful psychotropic drugs much like that of OxyContin, a powerful pain killer.

While the pharmaceutical industry is typically looked to as the public’s life raft when health epidemics arise, it is one of the major culprits of the addiction epidemic. Prescription-drug-induced mortalities have surpassed car crash fatalities for the first time, as primary care physicians overprescribe opiates and patients abuse them. I was made aware of this new American epidemic almost two years ago when I attended a town hall at my alma mater on “prescription drug abuse.” It was hosted by former President Bill Clinton, who told a story of two young men he had known who died as a result of opioid painkillers.

It’s not just the prescription drugs that are the problems, though. Opiates are also the gateway for street heroin; in fact, three quarters of heroin addicts started their addictions with pain pills. According to NPR, between 2007 and 2013, there has been a 150 percent increase in heroin use in the U.S. At the same town hall conference at Hopkins, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy fiercely tried to explain the plight of the stigmatized and institutionalized addicts, thrown into a “revolving door” of antiquated rehabs and relapse, and urged attendees to heed a call by the FDA to treat addiction as a chronic disease much like type II diabetes, not an acute flare-up condition to be addressed in a 30-day rehab.

The Hopkins town hall made me realize that I had come full circle. I left the pharmaceutical rep business to search for meaningful ways to ameliorate the nation’s health. I now understand that science can change cultural perceptions of illness in line with some of the 20th century French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s writings on the phenomenology of perception. That is, pharmaceutical innovation, medical breakthroughs and publicity change our perception of stigmatized patients: Highly active antiretroviral therapy changed the life span and view of HIV patients in the 1990s (as did celebrity infection admissions - think Magic Johnson and, more recently Charlie Sheen), Prozac changed the perennial stigma of depressed and anxious patients with new hope in the 1980s, and even Viagra somewhat removed a stigma of growing older in society with diminishing sexual desires.

Many if not most of us know someone close to us struggling from addiction, wrapped up in the criminal justice system, kicked out of school and stigmatized from our communities - from Donald Trump’s older brother, to the homeless veterans who struggle with substance abuse in our city streets, to the Lumbee Native American tribe of North Carolina, to the lower-income African-Americans who relapse back and forth in between prisons and unemployment, and finally to the “vanishing population” of the white male middle-class.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. The time has come for a new approach, a new modality and a new cultural acceptance so that addicts can reintegrate into our society as one of us, not one of “them.”

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics to take over sales of rapid HIV test,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. announced plans Tuesday to take over U.S. sales of one of its rapid tests for HIV from another company on June 1.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV, syphilis, malaria and other diseases said distribution of its Sure Check HIV 1/2 Assay would no longer be done by Alere Inc. in the United States, effective May 31.

Chembio sales staff will market the test in the future to clinics and other health care facilities.

Chief executive John J. Sperzel III has built a sales force since joining the company in March 2014 and has signaled his plan to change how the test is sold domestically. Chembio already oversees sales in foreign countries.

Tuesday’s announcement “affirms our intent to gain full global rights related to the Sure Check HIV 1/2 Assay, including sales, marketing, distribution and trademark rights,” Sperzel said.

Waltham, Massachusetts-based Alere has been selling the Chembio blood test under the name Clearview Complete since 2006. The test produces a result in 15 minutes. It has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration and European regulators.

Sperzel said beginning June 1 Chembio would sell the test under the Sure Check name. He also said he couldn’t disclose the U.S. price until then.

NewsDay,"Nurses fail to follow steps to stop infection, research shows","Fewer than one-fifth of nurses who work in medical practices affiliated with the largest health care system in the region say they follow all nine steps that are highly recommended to prevent infection with the hepatitis C virus.

The steps are formally known as standard precautions for infection prevention, measures that are widely accepted throughout health care. But a team of doctoral-level nurses at Northwell Health, assisted by experts at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, found that some nurses skip steps, leaving themselves and patients vulnerable.

The team examined infection control methods in ambulatory care — at medical practices large and small — associated with the local health care giant.

Public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that the majority of people in the United States treated for medical conditions seek care in the ambulatory setting, accounting for 1.2 billion visits annually to physicians’ practices, outpatient centers and emergency rooms in hospitals.

But the new local research reveals that most nurses follow some infection-control steps; few adhere to all nine. Worse, some have poor knowledge about hepatitis C, an infectious agent that is on the rise.

“We questioned nurses in Suffolk, Nassau and Queens,” said Donna Armellino, vice president for infection prevention at Northwell’s division in Lake Success and a researcher on the study.

Armellino worked closely with her Northwell colleague Donna Powers, who began the research as a doctoral thesis, which morphed into an exposé of problems afoot in medical practices. The analysis is published in the current issue of the American Journal of Infection Control.

Powers and Armellino gave the nurses paper questionnaires and required that they be filled out in ink. They said sending the questions via email ran the risk of nurses deleting the questionnaires.

Nurses surveyed in the study were assessed based on precautionary measures known through evidence-based medicine to prevent infections in health care settings. While the precautions are strongly recommended by the CDC, they are not enforced by law.

All nine measures can help prevent transmission of hepatitis C — the focus of the analysis — as well as other serious viral infections, such as hepatitis B, HIV and deadly drug-resistant bacteria.

This is what Powers and Armellino asked nurses:

I provide nursing care considering all patients as potentially contagious

I wash my hands after the removal of gloves

I avoid placing foreign objects on my hands

I wear gloves when exposure of my hands to body fluids is anticipated

I avoid needle recapping

I avoid the disassembling of a used needle from a syringe

I use a face mask when exposure to air-transmitted pathogens is anticipated

I wash my hands after the provision of care

I discard used sharp materials into sharps containers

The team found that the highest rate of compliance involved gloving because 92 percent of nurses reported wearing them. Face mask usage was second at 70 percent. But compliance fell off in one of the most critical areas of health care — only 63 percent of participants reported washing their hands after glove removal.

In addition to the lapses in hygienic practices, the team also found that nurses lacked knowledge about hepatitis C, a virus that attacks the liver and can remain undetected for decades.

An estimated 26 percent of the nurses erroneously thought the pathogen is most commonly spread through sexual contact. Sexual transmission is low compared with needle sharing among drug users, or body piercing and tattooing in unhygienic settings.

Armellino said the analysis is important because it uncloaks problems about infection control and lapses in knowledge about a serious pathogen.

“There is a lot of research that focuses on hospitals,” with respect to infection control, Armellino said. “We wanted to add to the knowledge in the literature about the ambulatory setting.”",20/01/2016
NewsDay,"‘DC’s Legends of Tomorrow’ review: Supersized, overboiled on The CW","WHEN | WHERE Premieres Thursday at 8 p.m. on CW/11 GRADE C+

WHAT IT’S ABOUT Time traveler Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) has assembled a team of “legends” from the past to stop Vandal Savage (Casper Crump) from destroying humanity in the future. They are: Prof. Stein, aka Firestorm (Victor Garber); The Atom (Brandon Routh); White Canary (Caity Lotz); Heat Wave (Dominic Purcell); Captain Cold (Wentworth Miller); Kendra Saunders, aka Hawkgirl (Ciara Renée); Carter Hall, aka Hawkman (Falk Hentschel); and Jax Jackson/Firestorm (Franz Drameh). This “Arrow/“The Flash” spinoff is also produced by Greg Berlanti (and longtime “Chuck” co-executive producer Phil Klemmer).

MY SAY “Legends” might sound like a legend too far, or a legend too many. Or to quote one, who concisely sums up the time-travel spaghetti plate you’re also about to be handed: “Our son! Our son from our previous life?! It’s all too confusing.” Now we’ve got to worry about the son, too? Yeah, all too confusing. Add to this rapidly growing population our legend’s past selves, plus a new Mr. Bad (also his past self) and “Legends’ ” own Doctor Who. That spaghetti plate gets bigger and bigger . . . heavier and heavier . . .

Berlanti and his production team have already anticipated the potential mess. These legends are well-known commodities, especially to fans of “Arrow” and “The Flash.” The story is simple enough: Stop Vandal Savage in the past before he destroys humanity in the future.

So far so good. Then that story begins and so do the problems. For example, “Legends” obviously wants to lay out each character’s back story while keeping a close eye on the main one in the foreground. But depending on which of these you find most compelling — or which “legend” you do — is obviously going to affect how closely you’ll engage with the show. Me? Kendra and Carter’s complicated reincarnation tale is key here, but also pulls both Thursday’s pilot and next week’s second part to a dead stop whenever another piece arrives.

But “Legends” fans are information junkies, and they’ll be pleased to know that the two-parter hints at the much deeper DC universe that lies beyond -- the League of Assassins, specifically, while Neal McDonough's Damien Darhk, formerly of the League, now with H.I.V.E., makes an appearance next week too.

So let’s say TMI isn’t an issue for them (or you). But tone and writing possibly will be: “Legends” simply feels too loose, too campy. The perils here don’t seem as perilous as much as comical — unintentionally so.

NewsDay,"Charlie Sheen briefly quits HIV medication, manager says","Actor Charlie Sheen, who revealed in November that he is HIV-positive, says he stopped taking his medications and began undergoing unspecified treatment in Mexico — though his manager later clarified it was only a temporary suspension.

“I’ve been off my meds for about a week now,” “Anger Management” star Sheen, 50, said on the syndicated “The Dr. Oz Show” Tuesday, according to a People magazine transcript. “Am I risking my life? Sure. So what? I was born dead. That part of it doesn’t faze me at all.”

Dr. Mehmet Oz, 55, played audio from a telephone conversation with Sheen’s Mexican physician Dr. Sam Chachoua, who claimed to be so confident of treatment he was giving Sheen that “I drew some blood from him and I injected myself with it and I said, ‘Charlie, if I don’t know what I’m doing, then we’re both in trouble now aren’t we?’ ” Chachoua additionally claimed Sheen was “the first person in history without antiviral therapy” to be cured of HIV.

“I didn’t see it as Russian roulette,” Sheen told Oz. “I didn’t see it as a complete dismissal of the conventional course we’ve been on. I’m not recommending that anyone [do likewise]. I’m presenting myself as a type of guinea pig.”

He also revealed on the show that the previously undetectable amount of HIV in his blood has increased since November. “I’m a little off my game because right before I walked out here, I got some results I was disappointed about,” he told Oz. “I had been nondetectable . . . and checking the blood every week and then found out the numbers are back up.”

Sheen’s manager Mark Burg, however, told People later Tuesday that Sheen did resume taking his medications on Dec. 8, after the episode was shot. “Charlie is back on his meds. He tried a cure from a doctor in Mexico but the minute the numbers went up, he started taking his medicine,” Burg said. “He said he would start on the plane on the way home and that is exactly what he did.”

In the audience for the episode was Sheen’s U.S. physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga, who told the actor, “It would just break my heart if you did anything where you threw that opportunity . . . away and went back to where we were several decades ago,” adding, “It would just break my heart if we were to risk returning to that horrible part of our history.”",12/01/2016
NewsDay,"New pediatric guidelines include screening for HIV, depression, cholesterol","The American Academy of Pediatrics recently released its updated list of recommended health care screenings for children, which includes checking for depression, high cholesterol and HIV. Mayo Clinic Children’s Center pediatrician Dr. Angela Mattke says the revised recommendations are a “firm affirmative to pediatricians that doing these screenings or testing will be beneficial to the child’s health.”

What are well-child visits?

Well-child visits are another name for routine checkups or physicals. “Much of the AAP Preventive Health Care Screening and Assessment Schedule for Children’s Checkups includes screening as opposed to skipping straight to testing,” Mattke says. “Screening usually involves asking questions pertaining to the subject or using a validated screening tool . . . to make sure questions are asked in such a way that have been shown to pick up children and teens at risk for whatever they are screening for.”

She stresses that screening children is necessary because some children are at risk for these health conditions, the rate of the conditions is increasing in younger age groups and, without screening, they may go undiagnosed and suffer serious health consequences.

Depression screening every year from ages 11 through 21

“Depression screening is so important. Mood disorders and suicide rates increased over the last couple of decades,” Mattke says. “At least 10 percent of my practice is treating children with depression and anxiety. If we don’t ask them about it in a safe manner, they may not disclose.”

High cholesterol screening for children between 9 and 11 years

Testing or screening children beginning at age 9 for high blood cholesterol levels may help reduce the national trend of increased childhood obesity. Mattke says by addressing high cholesterol in childhood, we can reduce their adult risk factors for early coronary artery disease. She adds that teaching children and families about healthy diets and the importance of physical activity is a start.

HIV screening for adolescents between 16 and 18 years

“HIV rates are still increasing in this age group. Catching it early can mean a large difference in their overall health and ability to give it to other people through unprotected sex,” Mattke says.

For parents and caregivers

The new recommendations, says Mattke, should “give confidence to parents and guardians that their pediatricians are trying to give their children the best, evidence-based care. We do these screenings because they can impact the health and well-being of their child in a positive way.”

NewsDay,Woman struggles with pushy mother-in-law-to-be,"DEAR AMY: I have a controlling, manipulative guilt-tripping mother-in-law-to-be! I know that each time I hear from her she is just trying to trap me into saying yes to something. These traps include trying to get me to change our wedding plans, and roping me into a jewelry party hosted by her friend (repeatedly pushing on that). She just can’t understand the word “no.” When I did say no she whined to my fiance, saying it felt like a slap in the face (can you say “manipulation?”). This has to stop. My fiance tried dealing with it by telling his mom that I will say no to some things, but I felt this was really his way of calling me “pushy.” My fiance tried the kid gloves approach and it didn’t work. I decided to take matters into my own hands and texted her three examples of her overstepping her boundaries and letting her know it would no longer be tolerated. She had the nerve to say it made her “sad.” Now he is having a hard time because his mom is upset. He doesn’t understand that we have to back each other up, especially in situations like this. His mom is so bad that she needs a copy of his shift schedule at work because she wants to keep track of him. Maybe my approach is too direct, but so what? We are in our 40s and don’t need to be under her thumb. I don’t let my mom get away with this kind of behavior and I’m certainly not letting a MIL do this. What is your opinion, Amy? — Upset

DEAR UPSET: Reading your letter gives me a case of anxiety hives, as I look into the future and see no way out for your poor guy. In terms of who gets to control him, he seems to have met his mother’s match.

Your fiance has been giving in to his mother for a lifetime. Do not insist that he fight her using your aggressive techniques. You are taking the coward’s way out by texting offensive lists of her transgressions and then hiding behind your fiance when she reacts. Of course this makes her sad, and you can affirm this without going on her guilt trip.

You two should sit down with her and as kindly and calmly as possible let her know that when you say “no” to something the first time, that is also a final answer. Expect her to react in the way that has worked for her in the past — to be emotional and try to manipulate both of you. You can respectfully say, “I can tell this is hard for you, but if we give it time, I know we can all adjust.” Be friendly, respectful, firm and consistent.

DEAR AMY: After my 40-year marriage ended earlier this year, I have begun to date. I’m only spending time with women near my own age (68). I feel as if I’m being held responsible for a lot of perceived mistreatment by past partners of the people I date. I’ve sensed control issues and even anger when I propose a date or time or specific activity. I don’t think I’m being overly aggressive or suggesting anything that isn’t appropriate in a get-acquainted phase of a relationship. What gives? — Wondering Gentleman

DEAR WONDERING: One hazard of dating after divorce is bringing along the ghosts of other partners when you’re trying to date again. The women you are with might be hyper-sensitive to any possibility that you could be trying to control them because of something a previous partner did (this is not fair to you). But one other thing to consider is the possibility that you, too, are responding to these women through a lens that is colored by the dynamic of your very long marriage.

You could respond to this in a way that disarms your dates and also opens a window into this dynamic. You say, “I sense some tension here. Can you tell me what you are reacting to? I’m still new at this dating thing and I’d like to hear what you’re thinking.”

NewsDay,Letter: Planned Parenthood stopping HIV/AIDS,"We have come a long way in the fight against HIV/AIDS [“Bill de Blasio, Andrew Cuomo pitch efforts to fight AIDS,” News, Dec. 2]. After the United Nations adopted Millennium Development Goals in 2000, new HIV infections fell by roughly 40 percent through 2013. But the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to affect millions of people, with marginalized communities disproportionately harmed.

Many don’t realize that Planned Parenthood is a leading educator and provider of HIV testing. In 2013, the last year for which data are available, Planned Parenthood health centers provided 704,000 HIV tests nationwide. In 2014, Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic health centers and SmartWheels mobile education and testing vans provided 13,100 rapid HIV tests in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Suffolk counties.

Yet rather than support such needed efforts, members of Congress who oppose women’s health will likely continue to push for a policy rider that defunds Planned Parenthood in the next round of budget negotiations.

Defunding Planned Parenthood really means taking health care — including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections like HIV — away from the 2.7 million women, men and young people Planned Parenthood serves each year.

Let’s protect our progress and double down on our efforts to end this epidemic.

NewsDay,State of the fight against AIDS,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic on Long Island remains one of the largest in the United States and in New York. In fact, although we hear very little about it, more than 6,200 people are infected on Long Island, second only to New York City in the state.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has unveiled a plan to end the AIDS epidemic in New York, and this week he announced he was adding $200 million in resources to the cause. The goal is to reduce the number of new HIV infections to just 750 by 2020 and achieve the first-ever decrease in HIV prevalence in the state. This includes identifying people with HIV and linking them to care and treatment, maintaining regular contact with health providers to achieve viral suppression, and making access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (better known as PrEP, an

FDA-approved medication to prevention transmission of HIV) easy and affordable.

On Friday, as part of this effort, Hofstra University and Pride for Youth, a program of the Long Island Crisis Center, will present the results of a sexual health prevention and behavior survey of 215 young gay and bisexual men from Nassau County. Nationwide, young gay and bisexual men account for 72 percent of new HIV infections among 13- to 24-year-olds, and 30 percent of new infections among gay and bisexual men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Some interesting findings from our survey include:

36 percent did not tell their health provider about their sexual orientation.

33 percent did not ask the HIV status of the last person with whom they had sex.

Most men reported having sex up with up to three partners in the last year.

29 percent hadn’t been tested or were tested once for HIV in the last two years (CDC guidelines recommend sexually active gay men be tested every three to six months).

Those of us who work in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment hope to use the survey results to develop better strategies to help all those at risk of infection protect themselves.

Getting tested, using male and female condoms correctly (the most effective protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases), and considering biomedical interventions such as PrEP (which is designed primarily for people at very high risk of sexual exposure to HIV) remain the most effective methods to reducing the rates of this disease nationwide. The education may need to start in the doctor’s office: The CDC recently reported that a third of primary care providers had never even heard of PrEP.

The survey’s data are important to medical and social service providers on Long Island who serve young adult populations as well as members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) community. Establishing local best practices for HIV prevention, especially for the LGBTQ community, will equip county and other local providers with the data they need to better design programs.

More than three decades after the first cases of AIDS were reported in the United States, the fundamental message remains the same, as does the challenge to communicate it clearly.

NewsDay,State of the fight against AIDS,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic on Long Island remains one of the largest in the United States and in New York. In fact, although we hear very little about it, more than 6,200 people are infected on Long Island, second only to New York City in the state.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has unveiled a plan to end the AIDS epidemic in New York, and this week he announced he was adding $200 million in resources to the cause. The goal is to reduce the number of new HIV infections to just 750 by 2020 and achieve the first-ever decrease in HIV prevalence in the state. This includes identifying people with HIV and linking them to care and treatment, maintaining regular contact with health providers to achieve viral suppression, and making access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (better known as PrEP, an FDA-approved medication to prevention transmission of HIV) easy and affordable.

On Friday, as part of this effort, Hofstra University and Pride for Youth, a program of the Long Island Crisis Center, will present the results of a sexual health prevention and behavior survey of 215 young gay and bisexual men from Nassau County. Nationwide, young gay and bisexual men account for 72 percent of new HIV infections among 13- to 24-year-olds, and 30 percent of new infections among gay and bisexual men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Some interesting findings from our survey include:

36 percent did not tell their health provider about their sexual orientation.

33 percent did not ask the HIV status of the last person with whom they had sex.

Most men reported having sex up with up to three partners in the last year.

29 percent hadn't been tested or were tested once for HIV in the last two years (CDC guidelines recommend sexually active gay men be tested every three to six months).

Those of us who work in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment hope to use the survey results to develop better strategies to help all those at risk of infection protect themselves. Getting tested, using male and female condoms correctly (the most effective protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases), and considering biomedical interventions such as PrEP (which is designed primarily for people at very high risk of sexual exposure to HIV) remain the most effective methods to reducing the rates of this disease nationwide. The education may need to start in the doctor's office: The CDC recently reported that a third of primary care providers had never even heard of PrEP.

The survey's data are important to medical and social service providers on Long Island who serve young adult populations as well as members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) community. Establishing local best practices for HIV prevention, especially for the LGBTQ community, will equip county and other local providers with the data they need to better design programs.

More than three decades after the first cases of AIDS were reported in the United States, the fundamental message remains the same, as does the challenge to communicate it clearly.

Get tested regularly. Know your status. Correctly and consistently use condoms and other forms of prevention. These are things, as our survey results show, we still don't do well enough. If we did, we would not have an HIV/AIDS epidemic today.

NewsDay,"Bill De Blasio, Andrew Cuomo pitch efforts to fight AIDS","New York City officials announced Tuesday — on World AIDS Day — that they will put $23 million in new annual funding toward prevention and treatment to stop the disease.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, speaking separately at the same event at Harlem’s Apollo Theater, said his administration will seek financial and programmatic commitments of $200 million toward housing, life insurance and other programs. The funds would come on top of $2.5 billion that the state currently spends combatting HIV/AIDS.

In the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration will — among other efforts — expand the HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA) housing, nutrition and transportation assistance to all New Yorkers with HIV or AIDS, regardless of whether they show symptoms. The HASA program is currently limited to those who have AIDS or symptomatic HIV.

The city has 120,000 New Yorkers living with HIV and AIDS, 80 percent of the state’s cases, de Blasio said. The city seeks to steadily lower its number of cases in line with the statewide goal of no more than 750 new infections annually by 2020.

City Council member Corey Johnson (D-Manhattan), who is HIV positive, at the event said the city’s new funding aligns with Cuomo’s blueprint to fight the virus.

City health officials said the city last year had a historic-low 2,718 residents who were newly diagnosed compared with 4,397 new cases in 2004.

“We can beat this epidemic with our existing tools,” City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett told reporters. Resources include the distribution of free condoms, the #PlaySure media campaign to encourage safe sex practices and access to treatments such as the pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis medications known as PrEP and PEP.",01/12/2015
NewsDay,HIV-positive doctor says his dog saved his life,"Rob Garofalo was devastated. He’d built his medical and research career on helping young AIDS patients. Then he learned that he, too, was HIV-positive. The news came after he’d already survived kidney cancer and a breakup with his longtime partner.

Try as he might, the doctor could not heal himself, at least not emotionally.

“I couldn’t afford myself the same compassion that I’d spent a career teaching other people to have,” says Garofalo, who heads the adolescent medicine division at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. At first, he told almost no one about his HIV status — not even his own elderly mother, who sensed that her son was struggling mightily during a Christmas visit in 2010.

“You can tell me that everything is OK, but it’s not,” she said, cupping her hands around her son’s face at the end of his trip to his native New Jersey.

Garofalo recalls crying on much of the flight home to Chicago in a catharsis that led him to an unexpected decision, one that helped him in ways no human could and ultimately led him to a new role in the HIV community.

He got a dog.

It was a little Yorkshire terrier he named Fred. And everything changed.

“I had this little bundle of, like, pure joy,” Garofalo says. “He made me re-engage with the world.”

The doctor, who’s helped save many an AIDS patient, knows it sounds a little crazy that the companionship and simple needs of a pet could help him cope with his disease and pull him out of depression.

“But I’m not exaggerating when I say that he saved my life,” says Garofalo, who’d considered suicide after his HIV diagnosis.

His journey back to life started with simple things. He had to leave the apartment where he’d isolated himself to buy food for Fred. He had to talk to the many people who wanted to stop and pet the little dog. Garofalo also found comfort when he’d awaken with one of his frequent night terrors and have Fred to snuggle.

Eventually, Garofalo sought counseling and told his mother and friends about his HIV status. As his energy level grew, he also started a charity using Fred’s image to raise money for programs that help HIV-positive teens.

He continued to share his story, even with strangers on Fred’s charity website. And Garofalo began to realize that he was far from the only person with HIV — or any number of other diseases — who’d been helped by a dog. And in that human-canine bond, he saw new purpose and an opportunity to grow his charity’s reach.

He began a project called “When Dogs Heal,” with the help of a dog photographer named Jesse Freidin and a Chicago-based writer named Zach Stafford. It tells the stories of HIV-positive people and their dogs in an exhibit launching in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 1, which is World AIDS Day, and also in New York City two days later.

Participants whose images are in the show include a young mother from Los Angeles who was born with HIV, a Chicago man who tested positive after he was gang raped, and an HIV-positive man in San Francisco who quit dealing drugs so he could provide a more stable life for himself and his newly adopted dog.

“I would be in bed and not want to get up, but . this little doggy was whining, licking my neck and needed to get outside. I had to get up,” says Lynnea Garbutt, the young mom. She says her wirehaired fox terrier, Coconut, eventually helped her muster the courage to leave an abusive relationship and also prepared her to care for her daughter, who recently turned 1. The child is not HIV-positive thanks to medical interventions that can now prevent the spread of the virus from mother to infant.

Though many participants’ stories have difficult elements, Freidin, the photographer, said the exhibit also shows “something joyful.”

Daniel Cardenas, an HIV-positive Chicagoan who’ll appear in the upcoming exhibit with his dog, Loki, certainly sees that in his dog.

“He’s really a symbol for me,” Cardenas says, “a symbol of hope, of promise, of a future.”

Hope is a relatively new chapter in the AIDS fight. In decades past, doctors, including Garofalo, were desperate to save people with HIV. Now, with new, less complicated treatments, many people are living healthy, productive lives with the AIDS virus.

Stigma is still an issue, however.

Even a matter of months ago, and although he’d gone public with his HIV status, Garofalo did not want to talk about how he suspects he contracted the virus because he doesn’t want to inadvertently imply that people who’ve gotten the virus through drug use or consensual sex deserve to be shamed.

He was sexually assaulted in November 2009 during a trip to Washington, D.C., and although he’s not entirely sure he got the virus then, it fits with the timing of his diagnosis.

“I wasn’t perfect. I could’ve gotten it another way,” says Garofalo, who concedes that his sometimes self-destructive downward spiral had begun much earlier, when he was diagnosed with renal cell cancer a decade ago, just after he’d turned 40. “The truth is, I was a mess even back then,” he says.

Having recently turned 50, and with all he’s been through, he says he’s grown a lot — and now sees his HIV patients in a much less academic manner.

“Now I approach it in a very different way because it comes from my soul,” he says.

Even amid his personal distress, he says he somehow managed to keep his career on track. He now heads the Center for Gender, Sexuality and HIV Prevention at Lurie Children’s Hospital.

“Rob is a hero,” says the Rev. Stan Sloan, CEO of Chicago House, an organization that provides homeless services to HIV-positive people and others. “And Fred has been a critical part of that.”

An HIV-positive teen in Los Angeles recently wrote Garofalo a letter to thank him and his Fred-inspired charity for providing money so he could buy a much-needed pair of shoes.

“The initiative you started because of a dream, a prayer and a dog has blessed me,” the teen wrote.

Garofalo says he owes it all to Fred, whose portrait with his owner will appear in the exhibit. It is an impact his mom saw take hold almost immediately when her son visited with Fred in the spring of 2010, after that Christmas visit.

Even now, Garofalo gets emotional when he tells the story of coming downstairs to find his mother cradling the dog.

“My mom was . telling him that he was a miracle,” Garofalo says, his eyes reddening, “because he had brought her son back.”",29/11/2015
NewsDay,Shinnecocks explore starting medical marijuana program,"The Shinnecock Indian Nation is exploring the prospect of a medical marijuana cultivation and dispensary program, citing federal rules that allow sovereign tribes to offer such facilities if they are compliant with state and federal laws.

The Southampton tribe, which won federal recognition in 2010, is consulting with state and federal health and law enforcement authorities, and an outside financial partner, to determine whether to move ahead with such a facility. Currently, only one such dispensary is planned for Suffolk County, in Riverhead. Another is planned for Nassau.

Consideration of a Shinnecock program follows a U.S. Department of Justice memo in December that eased conditions under which it would enforce marijuana laws on tribal lands. The so-called Cole Memo was interpreted as saying tribes in states that have approved medical marijuana would be free to pursue such programs if they complied with a list of eight enforcement ""priorities,"" including preventing distribution to minors.

Any Shinnecock program also would have to comply with New York's Compassionate Care Act, passed by the State Legislature in June 2014. It legalized use of nonsmokable forms of the drug, including pills, vapors, tinctures and oils for those with specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, epilepsy HIV/AIDS and Lou Gehrig's disease.

""Since the Compassionate Care Act became law last year, our tribal leaders -- like many others -- have sought counsel from the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of New York on what this means for a sovereign nation like ours,"" Bryan Polite, chairman of the Shinnecock tribal trustees, said in a statement to Newsday. ""We are continuing to gather information as part of that exploratory process.""

He stressed, ""No decisions have been made, nor will they be, without the input and approval of the Shinnecock Indian Nation membership.""

Tribal programs, including one being considered by the Seneca Nation upstate, would operate in addition to the five registered companies authorized in the state, for which some 20 dispensaries have been approved. Earlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed an ""emergency access law"" ordering the state Health Department to register more groups to produce medical marijuana ""as soon as practicable.""

Experts have advised the tribe that a medical marijuana program could employ up to 50 people directly -- with secondary jobs pushing that number to 80 to 100 members -- and provide needed revenue for tribal government, health care, education and other services.

Because the Shinnecocks are considering cultivating medical marijuana as well as dispensing it, the tribe is exploring the need for a highly secure facility on the 800-acre Southampton reservation, including a beefed up security force, eight-foot fencing around a secure indoor growing facility, and employee background checks.

If all goes as planned and tribal members approve, the Shinnecock Nation could open such a facility in about eight months. Revenue from the program could be substantial for approved entities. Around 125,000 people could qualify for medicinal marijuana statewide, with each patient spending around $400 a month, according to estimates provided to the tribe. For the Shinnecock Nation, the need for increased revenue has become increasingly acute since a series of roadblocks stalled its plans for one or more gambling casinos two years ago.",23/11/2015
NewsDay,Charlie Sheen's manager responds to Jenny McCarthy's complaint about not disclosing HIV status,"Charlie Sheen's manager has responded to actress Jenny McCarthy's complaint about Sheen not disclosing his HIV status when she guest-starred on his show ""Two and a Half Men,"" by saying there was nothing to disclose.

Mark Burg told People magazine, ""Charlie was infected long after he left 'Two and a Half Men' and long after he worked with Jenny,"" who played love-interest Courtney on eight episodes that aired from November 2007 to October 2011. In an open letter that Sheen, 50, released following his announcement on the ""Today"" show Tuesday that he is HIV positive, the actor said he was diagnosed with the virus ""roughly four years ago.""

On her SiriusXM radio show ""Dirty, Sexy, Funny"" on Wednesday, McCarthy, 43, married just over a year to singer-actor Donnie Wahlberg, said: ""In the acting world . . . before we do a job, we have to sign a piece of paper that asks, 'Do you have cold sores?' "" and that if one answers affirmatively ""you have to show the medication. . . . Now, being on 'Two and a Half Men' . . . and playing a love interest, you would think that there would be some type of, I don't want to say, not criminal issue, but, what -- I don't even know how to feel about that.""

""I'm like, wait a second, if I have to be up front about a herpe[s infection], how could you not be up front about HIV? . . . I look back and I'm like, OK, that would have been some valuable information. Look how many people have played his love interest on the show. Not that you can, obviously, get [HIV] through kissing, but still, that's a big deal.""

The actress felt the need to clarify herself on Twitter Thursday.

""The point I raised about Charlie Sheen on my Sirius radio show,"" she tweeted, ""had nothing to do with whether or not I think he put me at risk.""

McCarthy continued, ""Yet an actor who interacts physically with dozens of actresses in intimate scenes, is not required to disclose that he has HIV? I am very aware that HIV is not spread through kissing, but I also believe that if an actress has to disclose all of her business before kissing a male costar, that actor should be required to disclose something [as] major as an HIV infection too.""

NewsDay,Boys and shaving: What age is appropriate,"Q. Is 11 years old too young for a boy to start shaving?

A. “It’s really a personal choice,” says Dr. Pamela Basuk, secretary of the Long Island Dermatological Society and a dermatologist in private practice in Bay Shore. Puberty is starting earlier for both boys and girls, which means facial and body hair growth may begin earlier and so may the desire to shave, she says.

“If he has enough hair to shave and a parent feels comfortable having him handle a razor, then shaving is appropriate at that age,” Basuk says. As long as the shaving isn’t causing a rash, it shouldn’t be a problem, she says.

A role model should teach him the right way to shave safely so that he doesn’t cut himself, Basuk says.

She recommends starting him with a fragrance-free shaving cream, as he’s putting a new substance on his skin and it’s best to make sure he doesn’t have an allergic reaction. She suggests testing whether he prefers an electric razor or a single or double-edge razor; electric razors tend to be less irritating to the skin and can be easier to use, Basuk says. He may want to apply a moisturizer after shaving, as shaving can be abrasive to the skin, especially when someone first starts to shave, she says. Other tips: Shave after showering, when hairs are softer, and shave in the direction of the hair to minimize irritation, Basuk says.

Teach him never to share razors with others. A razor can transmit viruses such as herpes, warts, HIV or any blood-borne disease or infection, Basuk says.

If he does happen to develop a persistent rash from shaving, you may want to take him to a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment, she says.

The same age-related advice goes for girls who want to shave their legs or underarms — it’s personal choice, Basuk says.",18/11/2015
NewsDay,Charlie Sheen: 'My partying days are behind me',"Actor Charlie Sheen, who revealed on NBC's ""Today"" show Tuesday that he is HIV positive, subsequently issued a long open letter detailing his condition.

""Roughly four years ago, I suddenly found myself in the throws [sic] of a seismic and debilitating three-day cluster-migraine-like headache,"" Sheen, 50, wrote. ""I was emergently hospitalized with what I believed to be a brain tumor or perhaps some unknown pathology. I was partially correct. Following a battery of endless tests, that included a hideous spinal tap, it was sadly and shockingly revealed to me that I was, in fact, positive for HIV.""

In an attached statement, his physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga, wrote that Sheen had come to see him ""with an upper viral infection followed by joint aches, swallowing complaints and then progressive severe headaches."" When tests uncovered the human immunodeficiency virus, Sheen ""was immediately placed on four antiretroviral drugs and his HIV viral blood levels thankfully dropped to undetectable. He has tolerated his antiretroviral cocktail and by faithfully complying with the daily pills, his viral HIV load has remained consistently undetectable.""

Initially, however, ""The news was a 'mule kick' to my soul,"" Sheen wrote. ""Those impossible words I absorbed and then tried to convince myself, that I was stuck, suspended, or even stranded inside some kind of alternate reality or nightmare, were to the absolute contrary.""

He conceded that during his partying years he ""dazedly chose (or hired) the companionship of unsavory and insipid types,"" but insisted he used protection and was honest about his condition. ""Sadly,"" he wrote, ""my truth soon became their treason, as a deluge of blackmail and extortion took center stage in this circus of deceit. To date, I have paid out countless millions to these desperate charlatans.""

Now, he says: ""My partying days are behind me. My philanthropic days are ahead of me.""

In his interview, Sheen told Matt Lauer that he would no longer pay blackmail money, adding that ""I release myself from this prison today.""

""What people forget is that's money they're taking from my children. They think it's just me, but I've got five kids and a granddaughter,"" he said.",17/11/2015
NewsDay,Charlie Sheen confirms HIV positive status in 'Today' interview,"In the heavily promoted Charlie Sheen interview with host Matt Lauer that ""Today"" promised would be ""highly revealing,"" the former star of ""Two and a Half Men"" Tuesday morning officially confirmed what various websites have already reported -- that he is HIV positive.

He also said in the interview, conducted live just before 8 a.m., that he has been the victim of blackmail -- or shakedowns, to use Lauer's term -- by several people who knew of his condition, and that he had paid out ""millions"" to silence them, later confirming to Lauer that he had paid out $10 million. By admitting in such a public forum to his condition -- Tuesday's ""Today"" interview -- he said his ""goal"" was to escape further payouts. ""I think I release myself from this prison today,"" he said.

After telling Lauer that he'd had unprotected sex since learning of his condition, Sheen, 50, was asked whether he expected to face lawsuits. He replied: ""I would be predicting the future and assuming the worst. I can only imagine, based on what I've experienced, I'm sure that's what's next.""

Lauer further noted that Sheen, by not revealing his illness to partners, could be criminally liable in dozens of states. ""Having divulged it is the reason I'm in the mess I am with all the shakedowns. Again, I can't sit here and protect against all of that, and [can] only sit here and tell my truth.""

At the outset of the interview, Sheen said, ""I am in fact HIV positive. I have to put an end to this barrage of attacks, of subtruths, and very harmful and mercurial stories that are threatening the health of so many others, of [stories] that couldn't be further from the truth.""

He said he first learned of his condition four years ago, after suffering headaches and night sweats. Tests later confirmed that he was HIV positive. Sheen added that it was ""impossible"" that others with whom he had sexual relations had also been infected.

Sheen was fired off ""Men"" four years ago in the middle of a public breakdown -- fueled, he said at the time, by drugs and alcohol. It's unclear from the interview whether Sheen knew of his illness at the time of his firing. Sheen said that "" 'roid rage"" was the cause of his behavior.

Sheen said in the interview that up until now, he had told only a few people of his illness, telling Lauer that those included former wives, Brooke Mueller and Denise Richards. Sheen and adult film star Brett Rossi recently broke off their engagement, and various websites -- notably the National Enquirer -- said that she had learned of his illness after they had become engaged. Sheen said of the people he had told, ""for some reason I trusted them. They were deep in my inner circle, and I thought they could be helpful. Instead my trust turned to their treason.""

Also appearing with Sheen during the interview was his doctor -- Dr. Robert Huizuenga, well-known to viewers of ""The Biggest Loser"" as ""Dr. H,"" where he frequently appears -- who said the actor had responded well to his drug regimen and that there was no ""detectable"" virus in his blood.

The ""Today"" interview -- appearing in the middle of November sweeps, while ""Today"" is in a furious scramble with ""Good Morning America"" to regain its ratings leadership -- is of course just the latest twist in a long and often troubled career.

At the time Sheen was fired off ""Men,"" he was TV's highest paid actor, later launching ""My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option"" -- a bizarre, formless, onstage ramble about drugs, booze and those who he claimed had betrayed him. He later said the tour wasn't about revenge, but about money -- he earned a reported $7 million -- because he said he was ""broke"" after CBS fired him.

FX later signed him to a long-term contract to star in a sitcom, ""Anger Management."" It was canceled last year.",17/11/2015

NewsDay,Lessons from the activist front,"I am continually mystified at media images and sound bites focused on gun violence. On nearly any given day, you can turn on the TV and see coverage of a new mass shooting in America -- the latest in a never-ending string of incidents. Hours later, our nation's leaders are out at the microphones, expressing our collective sorrow. And then the ephemeral pictures and words fade away, just in time for the next commercial break.

""What is happening to us?"" begins the water-cooler conversation the next day. ""Americans have faced other human tragedies before and found a way to make an impact.""

Advocates working to prevent gun violence should consider taking a page from the playbook of the HIV/AIDS awareness movement. That activism was born of the AIDS Memorial Quilt (The NAMES Project Foundation) and the powerful group Act-Up in the 1980s. At a time when there was little, if any, government action to fight a disease ravaging the gay community, NAMES Project founder Cleve Jones decided that the best way to combat HIV/AIDS and raise awareness was to memorialize each person who had died.

In essence, by naming the dead, it took away the anonymity that fueled the lack of response. The people lost were no longer those ""queers"" from New York or San Francisco, but rather our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, uncles, cousins, friends, and neighbors. While HIV/AIDS has continued to take its toll 30 years into the epidemic, the AIDS Memorial Quilt sparked a movement that has led to making great headway in keeping the disease at bay and given rise to other organizations that research treatments, help the afflicted and ultimately look for a cure.

Act-Up, led by the force of Larry Kramer, demanded attention to the matter by drawing a line in the sand. Whether you were with them or against them, Kramer made it clear: No one was going anywhere without confronting the truth about how our country was neglecting the human tragedy surrounding us.

Taking it a step further, gun violence prevention activists should not only end the anonymity of gun violence victims and celebrate their lives, but they also can name and shame those who have created a climate that allows gun violence to flourish: NRA leaders, gun manufacturers that produce assault weapons, and lawmakers who have repeatedly failed to pass common sense gun measures. We must unmask the bullies and shout the names of those now shielded by anonymity.

When addressing the most recent mass shooting that occurred in Oregon, President Barack Obama, exasperated at yet another gun tragedy, said: ""My response here at this podium ends up being routine . . . We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.""

NewsDay,Cuomo fast-tracks medical marijuana distribution,"ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo Wednesday signed legislation to fast-track the distribution of medical marijuana to patients with serious illnesses through government-approved dispensaries, including one each in Nassau and Suffolk counties.

In the action, Cuomo reversed some safeguards required in the Compassionate Care Act, passed in June, that were meant to ensure the system doesn't contribute to illegal marijuana use.

The medical marijuana emergency access law directs the state Health Department to register additional organizations to produce medical marijuana ""as soon as practicable and issue new regulations that waive the tight controls that are the hallmark of the Compassionate Care Act.""

That includes registering companies already manufacturing and distributing medical marijuana in other states, he said.

In October, Riverhead Town officials agreed tentatively to allow a medical marijuana dispensary to open at an oncology office. The pharmacy-like facility will be operated by Columbia Care NY LLC at 1333 E. Main St.

The Nassau County dispensary run by Bloomfield Industries is planned for a professional building at 2001 Marcus Ave., Lake Success.

Cuomo also ordered the Health Department to determine whether the limited number of dispensaries approved in June -- 20 statewide -- are enough.

The analysis will show if ""additional manufacturers and dispensaries are necessary to improve access statewide,"" Cuomo said in a statement.

Statewide, five companies are approved to run dispensaries beginning Jan. 5. The emergency access law signed Wednesday allows for an earlier start if the system is certified by the state Health Department and State Police.

The Compassionate Care Act allows medical marijuana to be used to aid in the treatment of illnesses including cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Approved forms of medical marijuana include liquids and oil for vaporization or administration via inhaler as well as capsules that are taken orally, according to the state. Smoking is prohibited.

""This emergency access law is designed to get medicine to the neediest patients, including young children, as quickly as possible,"" said Assemb. Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan), a longtime sponsor of medical marijuana bills.'

""For the most seriously ill patients, even minor delays -- a day, a week, a month -- are life-changing,"" Gottfried said.

Speeding up medical marijuana

Key elements of the emergency medical marijuana access bill signed Wednesday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo:

A ""new and entirely separate"" emergency distribution program for patients with ""progressive and degenerative"" diseases covered by the Compassionate Care Act if delay would threaten the patients.

An order for the state Health Department to register more companies, including those already operating out of state, to produce medical marijuana for patients faster.

Waiving some tight controls in the Compassionate Care Act.

Comprehensive assessment to determine if more manufacturers and dispensaries are required to meet the needs of New Yorkers. Currently, the law allows five companies to operate 20 dispensaries statewide, including one each in Suffolk and Nassau counties.

The state's emergency program must conform with the federal regulations aimed at keeping the medication from being sold illegally.

The medical marijuana emergency access law directs the state Health Department to register additional organizations to produce medical marijuana ""as soon as practicable and issue new regulations that waive the tight controls that are the hallmark of the Compassionate Care Act.""

That includes registering companies already manufacturing and distributing medical marijuana in other states, he said.

In October, Riverhead Town officials agreed tentatively to allow a medical marijuana dispensary to open at an oncology office. The pharmacy-like facility will be operated by Columbia Care NY LLC at 1333 E. Main St.

The Nassau County dispensary run by Bloomfield Industries is planned for a professional building at 2001 Marcus Ave., Lake Success.

Cuomo also ordered the Health Department to determine whether the limited number of dispensaries approved in June -- 20 statewide -- are enough.

The analysis will show if ""additional manufacturers and dispensaries are necessary to improve access statewide,"" Cuomo said in a statement.

Statewide, five companies are approved to run dispensaries beginning Jan. 5. The emergency access law signed Wednesday allows for an earlier start if the system is certified by the state Health Department and State Police.

The Compassionate Care Act allows medical marijuana to be used to aid in the treatment of illnesses including cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Approved forms of medical marijuana include liquids and oil for vaporization or administration via inhaler as well as capsules that are taken orally, according to the state. Smoking is prohibited.

""This emergency access law is designed to get medicine to the neediest patients, including young children, as quickly as possible,"" said Assemb. Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan), a longtime sponsor of medical marijuana bills.'

""For the most seriously ill patients, even minor delays -- a day, a week, a month -- are life-changing,"" Gottfried said.

Speeding up medical marijuana

Key elements of the emergency medical marijuana access bill signed Wednesday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo:

A ""new and entirely separate"" emergency distribution program for patients with ""progressive and degenerative"" diseases covered by the Compassionate Care Act if delay would threaten the patients.

An order for the state Health Department to register more companies, including those already operating out of state, to produce medical marijuana for patients faster.

Waiving some tight controls in the Compassionate Care Act.

Comprehensive assessment to determine if more manufacturers and dispensaries are required to meet the needs of New Yorkers. Currently, the law allows five companies to operate 20 dispensaries statewide, including one each in Suffolk and Nassau counties.

The state's emergency program must conform with the federal regulations aimed at keeping the medication from being sold illegally.

NewsDay,"Nassau's and other county jails' inmate health care not routinely monitored or accredited, despite higher illness rates","No organization or government agency nationally or statewide routinely monitors or accredits all jails to ensure they are providing satisfactory health care to inmates, who are often sicker than the general population and unhappy with their medical care.

In New York, state oversight of medical care in jails -- unlike hospitals and nursing homes -- generally takes place after a death or complaint.

There's little incentive to change that to ensure that inmates get quality health care, largely because communities don't want to pay much for inmates, who aren't a sympathetic or powerful group, advocates and experts said.

""There's always an incentive not to provide care, to keep costs down,"" said Jack Beck, director of the Prison Visiting Project at the nonprofit advocacy group Correctional Association of New York.

Jails in New York, as in the rest of the country, are run by cities or counties, which also are responsible for the medical care.

In New York, the Commission of Correction is the state agency tasked with overseeing 54 state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision facilities, 14 New York City Department of Correction facilities and 63 county jails with about 77,500 inmates and prisoners. This includes 1,170 inmates in Nassau and 1,407 in Suffolk.

The commission, which has an annual budget of $2.9 million and a staff budgeted for 32 but down to 31, does annual inspections of the jails, but ""they don't frequently encompass medical care,"" said commission spokesman Justin Mason.

Instead, its five-person forensic medical unit investigates deaths and allegations of poor care or systemic problems.

How oversight works

Their findings are presented to the seven-person Medical Review Board, which meets four times a year and issues a report. If violations are found, the commission monitors the jail to see that it implements the required reforms.

The commission can be scathing in its findings. It recently declared the company that Nassau County hired in 2011 to provide medical care at its jail, Armor Correctional Health Services of Miami, ""incompetent"" in the July 14, 2014, death of inmate John Gleeson, 40, of Oceanside. The commission also said that the for-profit company ""has engaged in a pattern of inadequate and neglectful care.""

It came to a similar conclusion in the Feb. 10, 2014, death of Kevin Brown, 47, of Far Rockaway, in the Nassau jail, saying that his death of heart failure ""may have been prevented.""

""By law, the Commission of Correction and its Medical Review Board can -- and vigorously does -- investigate the quality of care provided by medical personnel or contracted medical providers,"" said commission spokeswoman Janine Kava. The commission also has regulations that detail how health services must be provided in county jails, and it conducts minimum standard evaluations of jails annually -- although the evaluation does not have to include health care, she said.

This is unlike hospitals and nursing homes, which undergo routine, extensive, surprise surveys by the state and/or the nonprofit Joint Commission and must be accredited to get federal Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements.

Michael Mushlin, a law professor at Pace University and vice chairman of the Correctional Association of New York, who has written extensively on prisoners' rights, said the difference is part of the larger problem of the closed nature of prisons and jails to regular outside scrutiny. ""If you have a closed institution, bad things are likely to happen; if you have oversight, you will lessen the likelihood of that,"" he said. ""The lack of oversight is appalling, not just for medical care but for everything.""

Jason Starr, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union's Nassau County chapter, agreed.

""It's the Wild West. No one knows what's happening,"" he said. ""There isn't that architecture of centralized oversight and accountability."" And, he said, there's little will to ensure that health care -- or any care -- is meeting quality standards.

""This isn't a hard thing,"" he said. ""Folks just don't want to do it.""

Dr. Robert Cohen, physician member of the New York City Board of Correction, which oversees health and mental health care in all of the city's correctional facilities, said there is an ""essential contradiction"" between providing medical care and keeping potentially dangerous people locked up.

""Providing health care for prisoners that meets minimal constitutional standards is possible, but not simple,"" said Cohen, who has also served as an independent monitor for the federal courts overseeing medical care for prisoners in several states. ""Medical care requires compassion and respect for a person's medical needs and autonomy, while jails are closed violent institutions which seek to maximize control and limit prisoner choice. Effective oversight of medical care in jails is necessary because of this essential contradiction, and requires both inside and outside monitoring according to medical, not correctional standards.""

Dr. Marc Stern, who was once medical director of the Albany county jail and now serves as a consultant for the U.S. Department of Justice to jails and prisons under investigation for their health care, said the issue is by no means limited to New York. ""There's no national requirement for uniform monitoring and accreditation of health care delivery within correctional facilities,"" he said.

He said that those places where the warden or superintendent is involved in the oversight of medical care tend to do better.

In New York, health services have topped the list of formal grievances filed by inmates in county jails for the past six years, according to the state commission's annual reports. Last year, they represented 22 percent of all grievances.

The state is not alone. Nationwide, 49 percent of county jail inmates, in a report published in February by the federal Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, said they were ""not at all satisfied"" with their medical care -- a higher percentage than state and federal prisoners.

Not a healthy group

According to the same report, 40 percent of jail inmates have at least one chronic condition, compared with 27 percent of the general population. Almost twice as many suffer from high blood pressure than the general population. They are three times more likely to have had an infectious disease such as hepatitis C and four times more likely to have HIV.

Among those with a chronic condition, about 40 percent said they were not taking their medication because they hadn't seen a doctor. And 36 percent said either the doctor thought medicine was unnecessary or the jail would not provide it.

Mental health problems also are rife in jails. Another Bureau of Justice Statistics' report published in 2006 -- the latest available -- found that 64 percent of jail inmates had a mental health problem. More than three-quarters of those who did also suffered from substance dependence or abuse. But, the report said, only 1 in 6, or about 17 percent, of jail inmates with mental health problems had received treatment since admission.

All of this takes its toll. Nationwide, the death rate in jails has been rising for the last three years even as the jail population decreased 4 percent, according to a third Bureau of Justice Statistics' report published in August. Suicide has been the leading cause of death in jails since 2000. In 2013, it accounted for 34 percent of jail inmate deaths. By contrast, in state prisons, suicide accounted for 5.5 percent of deaths and cancer is the leading killer, followed by heart disease.

New York had the sixth-highest number of jail deaths nationwide in 2013, the latest national statistics available. State commission statistics show that deaths in county jails alone jumped from 20 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. Of those, 16 in 2014 were suicides, compared with six the previous year.

Experts and advocates like Cohen said that the way to improve medical care is to have it monitored based on medical standards, not correctional standards. And jails, if they choose, can become accredited in health care by several not-for-profit organizations.

A leader in its field

The National Commission on Correctional Health Care is considered a leader in improving medical care in jails and prisons, but its reach is limited and its impact hard for an outsider to gauge.

Formed in the 1970s to advance health care in correctional facilities after an American Medical Association study of jails found inadequate health services and a lack of national standards, it offers a voluntary health services accreditation program for prisons, jails and juvenile detention facilities.

But only a small number of facilities have chosen to become accredited: about 500, about half of which are jails, according to commission spokesman Brent Gibson. The last official census in 2006 puts the number of state and federal prisons at 1,821 and the number of jails at 3,283.

Gibson said a list of commission-accredited facilities is not publicly available nor, he said, was the commission aware of any studies comparing the quality of health care at accredited facilities with those that are not.

The nonprofit American Correctional Association also offers voluntary accreditation that includes health care. Repeated attempts to contact someone at the organization were unsuccessful.

Of the 159 facilities listed by the association as accredited in New York, only two are county facilities, one a juvenile detention center in Erie County and the other, Westchester County's Norwood E. Jackson Correctional Center. The rest are state or federal facilities.

The nonprofit Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals and other health care facilities nationwide every three years following rigorous on-site visits, also accredits 65 federal prisons, according to Lon Berkeley, project director for community health center accreditation for the commission. But it has accredited ""less than a dozen"" jails and none in New York, he said.

The relative lack of accreditation and the growth of for-profit companies like Armor has fueled worries about the quality of medical care in jails among some advocates, who fear the for-profit companies have a strong financial incentive to deny care. No one appears to have a good idea of how many correctional facilities have outsourced health care nationally but Stern estimated that it is about half of local jails and state prisons. In New York, about a third of county jails' health units are run by for-profit companies.

""If it's cheaper to outsource health services, the quality of the health services that are going to be provided are not going to match the quality of publicly provided health services,"" said John Brickman, a lawyer in Great Neck and member of the board of directors of the Correctional Association of New York. ""You see it over and over again because somewhere there's a bean counter saying you're spending too much time with that patient, ordering too many tests and specialists.""

Nassau County hired Armor to administer medical care at an annual cost of $11 million, lowering the county's previous costs by $7 million a year.

An Armor spokeswoman has said that the company applies nationally recognized guidelines and ""has a proven record of delivering quality health care to more than 40,000 patient-inmates in eight states.""

Suffolk doesn't outsource

In Suffolk, county employees provide health care at the jails. This year, that care will cost about $12 million, including a $2.1 million contract with Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead to cover hospitalizations, according to the county legislature's Budget Review Office.

Stern, who once worked for the precursor of Corizon Health, the largest for-profit correctional health care company in the country, said that for-profit companies don't necessarily provide worse care.

""It's tempting to put a finger on private companies because they are a little more visible,"" he said. ""I'm not a big fan of private companies but that is focusing on the wrong issue.""

Asked what the issue is, he said: ""It's mostly money. The second part to it is it's [health care] not something society wants to see local government put a lot of money into. It's, 'Let them rot; they did something bad. We don't want them to get good things easily.' """,09/11/2015
NewsDay,"China needs to talk more about sex, not just kids","China's decision to allow all families to have two children rather than one has rightly been celebrated as a welcome expansion of reproductive rights. But the shift raises another question: What should the government do with the hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats who work for China's National Health and Family Planning Commission and its local offshoots, now that they'll have fewer fines to collect and births to prevent? If hard times befall these often brutal enforcers, no tears should be shed. But there might be a very good use for them: providing family planning services to China's rapidly changing society.

The need is dire. Over 70 percent of Chinese say they've had premarital sex. Yet almost none receive proper sex education or access to family planning services and counseling. HIV infections among students aged 15 and above are growing rapidly, and abortion has become the contraceptive of first resort for many Chinese couples.

Despite the fact that sex ed is required in Chinese schools, in practice it's rarely taught. The reasons include a lack of qualified instructors and curriculum (that's left up to local schools, who usually choose to do nothing), parental pressure to teach subjects that will be more useful in getting students into university and above all, the social conservatism that pervades official China. Traditional Confucian values, which Chinese leaders have embraced, preclude premarital sex for women at least, as well as public discussions of it.

The consequences of this official silence are plain to see. In 2010, Peking University, in cooperation with the United Nations Population Fund, conducted China's only national survey of youth access to and use of reproductive health services and education. Of 10,966 women between the ages of 15 and 25, only 4 percent displayed adequate knowledge of sexual and reproductive health, with those aged 15-19 the least knowledgeable. Sure enough, over half of those surveyed hadn't used contraception in their first sexual encounter. (Rates were even higher among migrant workers.) This week the Lancet published even more disturbing results from a large-scale national survey on the incidence of abortions among Chinese women. Of the 79,174 women surveyed in nearly 300 hospitals, 35 percent said they were having their first abortion, 37 percent their second, and 29 percent ""a third or subsequent abortion."" Half of the women blamed contraception failure for their pregnancies; 44 percent said they hadn't used contraception at all. Could education or other government- sponsored interventions have prevented some of these pregnancies? It's difficult to say, not least because single and LGBT Chinese aren't even eligible for government family planning services in China right now.

Fortunately, the Chinese government has many of the tools necessary to begin addressing these problems. Beyond mandating sex ed, officials need to start drafting, funding and imposing a national curriculum as soon as possible. Over the last two years, President Xi Jinping's administration has pressured colleges and universities across China to purify their textbooks of Western influence; the same determination can and should be brought to bear on sexual health.

Next, the Family Planning Commission needs to establish a program offering counseling services to couples after abortions, with a focus on increasing the use of contraceptives and reducing future unwanted pregnancies. Pilot programs in China over the last decade have shown clear successes and should be expanded.

Finally, it's essential that the commission and other government agencies recognize that unmarried Chinese, including the LGBT community and migrant laborers, needs their help as much as married couples. This will require a difficult change in mindset for a socially conservative government. But China's family planning issues are hardly exclusive to traditional couples, and universally available services would have broad, positive public health consequences. Long derided for interfering in its citizens' reproductive lives, the regime at least has the resources and personnel available to provide such services. It's time to try.

NewsDay,Chembio plans to start selling rapid test for malaria,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. plans to begin commercial sales of its recently developed rapid test for malaria, the Medford company announced Tuesday.

Company executives said recently completed research showed its DPP Malaria Assay had greater sensitivity than other point-of-care tests on the market in detecting plasmodium falciparum and other plasmodium infections.

The Chembio test identified ""the parasite infection at very low levels,"" said chief science officer Javan Esfandiari.

The malaria test was development in six months of this year. It will be sold commercially as part of a series of combination tests for malaria, Ebola and other fever diseases.

Malaria occurs in nearly 100 countries and strikes about 200 million people per year, according to the World Health Organization. Sales of rapid tests for the disease totaled 319 million units from all sources in 2013, up from 46 million in 2008.

Chembio is best known for its HIV and syphilis tests. The HIV tests are sold in the United States under the Clearview Complete name.

NewsDay,Meningitis vaccines now required for students in grades 7 through 12,"ALBANY - Students entering seventh and 12th grade in New York now will have to receive meningitis vaccinations, under a new law signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

The measure requires students in those grades to get vaccinated by Sept. 1, 2016. Previously, meningitis vaccinations were recommended but not required in New York.

More than 20 other states require the vaccinations, according to the law's legislative sponsors, state Sen. Kemp Hannon (R-Garden City) and Assemb. Aileen Gunther (D-Forestburgh). According to a memo they submitted with the legislation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that roughly 1,000 to 1,200 people contract meningococcal disease every year in the United States, and between 10 and 15 percent of these cases are fatal.

Among the supporters were groups that advocate for AIDS/HIV patients, such as the Gay Men's Health Crisis, whose chief executive, Kelsey Louie, said the new law ""will save lives from this silent killer.""

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV, Ebola, malaria and other diseases has reached agreement for a palm-sized reader made by a German company, opTricon of Berlin.

The reader will produce results for tests of sexually transmitted diseases, fever diseases and an undisclosed form of cancer. Chembio has blood tests or is developing them for each of these ailments.

The battery-powered reader has a camera capable of providing ""definitive diagnostic results for low analyte concentrations, which may otherwise result in faint or ambiguous test results,"" Chembio officials said. An analyte is a substance being subjected to chemical analysis.

The DPP Micro Reader also will be able to record and transmit test results.

""While point-of-care testing is a critical part of global health care, long-term success requires innovation that extends beyond the diagnostic test and includes data capture, transmission and storage,"" chief executive John J. Sperzel said. For some of Chembio's tests, the ""DPP Micro Reader will provide an innovative, cost-effective solution,"" he said.

Chembio shares fell 9 cents, or about 2 percent, to close at $4.88 on the Nasdaq Market Wednesday. The company's stock is up more than 24 percent since the start of the year.

Earlier this month, Chembio received a $2.1 million grant from the Paul G. Allen Ebola Program to develop an all-in-one test for six fever illnesses: malaria, dengue, Ebola, Lassa, Marburg and chikungunya. The one-year grant from the co-founder of Microsoft Corp. was seen as a major boost for the business.

NewsDay,Medical marijuana can help beat opioid epidemic,"Our nation now faces one of the worst drug epidemics in its history. Nearly 2 million Americans 12 and older have abused or are dependent on prescription opioids, costing an estimated $55.7 billion annually. At least 44 of these addicts die of an overdose every day.

As shocking as these numbers are, it is even more tragic knowing that an alternative medical option is being overlooked.

Today, a natural product is available that research indicates is effective in treating a number of conditions, including acute and chronic pain. Devoid of the addictive qualities of opioids, this substitute has never been credited with a single documented overdose death due to its own properties. By any other name, the validation process for medical marijuana would have been completed years ago; however, despite compelling evidence and data, we struggle as a nation to examine the merits of these claims.

Addiction to painkillers, particularly opioids, typically starts innocently when physicians prescribe them to patients suffering from acute, but temporary pain, such as post-operative surgery. Most patients do not become addicted. But, with more than 259 million prescriptions written annually, too often the result is a crippling dependence. Opioid addiction is a national problem that affects every socioeconomic and demographic group. Often hidden, it's tearing apart lives in cities, suburbs and rural areas.

Many opioid addicts eventually switch to heroin, either to save money or to satisfy their cravings. About 77 percent of heroin addicts begin as prescription opioid abusers. Corresponding with the growth in opioid prescriptions, the CDC reports that heroin use increased 63 percent between 2002 and 2013 and heroin-related overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled over the same period with more than 8,200 deaths in 2013.

A recent study by researchers at the RAND Corp. and the University of California found that in states where medical marijuana's products have been legal and made available to the public through regulated, medically focused dispensaries, opioid substance abuse declined by 15 percent, with a 31 percent reduction in opioid overdoses.

According to a preliminary analysis by Columbia Care of its national medical marijuana patient registry, 84 percent of its HIV/AIDS patients and 100 percent of its cancer patients noted that medical marijuana is significantly better than other treatments for pain management, including highly addictive opioids. Additionally, 73 percent of its medical marijuana patients discontinued other prescription pain medications subsequent to being given this alternative.

Most striking of all: While prescription opioid overdose leads to more than 22,700 deaths a year, there is not one documented and confirmed case of a person dying from an overdose of medical marijuana products.

We support a cautious approach and are committed to pursuing research with leading institutions. However, this epidemic is tearing our communities and families apart today. Now is the time to use medically focused and state-administered programs. This commitment does not require sweeping changes to the federal government's watchful stance. It merely requires collaboration among policymakers, qualified state-selected licensees and medical providers.

States that have medical marijuana programs are gathering enormous amounts of data -- we urge physicians and public health officials to examine this information carefully. As new evidence supports the use of medical marijuana as an alternative palliative therapy, the opportunity to reduce addiction and save lives makes this worthy of immediate and coordinated examination.",18/10/2015
NewsDay,For drug industry ignorance is bliss,"Ignorance may sometimes be bliss. But usually, ignorance makes problems worse.

For example, destructive ignorance underlies the myth that pharmaceutical companies routinely profiteer off the sick. Current aspirants to political office have recently invoked it, demanding price controls to relieve patients of high drug costs. But here's what they -- and even many health-care professionals -- are ignorant about.

First, health-care value has vastly improved thanks to the drugs and devices practitioners use to help patients, something I've witnessed firsthand practicing medicine for nearly 50 years.

Second, the predominant source of those advances has been innovative private pharmaceutical and medical device companies.

Third, contrary to assertions of prominent but ignorant authorities, government- and philanthropy-sponsored research contributes only marginally to practical discoveries and almost nothing to the difficult hurdles that transform such discoveries into clinically useful products.

A fourth and possibly most-damaging misunderstanding is the ignorance -- even denial -- of the difficulty and expense of that transformation.

The staggering cost to achieve FDA approval of a new drug -- the latest estimate being more than $2.5 billion -- is hard to comprehend, and the resultant incredulity abets cost-denial. But from experience of having tried to develop life-saving products, I know that the expenditures are real.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

And what it costs to discover, develop and produce a particular drug, and the health value that drug delivers have little relationship to what it costs to sustain the drug innovation enterprise. The reason for this contradiction is that nature's inscrutability causes seemingly promising projects to deliver poorer results than hoped. Many don't work well, don't work at all or cause harm.

This grim reality -- one that I have experienced all too often throughout my research career -- belies the Utopian notion that companies should market less and develop ""breakthroughs"" instead of derivative (""me-too"") drugs. But most progress is incremental, and it costs just as much to develop a marginally effective drug as a cure. Only sufficient profitability to attract investment permits taking enough risky chances to achieve rare successes. Furthermore, marketing is an antidote against ignorance.

To be sure, any large enterprise like the pharmaceutical industry will inevitably harbor individuals who exhibit unsavory behavior, as exemplified by recent blatant price gouging of a drug needed by vulnerable patients. But the circumstances of that incident, examined in greater depth than its media coverage, reveal yet another form of ignorance: confusing the industry that makes new drugs with the firms that really produce ""me-too"" (generic) imitations.

Although generics can certainly provide value at reduced cost, the particular price gouging case involved a generic drug. A better-aimed critical examination would target the government regulations overseeing production of such drugs and the cartels distributing them that discourage competition that inhibits such pricing misbehavior.

As a decent society we must spare patients ruinous drug costs. But we should do so in an informed manner that involves all stakeholders, not just pharmaceutical companies. High drug costs affect hospitals, pharmacies and especially health insurers. But they -- not the drug manufacturers -- are directly responsible for large co-payments patients suffer, and their profitability requirements are arguably less compelling than those of drug makers.

Furthermore, drug prices are only one of many contributors to these businesses' costs. An emergent deadly disease, such as HIV in the 1980s, stresses hospitals and insurers financially. But despite adding no health value and demanding no profits, it provides no easy scapegoat!

Ignorance regarding pharmaceuticals is hardly bliss: even price control threats reliably chase essential investors away from risky drug development. The latest political assault confirmed this truth. Ignorance is incompatible with drug innovation.

NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics wins $2.1M grant for test to detect Ebola virus, five other fever illnesses","A Medford company has won a $2.1 million grant from the co-founder of computer software giant Microsoft Corp. to develop a rapid test for six fever illnesses, including Ebola and malaria.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. said Wednesday it will use the one-year grant from the Paul G. Allen Ebola Program to develop an all-in-one blood test to detect malaria, dengue, Ebola, Lassa, Marburg and chikungunya. Allen co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975.

Chembio chief executive John J. Sperzel said the six illnesses are characterized by a high-grade fever and can be fatal when not treated appropriately. In many parts of the world, these diseases are commonly misdiagnosed, resulting in delayed treatment or failure to properly treat the underlying infection, he said.

""We plan to have this fever panel [test] in the field in 12 months"" for testing, Sperzel said in an interview. ""We are well on our way because this builds on our work with malaria and Ebola.""

Chembio's point-of-care tests for malaria and malaria/Ebola are being tried out in West Africa by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

He said other companies have introduced rapid tests for a single disease but Chembio stands out for its combination tests. It also has tests for HIV and syphilis, and a combination HIV/syphilis test.

Sperzel said the funding announced Wednesday represents Chembio's largest single grant. It follows a six-month grant of between $300,000 and $400,000 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Chembio also has received three rounds of funding from the CDC.

The grants ""help secure jobs at our Long Island headquarters,"" Sperzel said. The company has 150 employees; 35 work in research and development.

The Chembio grant was one of seven, totaling $11 million, announced Wednesday by Allen's Ebola eradication program. A year ago, Allen pledged $100 million to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. His Seattle-based Vulcan Inc. administers the grants.

The West Africa Ebola outbreak ""exposed significant gaps in the world's ability to effectively contain emerging infectious diseases,"" Vulcan president Barbara Bennett said.

Point-of-care diagnostics ""were a clear gap in the early days of the Ebola response,"" she said. ""While the world cannot stop every outbreak, we can apply innovative solutions to more effectively fill the gaps to ensure that the next outbreak doesn't become the next epidemic.""

There are, of course, a vast number of series that went on to become films (most often long after the series wrapped) and some which even went on to extend the mythology and story on to that big silver screen -- ""Star Trek"" is the usual go-to example, and next is ""The X Files.""

But while I may not speak for every Trekkie among us, I think there's a sound argument to be made for a case that the movie franchise, or at least certain films comprising it, did not necessarily improve upon the show or shows (because the movies grew out of the spin offs).

I do think there's an airtight argument to be made for a case that says the ""X Files"" movies were not only vastly inferior to the series, but even diminished its considerable accomplishments. I'm not about to make one of those ""TV is Better Than Movies"" case here. That's ridiculous, a pointless argument.

But there is a creative challenge involved in making the leap, plus a sense among fans that they've been cheated: Oh, we didn't wrap the series! Too bad, sucker: You'll have to pay 15 bucks for the movie.

Another issue is simply a profound disconnect: The TV series -- ""GoT,"" in this instance -- is part of the Hivemind, which must explore every nuance of its cherished object in real time, and then do some more masticating the next day, in a thousand TV posts, and a million more tweets, etc. Movies -- even great ones -- are one-and-done affairs. Of course there will be a vast amount of social media interaction, but there's a finite aspect to it because those who have seen the movie already know the end.

Another challenge: ""The Sopranos"" movie, as an example, wasn't made because David Chase had enough sense, I think, to leave well enough alone. He already finished his great triumph, in a scene that faded to snow. Millions of fans howled, but it was genius, in hindsight. Tony's fate became, in a sense, what you wanted it to become. He could live. He could die. Your choice, based on whatever you thought was appropriate, morally, or narratively.

Do you or anyone honestly think that could have been improved upon in a MOVIE? It could have easily been destroyed: A movie that would only serve to demolish the intellectual and aesthetic framework that Chase had left in place.

So no: Let's get over this idea that a ""GoT"" movie is a grand and glorious idea that must happen. The series, this great series, is where it began and should end.

I will add one important postscript: There is little chance ""GoT,"" the series, will be able to include the final two books of ""Ice and Fire."" ""A Dream of Spring"" may well be years away, even longer if Martin has to keep denying movie rumors. A movie may -- and I would add only MAY -- be a way to one day incorporate both books. But a case could also be made for a spin off series, too.

Meanwhile, here's the rest of what Martin had to say about the non-movie:

""Let me review, for those who came in late. The idea of ending GAME OF THRONES with one or more major feature films was first floated oh, three or four years ago. Let me say once again: this was NOT MY IDEA.

""However, I may have been the first one to mention the notion in public -- where and how I no longer recall -- so somehow I became associated with it. I did say that I liked the idea. Of course I liked the idea.

""How not? This was back in the early days, where we couldn't even afford to shoot the Battle of the Green Fork and had to knock Tyrion unconscious instead. When the king's hunting party consisted of four guys on foot walking through the woods.

""At that time, in that context, the idea of big blockbuster movies with a LORD OF THE RINGS sized budget was powerfully attractive.""

He goes on to say that the idea remains ""powerfully attractive. Not just to me, but to many people connected with the show. Actors, directors, producers, writers. How not? It would be a great way to end.""

He then ends the whole rant with this: ""Don't take any of this stuff seriously. Clickbait journalism is to journalism as military music is to music.""",01/10/2015
NewsDay,Danny Pintauro of 'Who's the Boss?' reveals he's HIV positive,"Former child star Danny Pintauro, who came out as gay in 1997, said over the weekend that he is HIV positive and plans to become a safe-sex activist.

""I'm HIV positive, and I have been for 12 years,"" Pintauro, 39, told Oprah Winfrey Saturday on ""Oprah: Where Are They Now?"" ""It's not something that people are talking about right now, really. When I first came out . . . I missed the opportunity,"" he lamented, ""to be a beacon of light for gay kids who were going through what I was going through.""

Shortly before the interview aired, he posted an Instagram photo of himself and husband Wil Tabares, whom he married in April 2014, captioned, ""Last meal as a nobody. ;) first meal as an activist.""

Pintauro, who played Jonathan Bower on the 1984 to 1992 ABC sitcom ""Who's the Boss?,"" told Winfrey he was diagnosed in March 2003 while living in New York. ""I went in for a regular checkup. You know, as a responsible gay man, you're getting an HIV test done every six months.""

When he learned he had tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, which can lead to AIDS, he felt, he said, ""a weird combination of feelings. There's this awful feeling of, 'I'm never going to be able to have a good relationship. No one's ever going to want me.' That was there and that was prevalent. You know, that moment of 'Oh God, I'm now going to have to have that conversation every time I meet someone. Who's going to want to love me?' ""

He added happily that on his first date with his husband-to-be, ""It was the first thing I told him. And the first thing he said was, 'I'm not scared of it at all.' """,27/09/2015
NewsDay,Families of suicide victims share stories at Long Beach walk,"When Angelo Cervasio returned from the U.S. Air Force, he grew ""isolated"" and rarely spoke of his time in the service, his mother, Virginia Cervasio, recalled.

But she considered the stoicism a mark of his military training.

""We thought the Air Force made a man out of him,"" she said Sunday. But his suicide on Jan. 17, 2006, and a goodbye note that offered no explanation, puzzled his grieving family.

Cervasio was speaking on a bandwagon facing the Long Beach boardwalk, at the seventh annual suicide prevention event, ""Let's Walk Let's Talk.""

Organizers from the Long Island Crisis Center in Bellmore have worked to ""destigmatize suicide,"" said Fran Karliner, the center's director of development.

Suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In recent years, the outreach has been tailored to veterans. In response to the growing number of veteran suicides nationally, the crisis center began the Saving Our Long Island Veterans initiative. According to a 2013 Department of Veterans Affairs study, a veteran commits suicide every 65 minutes.

Since the initiative began, the center has heard from an average of two veterans a day calling the confidential hotline. Karliner said she believes the veterans are comfortable asking for help anonymously.

""Because they are trained to be self-sufficient, it almost is a stigma in itself to ask for help,"" Karliner said.

At the event, relatives of suicide victims shared stories before walking on the boardwalk, while some held posters remembering their loved ones. About 400 people attended the event, Karliner said.

Jill Estes, an HIV navigator at Pride For Youth, a project of the crisis center, said workers struggle with the high suicide rates in the community for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning youth. ""It's very important we have visibility here,"" Estes said. ""A lot of things don't really emphasize inclusion for the LGBTQ youth.""

Angelo Cervasio, who died at age 24, was a graduate of Locust Valley High School, and is buried at the Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale. He had worked in communications management in the Air Force in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.

Virginia Cervasio said looking back, her son ""had all the signs"" associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.

""We weren't educated,"" said Cervasio, who launched a nonprofit aimed at suicide prevention. ""We didn't know the signs.""",20/09/2015
NewsDay,Faceoff over medical marijuana dispensary in Riverhead continues at public hearing,"Medical marijuana advocates, some battling severe illnesses or caring for sick relatives, packed Riverhead Town Hall Wednesday to urge officials to allow Suffolk County's first dispensary of the drug to open in January.

Riverhead officials are considering imposing a 1-year moratorium on marijuana dispensaries that would block Columbia Care NY LLC's plans to open one at a former Blockbuster video store on Route 58 in Riverhead, one of two planned for Long Island.

Donna Schwier, 58, a registered nurse from Medford, said at the public hearing that she lives in constant pain due to fibromyalgia and would like to use marijuana instead of the opiates she relies on.

""I'm tired of being in pain every day, and I want to have this option,"" Schwier said. ""I live in Suffolk, and this is going to be my dispensary.""

Riverhead Town Board members said at the hearing that they supported medical marijuana but wanted a moratorium to consider appropriate locations for a dispensary. Officials have expressed concerns about traffic and policing costs, and the site's proximity to Riverhead High School.

""We know there's a need, we want it in the Town of Riverhead, but we want it at a location that's right,"" said Councilman John Dunleavy, who proposed the moratorium.

Riverhead Supervisor Sean Walter has said his desire for a moratorium stems from his belief that the state's passage of medical marijuana is a steppingstone to legalization of recreational marijuana.

At the hearing's end, Walter and Columbia Care chief executive Nicholas Vita agreed to meet further about a location for a dispensary.

Just one person spoke in favor of the moratorium during the two-hour hearing: Felicia Scocozza, director of the Riverhead Community Awareness Program, a drug and alcohol prevention organization.

Shesaid the moratorium ""will give the town the time to thoughtfully study the impact"" of the dispensary.

More than a dozen people spoke in favor of allowing the facility to open as soon as possible, saying it represents a long-awaited hope for county residents suffering from HIV, cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and other illnesses.

Julie Baum, 48, said she temporarily moved from East Hampton to Colorado to obtain a non-psychoactive form of marijuana for her 10-year-old son, who suffers from a severe form of epilepsy.

""This is about healing,"" said Baum, an East Hampton acupuncturist who is a cancer survivor. ""This is about medicine. This is not about recreational use. We have to take the stigma away from this beautiful 2,000 year old herb, and view it as medicine.""

Vince Taldone, 55, of Riverhead, said the town board's resistance is ""misguided"" in a town trying to build itself into a commercial hub.

""You've created this regional shopping center, you have eight pharmacies there, you have oxycontin available down the block from the school."" Taldone said. ""I'm deeply insulted by people who say a medical marijuana dispensary would generate a need for police. Are sick people causing crimes?""

Columbia Care, based in Manhattan, was one of five companies licensed by state officials in July to manufacture and distribute marijuana under the Compassionate Care Act passed by the State Legislature in June 2014.

Columbia Care NY is permitted to manufacture the drug upstate and open four dispensaries, including the one in Riverhead.

""This is about the patients,"" Vita, the company's chief executive, said at the hearing. ""This is about people who shouldn't be ashamed to look for these types of treatment.""",16/09/2015
NewsDay,Where to buy fresh honey on Long Island,"Long Island is swarming with honeybees -- at least, that's what the growing membership of the Long Island Beekeepers Club suggests. This is good news for farmers and gardeners who rely on bees to pollinate their plants, and of course for anyone who loves honey.

KEEPING A COLONY

Fourth generation beekeeper Margaret Barna's family collected honey in Poland, Belgium and upstate New York before establishing BarnaBee Honey in Ronkonkoma. So it's on good authority that she proclaims Long Island honey the world's best, its smooth, soft, supple flavor the product of a seacoast climate and a unique combination of wildflowers. Mary Woltz, owner of Bees' Needs in Sag Harbor, agrees that ""the wide variety of nectars found on Long Island make our honey special.""

And when you buy honey, you are supporting the community. ""Buying local honey helps everyone,"" says Woltz. ""The farmer who gives the beekeeper a home for the bees, the natural landscape that benefits from the bees' activities and the honey consumer who quite literally tastes the place or terroir.""

Beekeepers focus on caring for their colonies, providing optimal conditions for them to gather nectar from flowers and bring it back to the hives. Human handling has very little to do with the final product. Inside the hive, the bees do all the work, beating their wings to create the breeze that will evaporate water from the stored nectar, transforming it into the thick, viscous substance that we pour into our tea. Unlike commercial producers, who boil and filter their honey, sometimes diluting it with cheap high fructose corn syrup, artisanal producers don't do much in the way of processing. Heating honey destroys its healthful enzymes as well its beautiful aroma. Filtering it removes pollen particles some believe relieve seasonal allergies.

Whether you are buying honey for culinary or medicinal purposes, make sure you are getting raw, unfiltered honey from Long Island. The best way to do so? Read labels, but more importantly, know your beekeepers.

""Go to the bee yard. Look at the hives. Taste the honey,"" says Wayne Vitale of Spy Coast Bee Farm in Setauket. Woltz agrees. ""Many beekeepers supplement their production by buying nonlocal honey, so unless you know your beekeepers and their practices, you cannot be certain you are enjoying the best benefits of eating local honey.""

Contact Mary Woltz at Bees' Needs (631-702-5657, mgwoltz@optonline.net) for more information on $100 shares for twelve half-pound jars and $200 shares for twelve one-pound jars of Bees' Needs Honey.

HOW TO DECRYSTALLIZE HONEY

Thickening and crystallization of honey are not signs of spoilage, but rather an inevitable but not irreversible stage. The glucose in honey tends to form crystals on other crystals, or on small particles like pollen. The more opportunities that glucose has to form crystals, the more quickly crystallization will occur. Commercial honey, which has been heated to dissolve existing glucose crystals and filtered to remove pollen, is less likely to crystallize than raw, unfiltered honey.

To reliquefy your honey, place the whole jar (glass jars only; plastic containers shouldn't be heated) in hot but not boiling water (about 100 degrees) and gently warm it until it reaches the consistency you desire. Your honey should remain liquid and smooth for at least a month, if stored at a temperature of 70 degrees. Between 55 and 60 degrees, it will start to recrystallize more quickly. Repeated heating of honey will cause it to lose its aroma, so if you are using yours very slowly, reheat a little at a time, rather than reheating the whole jar over and over again.",07/08/2015
NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics sales drop, loss widens","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. Thursday reported losses that more than quadrupled in the April-June period compared with a year earlier as sales fell and operating expenses rose.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV and syphilis said losses totaled $664,000 in the three months ended June 30. That compares with a loss of $146,000 in the same quarter in 2014.

Sales in the period fell more than 9 percent to $6.7 million.

Despite the lower results, Chembio chief executive John J. Sperzel III expressed confidence in the potential for the company's point-of-care testing technology, called DPP. He said it ""offers industry-leading sensitivity and specificity, and the ability to test simultaneously for multiple diseases with a single patient sample.""

Under Sperzel, Chembio has developed a U.S. sales team and expanded use of its tests beyond HIV to research projects involving an undisclosed form of cancer, Ebola and tropical diseases.

In a teleconference with stock analysts, he said the company will deliver a combination test for Ebola and malaria to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for evaluation by Sept. 30. He also said clinical trials for a combined HIV and syphilis test will begin before year's end.

Chembio's revenue from research, grants and royalty payments increased in the second quarter, helping to offset a 13 percent drop in sales of the rapid tests.

Chembio's cash on June 30 was $1.6 million compared with $4.6 million at the end of 2014.

The company said the reduction ""was primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of $2.17 million, as well as investing activities to fund the purchase of a license and deposits on and the purchase of fixed assets of $880,000.""

Chief financial officer Richard J. Larkin said in the conference call that Chembio could borrow up to $2 million from HSBC if need be.

Larkin also said Chembio is working to reduce its accounts receivable balance, which is ""double our historical levels.""

Sperzel said he had met with an unidentified customer and is confident payments would be forthcoming by year's end.

NewsDay,"Nassau, Suffolk each will get a medical marijuana dispensary","ALBANY -- Nassau and Suffolk counties each will get one medical marijuana dispensary, but no manufacturing sites, state officials said Friday in announcing the selection of five companies to run medical marijuana operations across New York.

The announcement represented a major step in the launch of the new medical treatment program meant for patients with a variety of eligible diseases, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis.

Each company will run four dispensaries, for a total of 20 statewide. The program starts Jan. 5, or when the system is certified by the state Health Department and the State Police.

None of the six Long Island companies vying for the lucrative licenses was chosen. Forty-three companies statewide put in bids.

Columbia Care NY LLC will manufacture the drug in the upstate Rochester area and run four dispensaries, including one in Riverhead. Columbia CEO Nicholas Vita said the company is looking at a site on Old County Road as a dispensary location but plans to first do ""community outreach."" He called the dispensary ""simply a pharmacy,"" and said support for medicinal use of the drug is growing.

""I think public opinion on medical marijuana has turned,"" Vita said.

Bloomfield Industries Inc. was selected to manufacture medical marijuana in Queens and run four dispensaries, including one in Nassau. Bloomfield, headquartered on Staten Island, didn't return calls or emails Friday.

The selection of the five winners completed a short, intensive competition in which companies invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to demonstrate viability. Companies had to show supply and research controls and have labor agreements in place, among other factors.

Two other winners will have manufacturing sites, or ""grow centers,"" in the North Country, in Fulton and Warren counties; the third will be in the mid-Hudson region in Orange County.

Among the losing bidders was North Shore-LIJ Health System, which partnered with a Colorado-based cannabis company to form Silverpeak NY LLC to put together a bid.

""The North Shore-LIJ Health System and the founding partners of Silverpeak Apothecary believe they put forth a strong application that would have established a highly professional cultivation and dispensing operation to help eligible New Yorkers better manage the symptoms of their illnesses,"" North Shore-LIJ spokesman Terry Lynam said in an email.

""Although Silverpeak NY was not chosen to administer the program, we support the state's efforts and fully anticipate North Shore-LIJ physicians and patients will be participating,"" Lynam said.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, initially had opposed medical marijuana. But with support rapidly increasing among state legislators, he reached an agreement to launch the program -- although he has the power to quash it at any time.

Medical marijuana advocates applauded the milestone, but said they had concerns because New York is the strictest among more than 20 states with programs. ""The distribution of dispensaries around the state remains a major concern,"" Julie Netherland, deputy state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. The nonprofit backs drug policy reform.

""Given the current proposed sites, there are huge areas of the state where patients will have to travel enormous distances to get medicine,"" she said. ""This is especially problematic given that many medical marijuana patients are sick and disabled and low income.""",31/07/2015

NewsDay,Debate: Should Congress lighten criminal sentences?,"President Barack Obama recently visited a federal prison in Oklahoma as part of his effort to build support for changes to the criminal justice system.

The president deplored the sharp increase in the prison population over the past 35 years and said, ""We have to consider whether this is the smartest way for us to control crime."" Republicans in Congress sound amenable to some reforms. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, is working to have a bill ready before the August recess that would give judges more discretion in sentencing some drug offenders.

Does it make sense for Congress to ease federal sentencing laws? Joel Mathis and Ben Boychuk, the RedBlueAmerica columnists, weigh in.

JOEL MATHIS: Viewed from certain angles, the United States looks little better than a totalitarian state.

Consider these numbers from The Sentencing Project: -In the last two generations, America's state and federal prisons have seen their populations explode from just more than 200,000 in 1960 to a hair past 1.6 million in 2013.

-The U.S. imprisons more than 700 out of every 100,000 citizens - first in the world. Even Russia only puts 475 out of every 100,000 citizens behind bars.

-Total state spending on prisons was $6.7 billion in 1985 - and $51.9 billion in 2013.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

-A whopping 50.7 percent of federal prisoners are serving time for drug crimes.

-If you're an American man, you have a one-in-nine chance of being jailed in your lifetime. If you're a black American male, the chances are one-in-three.

All this imprisoning tears apart families, makes it difficult to obtain legitimate work, and generally hurts the fabric of our society. And they're hives of mental illness - some created by the prison experience - a place to dump the confused bodies of men and women who simply can't function decently in polite society.

The result? People who do get out frequently lack the skills to do anything but go back in sooner rather than later.

So the system is expensive and disruptive. And if it once seemed to reduce crime, well, most people can now agree it does more harm than good.

""Our prisons should be a place where we can train people for skills that can help them find a job, not train them to become more hardened criminals,"" Obama said recently. ""We have to make sure that as they do their time and pay back their debt to society, that we are increasing the possibility that they can turn their lives around."" Reducing minimum sentences is just one step among many needed to achieve that goal. But yes, we should take it immediately.

BEN BOYCHUK: It's rare to find bipartisan agreement on anything these days, in large part because bipartisanship is for suckers. But on the question of reforming the federal criminal justice system, political consensus is welcome. Being ""tough on crime"" doesn't require stubborn refusal to change in the face of certain realities.

One such reality is that not all drug offenses are worthy of prison time. Some states have already figured this out. Until last year, California had a highly effective drug court program that diverted thousands of potential felons from prison and into treatment. If convicts successfully completed treatment and found gainful employment, their conviction would be expunged.

And if they dropped out? Directly to prison they would go, with a nasty felony on their record.

Giving judges the flexibility to try certain offenders in drug court was good for society and good for taxpayers. Recidivism rates declined and county governments saved money on incarceration costs.

Another reality is that mandatory minimum sentences are akin to school zero-tolerance policies. When soulless bureaucratic automatons mete out harsh punishments for ""offenses"" that no sane person would consider dangerous, let alone wrong, people begin to hold the law in contempt.

Removing the human element - fairness, proportion, basic common sense - from criminal proceedings may prevent some liberal judges from being too lenient. But it's hardly conducive to justice.

Congress may relax rigid sentencing rules, but legislators would do well to address the more pernicious problem of ""overcriminalization."" Right on Crime, the Texas Public Policy Center's criminal justice reform project, notes that the Constitution ""lists only three federal crimes, but the number of statutory federal crimes has now swelled to around 4,500."" Many of those crimes are so obscure and picayune that civil liberties lawyer Harvey Silverglate claims Americans may be unwittingly committing as many as three felonies a day.

Could anything better exemplify a government without limits or accountability? Any worthwhile reform would tackle overcriminalization first and foremost. Fewer federal crimes would mean fewer minimum mandatory sentences, and the prison population would decline as a matter of course.

NewsDay,Greg Louganis 'honored and humbled' by HBO documentary 'Back on Board',"Greg Louganis was among the biggest sports stars of the 1980s, winning gold medals in both platform and springboard diving in both the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games.

But he never fully cashed in on marketing that stardom, in part because of rumors that he was gay, something he later confirmed publicly, along with the fact he is HIV positive.

HBO looks back at all of that, and what Louganis' life is like today, in ""Back on Board,"" a documentary that premieres at 10 p.m. Tuesday. At 55, he has become a vocal advocate for LGBT causes.

""I am so thrilled, honored and humbled; this film has the power to saves,"" Louganis said after a screening in Manhattan.

The first time he saw the film, he said, ""It was a little awkward, because I was seeming to make the same mistakes over and over again and that's a little embarrassing. When am I going to learn this lesson? You're going to learn it when you're ready to learn it.""

Louganis is seen in the film in recent years dealing with financial problems, including the threat of losing his longtime California home.

He said he trusted director Cheryl Furjanic with telling his tale, flaws and all.

NewsDay,Indie '80s at BAM: Essential films,"There's a common and altogether unfortunate misconception that the '80s were a time of glossy corporate junk at the movies.

In fact, the indie spirit was alive and well throughout the decade, a fact made abundantly clear by the ""Indie '80s"" series running at BAM through the end of August.

This is an extraordinarily robust program that spans the breadth of creative, off-the-beaten-path cinema made during the Reagan Years.

Iconic documentaries such as Errol Morris' ""The Thin Blue Line"" play adjacent to horror classics like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" David Lynch's unforgettable ""Blue Velvet"" and the coming-of-age crime pic ""River's Edge,"" starring a young Crispin Glover and Keanu Reeves.

Those are some of the movies you've heard of -- others include Spike Lee's debut ""She's Gotta Have It"" and ""My Dinner with Andre.""

Then there are the new discoveries, the pictures that remain so far below the mainstream radar it's possible to discover them fresh. ""Parting Glances,"" starring Steve Buscemi, offers an early look at HIV's effect on NYC's gay community. Jon Jost's ""Bell Diamond"" explores a Vietnam veteran's struggles. ""Will,"" a 16mm picture shot in Harlem, tells the story of a boy adopted by a basketball coach and his wife, and is considered the first modern independent film made by an African-American woman (Jessie Maple).",19/07/2015
NewsDay,"Beware Portuguese man-of-war, in water and on shore","From Jones Beach to Montauk Point, beachgoers encountering venomous Portuguese man-of-wars should beware: Even when washed up on shore -- alive or dead -- the animal's tentacles can cause a jolt of pain.

The man-of-wars, normally found in warmer waters, began showing up here at the end of last month. What brought them ""is a combination of wind, waves and current,"" said Bill Wise, director of New York Sea Grant. ""They tend to clump together in groups. There may be a couple hundred in a group. If the wind persists long enough from the south, it might wash most of them up.""

Three people, including two children, were stung Tuesday on Fire Island. On Saturday, the fourth annual Fire Island Ocean Swim is being held on the barrier island, starting in Atlantique.

Southampton Town trustee Ed Warner Jr. was stung in Florida when he was a teen. ""They're nasty,"" he said. ""It left a mark on my leg that stayed for a number of years. It was like a tattoo.""

A man-of-war is not a true jellyfish, but a siphonophore -- a collection of organisms that includes a bladder and tentacles that can reach 30 feet. The bladder part floats above the water and looks like an old warship.

""If you see a man-of-war, you kind of want to get away from it,"" said Dr. Sanjey Gupta, chief of emergency medicine at Franklin Hospital in Valley Stream.

""It can cause an injury that looks almost like a whip,"" Gupta said.

Jellyfish stings often are treated with vinegar, but Gupta said that could worsen a man-of-war sting. If you are stung by a man-of-war, here is his advice:

Remove the tentacle using a towel, stick or other utensil -- not your bare fingers. Clean the wound with seawater, not freshwater, which Gupta said could spread the toxin. Be sure not to get sand in the wound.

Once the injured area is clean, soak with warm water for 15 to 20 minutes. Freshwater can be used at this point. The pain should stop within an hour.

Seek medical treatment immediately if you experience difficulty breathing or have chest pains, a serious rash with hives or severe muscle cramping.

NewsDay,Company vying for medical marijuana license offers $5 million in research grants,"ALBANY - A pharmaceutical company competing for one of the state's five medical marijuana licenses pledged Monday to provide $5 million in research grants, including $1 million to Stony Brook University.

Fiorello Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is based in New York City, announced Monday that it would fund the research into medical marijuana uses if it secures a license to provide the drug.

""The private sector and state governments must step in to fill the unconscionable void in medical marijuana research created by the federal classification of marijuana"" as a narcotic, said Fiorello CEO Ari Hoffnung Monday.

The legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo adopted New York's medical marijuana law last year. The law strictly limits marijuana to smokeless forms for serious medical conditions including epilepsy, cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis and ALS, which is commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

The state Health Department is evaluating proposals by more than 100 companies competing for the licenses, with each offering incentive packages. Operations and dispensing of medical marijuana is scheduled to begin Jan. 5.

At Stony Brook University, the grant would allow continued research into understanding how medical marijuana can treat diseases that include childhood epilepsy, said Dale G. Deutsch, professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Stony Brook.

Fiorello Pharmaceuticals also pledged to provide $1 million in research grants over five years to facilities in the Albany area where the company would have part of its medical marijuana operation. The balance of $3 million would go to clinicians and researchers statewide, the company stated.

NewsDay,Larry Kramer turns 80 with 'Love & Anger' documentary,"Larry Kramer, the AIDS activist, author and playwright (""The Normal Heart""), turned 80 on Thursday. On Monday at 9 p.m., HBO celebrates this singular life with ""Larry Kramer in Love and Anger,"" produced and directed by Jean Carlomusto, professor of Media Arts and Director of the Television Center at LIU Post in Brookville.

A New Hyde Park native, Carlomusto has been associated with Kramer for more than 30 years, beginning with the Gay Men's Health Crisis and then ACT UP (Kramer's breakaway group from GMHC). The film includes documentary footage Carlomusto collected over the years, including as video archivist for the GMHC, revealing a complex, angry, passionate, difficult and, above all, talented writer/activist who catalyzed an entire movement, and changed history.

I spoke with Carlomusto last week.

How's Kramer's health? (he's bedridden at the opening the film -- the result of a liver transplant and years of battling HIV).

He's doing great. I was in Provincetown with him a few days ago, and [friends] had a birthday dinner party for him, and after he blew out the candles on his cake, he looked up and yelled, '80 [expletive] years!' He's still got it. He's still fighting back.

How did you meet?

I was in the Gay Men's Health Crisis and worked there for seven years -- he started GMHC in 1981 and was the driving force. The story of ""The Normal Heart"" talks about this, which is actually a pretty clear historical description of what went down in the early days of AIDS. [But] when I came to GMHC, he was gone. He was still very much a subject of discussion there, and so when I heard he was organizing this protest at Wall Street that would later become the first action of ACT UP, I ran down there with my camera, and stayed with ACT UP until the early '90s.

You and HBO use the term ""complex"" to describe Kramer. Complex in what way?

Sign up for Newsday's Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs, TV and more. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

He is complex, and I like complex subjects because in the complexities you find the truth, and oftentimes truth is complex. The truth here is he's a very shy and sensitive man. But he is also a rambunctious rabble rouser.

Not a contradiction?

That's why I really wanted to go into his childhood [in the film] where you can see the seeds of everything right there -- a mother who taught her sons they had a moral responsibility to make contributions to their community [but] also a father who saw nothing good in his son -- who liked theater, movies, singing. He called his son a sissy. [Kramer] learned to fight back against his father, to defend himself. . . . He proved his father wrong.

What's he doing now?

He's working on a number of projects [and] he's writing a screenplay for ""The Normal Heart,"" part two -- it's more centered around ACT UP, and one of the things he wanted to investigate further [is] what happened -- how it became successful and how it turned on itself.",26/06/2015

NewsDay,The evolution of gay pride,"After being denied a parade permit in 1991 by Huntington because only traditional parades -- Memorial Day and St. Patrick's Day, for instance -- were allowed on town streets, we decided to go to court.

We eventually won the right to celebrate gay pride on Long Island. And today, the gay-rights movement's fight for equality continues to win court battles locally, statewide and in the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1991, we marched down Main Street in Huntington as a call to arms. It was, and remains, our hometown, and we didn't have to go to Manhattan to be ourselves and live freely. We marched to the sound of both protesters and supporters with pride and for a cause. And nearly 25 years later, gay pride events have become more of a big party than a summons to action.

Attendance at Long Island Pride events has quadrupled in the last four years, even given dwindling parade spectators on parade -- thousands more can be found inside Heckscher Park in Huntington for the annual festival.

Gay pride must be festive and driven by political action. Their coexistence should shape our annual celebrations. The landscape for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families has significantly improved in the last 25 years, with increased visibility, legislation, support and opportunities to celebrate our love and identities. But for many LGBT people, the consequences and fears of being out are still too much of a risk, and the data show us why.

In U.S. schools, nearly two-thirds of LGBT youth hear anti-gay remarks daily, 30 percent report missing school at least one day because of feeling unsafe and more than 85 percent are verbally harassed, according to a survey from the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network. Nearly one-third of teen suicides are committed by LGBT youth. And up to 40 percent of runaway and homeless youth identify as LGBT.

While the conversation about transgendered Americans has taken a huge leap with the hiring of actress Laverne Cox, a cast member in ""Orange Is the New Black,"" and Caitlyn Jenner's story, transgendered people still lack basic protections against discrimination in housing and the workplace.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

While Suffolk County and North Hempstead town have adopted limited protections, Nassau County has not and the State Senate, led by Long Island Republicans, refuses to allow a vote on the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act.

Also, health disparities among the LGBT community are well documented.

Gay and bisexual men are the fastest-growing group in newly diagnosed HIV infections.

Lesbians are at higher risk for cancer and less likely to get preventive services.

Transgender individuals are less likely to have health insurance than heterosexual or LGB individuals.

And elderly LGBT people face additional barriers as a result of severe isolation and a lack of social services.

Despite the daunting challenges, there are reasons to be optimistic. In a landslide victory last month, Ireland became the first nation in the world to adopt same-sex marriage by popular vote. Although I oppose putting civil rights up for a vote, Ireland's tally proved that being out and visible can move hearts and minds in profound ways. And we are expecting a historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling that could extend same-sex marriage to all 50 states.

There is a lot to celebrate tomorrow at the Long Island Gay Pride Parade in Huntington. But we must remember that our fight is not over; scores of Long Islanders will stay home, as the fear of being ""out"" is still too much to overcome.

During this year's pride celebrations, let's honor our past, celebrate the victories and be visible for those who can't.",12/06/2015
NewsDay,Caitlyn Jenner's gender war on pronouns,"Keeping the pronouns straight. In my experience, that's the hardest part of adjusting to a friend's sex-change operation.

My experience in this case consists of working in the same newsroom as Ridgely Hunt, an award-winning war correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, as he became Nancy Hunt in the mid-1970s.

Or as Nancy probably would prefer to hear me say, she was always Nancy; it only took the help of modern gender-reassignment surgery to let her reveal her true feminine self in public.

That's my pronoun problem. Even today it's hard for me to talk about ""her"" award-winning coverage of the Vietnam War, for example, when that coverage was published under ""his"" byline when he was still a ""he.""

A Yale graduate from a Social Register family and veteran of two wars, Hunt was known for taking on dangerous assignments with gifted writing skills. His -- her? -- reputation for macho stories only made Hunt's changes from a ""him"" to a ""her"" all the more astonishing to the rest of us.

After her final operation in 1978, she feared her editors might try to fire her, but instead she was reassigned to inside work on the editing desks. She wrote an autobiography, ""Mirror Image,"" that year. She was profiled in People magazine and grilled by the audience on Phil Donahue's TV show. She was even immortalized by Hollywood when a clip from that show was included in the Brian DePalma thriller ""Dressed to Kill"" to give a touch of real-life authenticity to its plot.

Hunt retired in 1984, remarried and died in 1999 at age 72 as Nancy Hunt Bowman.

""All the years as a man I would look in the mirror and hate myself,"" she told People in 1978. ""Now I'm an avowed sexual freak. Yet I look in that mirror, and after a lifetime of self-loathing I can say, 'Hey, I like me'.""

Those days come back to mind as I once again wrestle with the proper pronouns for former Olympic decathlon champ Bruce Jenner, who famously has become the eerily familiar-looking Caitlyn Jenner.

Like others who are way past tired of the self-promoting Kardashians, a famous-for-being-famous clan of which Caitlyn is a part, I tried to ignore her latest burst of glamorized controversy.

But now I wonder: Will Caitlyn Jenner's fame do for the gender rights cause what, for example, Rock Hudson's and Magic Johnson's revelations of their HIV infections did for the fight against AIDS?

A lot already has changed. The trans-rights movement, not to be confused with the gay and lesbian rights movement, is growing in power and appeal. Time headlined its cover featuring actress and former man Laverne Cox last year with the headline ""The Transgender Tipping Point"" -- without a question mark.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, now a presidential hopeful from South Carolina, seemed to get that message when he invited Jenner, a reputed Republican, to vote for him as he pitched for a more inclusive GOP.

Still trans people endure enough discrimination to look like the final frontier in the civil rights revolution. In most states, it is still legal to fire someone for being transgender. Surveys by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force still find huge levels of violence and persecution against transgender people -- including 41 per cent of respondents who said that they had attempted suicide.

And as writer Michelle Goldberg reported last year in a The New Yorker piece titled ""What Is A Woman?"" transgender folks also are attacked by radical feminists on the left as being either inauthentic women, in the cases like Jenner's, or sellout women, in the cases of trans-men, who allegedly caved in to male supremacy.

Can't we all get along? Jenner has added fuel to that radical feminist backlash by announcing that she is leaving her male genitalia intact. A large number of trans-women do, surveys show. That's their right, but it doesn't make my pronoun problem any easier.",10/06/2015
NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics to sell rapid HIV tests in Europe,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. plans to sell another of its rapid tests for HIV in Europe, beginning in the fall.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests for HIV, syphilis and other diseases said this week that European regulators had granted a CE mark to its DPP HIV 1/2 Assay test.

The CE mark clears the way ""for commercialization and sale"" of the test in the 28 countries that are members of the European Union, executives said.

A CE mark means a product complies with industry and safety standards in Europe and therefore can be sold across national borders within the region.

The DPP test uses blood and saliva samples and is administered by a health care professional. It is already available in the United States and in Central and South America, including Mexico and Brazil, chief executive John J. Sperzel said Thursday.

Recent studies have shown one third of infected Europeans are unaware of their HIV status and as many as 50 percent of those infected with HIV are diagnosed late, after symptoms have emerged.

""Early diagnosis of HIV provides a significant advantage to patients,"" Sperzel said. ""It's been well documented that people who are diagnosed early and who receive early treatment can expect nearly the same life expectancy as those who are HIV-negative.""

In April, Chembio announced that a CE mark had been granted for private-label versions of its HIV self-test called Sure Check.

NewsDay,New rules on blood donation,"In 1983, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration instituted a blood-donating ban for any man who had had sex with another man since 1977.

After years of debate, the FDA finally proposed easing the rules to allow donations from men who have not had sex with another man for at least a year. As a gay man and public health professor specializing in HIV/AIDS prevention, I am disheartened by the FDA's suggested modification on the 32-year ban.

Even in its latest iteration -- the FDA proposed the change last month -- the rule still has stigma and discrimination written all over it.

For 12 years, I have dedicated my career to working with vulnerable and at-risk communities on safe-sex behaviors and sex-positive messaging, researching ways to expand rapid HIV testing into less traditional settings such as the dentist's office and local pharmacy, and preparing the future public health workforce to use evidence-based methods and tools when working with marginalized and medically underserved communities. Although I understand our government's early response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, times have changed. Now, in the United States, a gay man living with HIV who takes his medication regularly can enjoy a life expectancy of 77 years, about the same for an HIV-negative man.

A fundamental principle we teach students is that public health should achieve community health in a way that respects the rights of individuals in the community. Does the FDA value the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community it serves? The short answer is when it is convenient to do so. Why is it acceptable for heterosexual men or women to have sex with sex workers and other high-risk populations like intravenous drug users and still potentially donate blood, but any man who has had sex with another man cannot? Many members of the community, including myself, are left trying to make sense of policies that are conflicting and difficult to enforce.

HIV is no longer a ""gay disease."" People with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy enjoy long, healthy lives. Effective prevention strategies include biomedical advances such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (better known as PrEP), a daily pill to prevent HIV infection in high-risk behaviors. Sensitive and specific diagnostics are available to detect acute HIV infection. Additionally, all donated blood is tested numerous times for HIV and hepatitis B and C. This policy needs to fit the reality of the world we now live in.

I recommend that everyone, regardless of gender or sexual identity, be allowed to donate blood. Long Island, as well as most parts of the country, is experiencing shortages of donated blood. The New York Blood Center requires more than 2,000 volunteer blood donations each day to meet the transfusion needs of patients in close to 200 New York and New Jersey hospitals. If all blood undergoes testing for transmissible diseases, why discriminate against some populations?

I applaud the FDA for initiating the process to revise this archaic policy, but would remind the agency that its own parent organization, the DHHS, states that it works ""to improve the health and well-being of all Americans, including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.""

My message to the DHHS and FDA: It's is time to make good on your commitment.

My message to the gay community: We have until July 14 to have our voices heard through the FDA's public comment period. Now is the time to raise your voice!

NewsDay,Don't grow immune to the value of vaccines,"The fight against rubella, the deadly German measles, has finally paid off. Global health authorities say the terrible disease has been eliminated in the Americas. It's a rare dose of good news in the fight against the debilitating disease, which can cause birth defects or even fetal death if contracted by a pregnant woman.

The eradication was possible by one of modern medicine's most indispensable tools -- routine vaccination.

The value of immunization has never been more apparent. Yet Americans have grown skeptical of vaccines -- as well as the science behind them. That has to change. Few medical innovations have saved more lives than vaccines. And they may play an even larger role in the years to come.

It wasn't long ago that rubella posed a fearsome threat to unborn children. A U.S. outbreak in 1964-65 led to 11,000 miscarriages, abortions, and deaths in the womb. Another 20,000 children suffered birth defects.

The first vaccines for rubella became available in 1969. Of course, the victory over rubella is only the latest success story for vaccines. As recently as the 1950s, polio posed a serious threat to American children. A 1952 outbreak of the disease infected almost 60,000 children and killed more than 3,000. The disease paralyzed thousands more.

Vaccines' past and future beneficiaries may not realize that an important component of vaccine development is animal research. Animal research is responsible for some of the most beneficial vaccines in modern history -- including those for rubella, measles, and polio. And it's our best hope for finding a way to eradicate other destructive illnesses in the years to come.

Primate studies, for instance, provide unique insight into the immune system. Testing experimental medications and vaccines on animals is also a dependable -- and FDA required -- way to determine whether a new vaccine is safe for human use.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The rubella virus used in current measles-mumps-rubella vaccines was initially developed using animal cell cultures and chicken embryos. Later, the vaccine was proved safe and effective through tests on a variety of species, including primates, mice and rabbits.

Animals have benefited from this research as well. It's been essential to the creation of vaccines for animal diseases like rabies, cowpox, West Nile virus, and anthrax.

Today's vaccine research is no less dependent on primate experiments. Scientists are researching advanced vaccines for preventing HIV/AIDS, protecting humans against bioterrorism, and treating devastating diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.

In recent years, however, vaccines have been victims of their own success. With diseases like measles, polio, and now rubella mostly wiped out, some folks have forgotten how deadly those diseases used to be. Without a clear memory of the potential consequences of foregoing immunity, vaccination has become less pressing for many people.

Today, as many as 40 percent of parents choose to delay or refuse vaccinations for their children, with little understanding of the public health risks involved in such a decision. Many justify their choice with appeals to so-called ""herd immunity"" -- the idea that if enough people are vaccinated, a disease won't spread as easily. They can free-ride on the fact that most other people have received their shots.

But herd immunity only applies if a sufficient number of members of the herd get vaccinated. Eliminated diseases can quickly re-emerge when vaccination rates decline.

Less than 50 years ago, expectant parents lived in fear that rubella could harm -- or kill -- their unborn children. Animal research gave us the tools, in the form of vaccines, to eradicate rubella, measles, and other deadly diseases. We must remember to use them.

NewsDay,Sea Cliff company secures marijuana production facility,"A Sea Cliff company competing to win a New York State medical marijuana license and open a dispensary on Long Island Friday announced it has secured a manufacturing facility upstate.

PalliaTech Inc. said it has agreed to lease a 65,000- square-foot facility, part of a former Pfizer Inc. research and manufacturing center near New York's border with Canada, to grow and refine cannabis plants into medicinal form.

Financial terms of PalliaTech's lease were not disclosed. The deal, which gives the company the option to lease an additional 85,000 square feet at the site north of Plattsburgh in Clinton County, is contingent on PalliaTech's winning a medical marijuana license from the state Health Department.

Richard Taney, PalliaTech's president and chief executive, said the ""turnkey pharmaceutical R&D facility that can be brought online very quickly"" would help New Yorkers who suffer from illnesses that can be treated with medical cannabis.

The New York State Department of Health extended the deadline to apply for the five licenses from May 29 to June 5 after receiving a blizzard of inquiries.

The former Pfizer facility in Chazy, N.Y., was acquired in 2013 by Stephen and Victor Podd of NorthStar Private Capital LLC. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer pulled out of the 386,060-square-foot facility after announcing a restructuring in 2009. PalliaTech said as many as 60 people would be employed at the facility.

NewsDay,"Executive Suite: Gil Bernardino, Circulo de La Hispanidad","Before Gil Bernardino founded Circulo de la Hispanidad 35 years ago, he was a teacher who noticed Spanish-speaking students often did not make it to high school graduation.

""It was like everybody that I met was a dropout,"" said Bernardino, 67, who had come from Spain in 1974 and taught in Long Beach and Brooklyn. He said he saw the way proper educational support could improve a child's life and community, especially when the students were learning English as a second language. He left his teaching career and pension behind and launched the social service organization with $65,000 in grant money.

Now Circulo offers 20 programs open to all who need them, ranging from classes in computer skills to domestic violence and HIV/AIDS advocacy, at locations in Long Beach and Hempstead.

In 2008, Bernardino co-founded the Evergreen Charter School in Hempstead, which now has 300 students and a waiting list. Language arts test scores at the school have outperformed Hempstead public schools.

In 2010, Circulo built a community center that is LEED gold certified (a green building rating). Why the emphasis on environmentally friendly construction?

We breathe better inside the building than outside. Nothing inside or in the construction is damaging, not the glues or the materials. They gave us the gold medal. My thinking is that we are destroying our own planet. I wanted to live in a community that would inspire our people, our professionals, our children.

Why was it important to you to offer HIV/AIDS services?

Many years ago, I had a family member who passed away in New York City. Then I realized AIDS was not only in New York City but also in Long Beach and also affecting the Hispanic community.

Why do you believe education is so important?

Education and training is the key for permanent employment, and the best support that we can give to our community as far as future economic development.

What's the key to getting school graduation rates to rise?

You need to have much more personnel, more staff members to support the children in the school system . . . Many come from illiterate households. The immigrant population is in their survival stage, they work odd hours, 15 hours, in many cases for $7 an hour . . . When the spring comes many of our students leave us because they are working in gardens. And why not have Spanish [-speaking] teachers teaching other subjects? Our children need to see the same kind of role model that other students have.

Why does Evergreen Charter feed students breakfast and lunch?

There are a large percentage of [Latinos] with obesity and diabetes. Because [fast food] places are cheap, our communities eat a lot of this kind of food that really destroys their lives. If a child eats this kind of food in the morning, after an hour and a half in the classroom, their concentration is gone because the brain needs more than sugar.

What's something else you do to support students, especially those for whom English is a second language?

We have hired a lot of teachers to support those children and we have classes on Saturdays. We open our school on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon.

What happens when Spanish-speaking students are placed in English-speaking classrooms without support?

It is the philosophy that you put the baby in the swimming pool and maybe he'll come out alive or maybe not, with no plans. It's not good for the country, for the state, for the region when you have so many dropouts, such a high percentage of students really not coming out of high school prepared. This is not a question about [Hispanics] or African-Americans or the white poor, it's a question of how do we want to see our region's economic development.

NewsDay,State extends deadline to apply for medical marijuana licenses,"The New York State Department of Health is extending the deadline for applications for the five licenses to dispense medical marijuana after receiving a crush of inquiries about the program, according to the agency's website.

The original May 29 deadline has been pushed back to June 5, although the agency said it still plans to roll out the program as early as Jan. 5, 2016, 18 months after the medical marijuana law was signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

Richard Taney, chief executive of PalliaTech Inc., a Sea Cliff-based medical marijuana company that is readying an application that is expected to run more than 1,000 pages, said the state agency ""wanted to be responsive"" to the many questions related to the process.

The Health Department declined to provide additional details until it names the organizations that will dispense the drug. The state plans to award the five licenses 30 to 60 days after the deadline; each licensee would be authorized to run up to four dispensaries. Organizations not awarded a license would get their $200,000 registration fee back, but the $10,000 application fee is nonrefundable.

Several organizations have said they plan to apply for a license and set up dispensaries on Long Island.

Cuomo signed the Compassionate Care Act in July 2014, making New York the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana. Patients with conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease and Huntington's disease would be eligible to purchase marijuana.

The law bars administering smokable marijuana. Approved forms include liquid or oil for vaporization, or liquid, oil or capsules for oral dosages.

Taney said 6-year-old PalliaTech will file its application in a ""very, very competitive"" field for the five New York licenses. The company also is expecting state regulators to approve within days the opening of its dispensary in the southern New Jersey borough of Bellmawr, he said.

NewsDay,"Using 'Berlin Patient,' symposium at Columbia University to talk about cure for HIV","For years he was known only as the ""Berlin Patient,"" and naysayers refused to believe Timothy Ray Brown was cured of HIV and acute myeloid leukemia with a single bone-marrow transplant.

But not only have tests conducted by the National Institutes of Health proved that Brown is HIV- and cancer-free; an effort gets underway Saturday in Manhattan to broach the possibility of a cure for others with HIV/AIDS.

The Research Foundation to Cure AIDS, based in Manhattan, is sponsoring a two-hour symposium at 3 p.m. in Columbia University's Low Library. The event, open to the public, features two panels of speakers, including the Berlin Patient, Brown.

Cell biologist Kambiz Shekdar, the foundation's director, is calling the symposium the first step toward what he hopes will become a ""Manhattan Project"" aimed at finally defeating HIV worldwide.

""Eight years ago this person was cured and hardly anyone knew about it,"" Shekdar said Friday. ""At first people didn't want to believe it was possible, but now his case has withstood the test of time. And I think it's time that we start thinking about the possibility of a cure for others.""

Brown, 49, told Newsday he was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1995 and went on antiretroviral therapy, the standard cocktail of treatments designed to hold the infection in check. While not a cure, the therapy is lifelong.

Things changed dramatically for Brown in 2007, when he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia while in Berlin. AML is an extremely serious form of leukemia marked by high mortality.

AML is a disease of the myeloid cell line, which emerges in the bone marrow but morphs into numerous immune system components, including T and B cells, key infection-fighting soldiers. HIV targets T cells.

Brown was evaluated by Dr. Gero Huetter, of Charité Hospital in Berlin, who recommended bone-marrow transplantation and sought a donor with a specific mutation -- delta-32 -- on a T-cell protein dubbed CCR5.

Shekdar said the mutation is seen in a subset of people of Northern European heritage. The mutation, some scientists posit, was passed generation to generation after the Black Plague. Descendants of survivors carry the delta-32 miscue in their genome and numerous studies have demonstrated the cells rebuff HIV.

Huetter wrote in a 2009 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that he and his team theorized it was possible to correct both diseases in one blow.

Dr. Ruthee-Lu Bayer, a hematologist at North Shore-LIJ's Monter Cancer Center in Lake Success, said Huetter apparently was right.

""In a bone-marrow transplant, we want to grow the bone marrow of the donor in the patient,"" she said Friday. ""And the donor's bone marrow will take over the production of the patient's blood cells, and ultimately, the donor's marrow will take over the patient's immune system.""

Bayer said bone marrow contains stem cells, the seeds for various populations of cells in the blood.

Shekdar, meanwhile, said he's not proposing bone-marrow transplants, but a therapy in which a patient's own cells are withdrawn and primed in the lab with those bearing the delta-32 quirk, then infused back into the patient. The principle is similar to the world's first cancer vaccine -- Proscar -- for prostate malignancies.

Brown, who doesn't mind being called the Berlin Patient, now lives in California. He said there initially was disbelief that he was cured. But skepticism didn't trump science: ""It has been confirmed by many doctors in Germany and in this country,"" Brown said.",08/05/2015
NewsDay,"Chembio Diagnostics loss widens on higher research, marketing costs","Chembio Diagnostics Inc. on Thursday reported a wider loss for the January to March period than in the same period in 2014.

The Medford-based manufacturer of rapid tests for HIV, syphilis and other diseases reported a loss of $647,000 for the quarter. That's more than double the 2014 loss of $225,000.

John J. Sperzel, the company's chief executive, blamed the wider loss on larger expenses for research and marketing.

Chembio reported sales of $6 million for January to March, a 7-percent gain from 2014.

Sperzel said the company is poised for growth, in part because it will regain full control of the marketing of its tests by the summer of 2016.

NewsDay,Inviting co-workers to weddings is risky business,"DEAR AMY: I am wondering if you have some advice for me regarding a co-worker and my upcoming wedding. She and I worked together for a year and now work in the same place but in different grade levels. There was a time last year when this co-worker's spouse berated me via email and phone call when the co-worker's child received points off on an assignment (we work in a school). Other situations here and there occurred over the year, but we ended the year civilly. The co-worker and I have an OK relationship at work. Later on this year I will be getting married. The news spread fast and the co-worker has made hints about being at the wedding. It also came up that the co-worker had unfriended me on a social media site and then ""refriended"" me after finding out that I was inviting some of my other co-workers. I know that seems kind of silly but it still bothered me. My fiance stated that it's no big deal if we invite this person. He says let's just celebrate our big day. The spouse would be included on the invitation, which makes me kind of cringe. I don't know what to do. I don't want to upset the co-worker and strain the relationship. It's also hard because other team members will be in attendance. Should I include this co-worker? Am I making a mountain out of a mole hill?

Torn

DEAR TORN: First of all, there are no ""rules"" for whom you must invite to your wedding. The idea is that this incredibly special day should be reserved only for those nearest and dearest.

However -- and this is a big however -- weddings don't always work that way. You end up being pressured into inviting your dad's bowling buddies or your Aunt Sue's second husband's youngest daughter's boyfriend.

If you think NOT including this co-worker would cause personal problems, work problems, tension or guilt for you after the fact, and if you can afford to host her and her spouse -- in the name of ""rising above it,"" you should invite them. However, if you visualize yourself at your wedding and the thought of seeing her and her spouse there gives you hives, definitely do not. If it were me, I would not invite her -- and prepare myself for some blowback.

This sort of scenario is made much worse by Facebook. Be judicious and discreet in your postings.

DEAR AMY: I pointedly did NOT invite a co-worker to my wedding, but she showed up anyway. She came as a guest of another co-worker she conned into taking her. Since the invitations were mailed to the invitees and ""guest,"" she persuaded the co-worker to take her along. She showed up and flaunted the fact that she was able to thwart our attempts not to invite her, drank too much and was out of control. The co-worker who brought her was asked to take her home, but outside of a police escort, this was not going to happen. Needless to say, I found another job and quit. My message is don't invite any co-workers, unless they are part of the wedding. Oh, and hire a bouncer.

Still Have Flashbacks

DEAR FLASHBACKS: I hope the marriage is more peaceful than your wedding.

DEAR AMY: I have to take issue with your response to ""Confused,"" the letter writer who received a thank-you note for the wrong wedding gift and felt compelled to correct the error. In my opinion, this reeks of materialism and unnecessary self-aggrandizement. Why embarrass a new bride over such pettiness? The fact that a nice thank-you note was sent should have been sufficient, both in terms of etiquette and satisfaction that the attendee's gift was received and appreciated.

Thank-you Note is Enough

DEAR ENOUGH: I agree that the marrying couple has done (almost) everything right. But the reason to discreetly correct someone is because not only one note was incorrect -- at least two ""thank yous"" (and possibly more) went to the wrong recipients.

After this simple ""heads-up,"" no other action is necessary -- the couple should not be expected to write and send another note.",01/05/2015

NewsDay,"Way to Go: Matthew Hartmann, Levittown","A Levittown student is using his birthday as an opportunity to give gifts to others.

Matthew Hartmann, a second-grader at Abbey Lane Elementary School, raised $1,125 by asking friends and family to donate money in lieu of gifts to benefit the Richard M.

The foundation raises funds and awareness to find a cure for AIDS and to benefit those living with HIV/AIDS. It also supports people who have brain cancer and raises awareness about orphans in sub-Saharan Africa who need vaccinations, clean drinking water and clothing.

""I'm surprised I was able to raise so much,"" said Matthew, who turned 8 last month. ""I'm happy I decided to do it.""

NewsDay,Controversy over new medical marijuana rules,"ALBANY -- Some state legislators and patient advocates said Wednesday that new state regulations to dispense medical marijuana beginning in January are too restrictive and will keep sufferers from the full benefit of the therapy.

But the state Health Department said the regulations, released Tuesday, ""strike the required balance"" between serving patients and avoiding black-market marijuana sales.

The Compassionate Care Act, passed last year, will make marijuana available to people with specific illnesses including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal injuries, cancer and HIV/AIDS.

During an extensive public comment period about the regulations, patient advocates and supporters of legalizing marijuana had sought to make the drug available to more people.

Assembly Health Committee chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) said the regulations implementing the law ""would deprive seriously ill patients of relief. One might wonder if the regulations were designed to prevent the system from operating at all.""

But Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island) urged patience as the state tries to create a new industry within the 18 months required by the law she sponsored.

""I would like people to keep in mind that when you look at states that have adopted medical marijuana, the average wait time from legislation passing to the first sale is 25 months,"" she said.

Savino said she wants the program to serve more people, but the department's responses to the public comments indicate that will be considered as demand grows.

In New York, laws are drafted by legislators, but rules on how to implement them are written by members of the governor's administration. After a public comment period, the rules can be adjusted based on new or compelling information, but still must reflect the intent of the laws.

The regulations released Tuesday prohibit sale of medical marijuana that can be smoked, allowing only forms that can be eaten or used in vapor. The drug must be prescribed by physicians and will be provided through only five organizations. It may only be dispensed by pharmacists at 20 sites statewide and whole plants can't be possessed.

In response to public comment, the department also emphasized the law's prohibition against consuming or providing food, drink or admitting ""visitors"" to sites where medical marijuana is dispensed. The regulations also prohibit consuming medical marijuana ""in a public place.""

Some patient advocates called the regulations ""unworkable"" and said thousands of patients will suffer needlessly because of them.

Gabriel Sayegh of the Drug Policy Alliance, one of several advocates for medical marijuana, called it ""baffling and downright unacceptable"" for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to ""ignore both the science on medical marijuana and the evidence on medical marijuana programs."" Sayegh said Cuomo ""is abandoning patients and families in need in pursuit of a war on drugs approach.""

The advocates said they will return to lobby the legislature to make medical marijuana more accessible.

Cuomo long had rejected legalization of medical marijuana, saying he didn't want to create an easy way to legally possess and abuse a drug that is illegal under federal and state law.

The health department said it would consider some of the comments in drawing up future regulations. Officials said they may add nurse practitioners as legal prescribers and authorize more providers in coming years.",01/04/2015
NewsDay,NY issues details on how to dispense medical marijuana,"ALBANY - Some patient advocates said Wednesday that New York’s new regulations to dispense medical marijuana beginning in January are too restrictive and will keep sufferers from the full benefit of the therapy.

NewsDay,"Port Washington man sentenced to 3 years in prison in prescription drug fraud scheme, Feds say","A Port Washington man who ran a scheme to defraud government health programs out of millions of dollars by selling secondhand prescription drugs as ""factory fresh"" has been sentenced to 3 years in prison and ordered to pay more than $7 million in restitution, federal prosecutors said.

Purna Chandra Aramalla was sentenced Friday for conducting a scheme to defraud Medicaid, Medicare and the state-funded AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), according to a news release from the office of Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

Aramalla also was sentenced for tax evasion by U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty.

Aramalla, 67, a pharmacist who owned two New York City pharmacies, purchased prescription drugs, including high-cost medications used to treat HIV, that were obtained from patients who sold the drugs rather than use them to treat their illnesses, officials said.

He then repackaged and resold those prescription drugs to his customers, as if they were new drugs obtained from legitimate sources. Aramalla requested and received reimbursement from Medicaid, Medicare, and ADAP in connection with these sales, even though these programs would not have been willing to reimburse the cost of secondhand drugs, prosecutors said.

Aramalla operated A Fair Deal Pharmacy Inc. in Queens and Quality Drug Inc. in the Bronx, prosecutors said.

In addition, in some cases, these programs had already paid for the prescription drugs when they were initially dispensed. In order to make the diverted drugs appear to be new drugs from legitimate sources, Aramalla and his co-conspirators used lighter fluid and other means to dissolve the adhesive on the patient labels on prescription bottles so that they could be removed and replaced with new labels, prosecutors said.

Aramalla also sought and obtained reimbursement for prescription drugs that were never actually dispensed to patients. Instead, customers with prescriptions for drugs essentially ""sold"" their prescriptions to Aramalla, agreeing not to take delivery of the drugs in exchange for a share of the reimbursed proceeds, according to prosecutors.

NewsDay,Letter: Pessimistic about Alzheimer's news,"Newsday's editorial ""Alzheimer's researchers and their hopeful news"" [March 23] is incredibly naïve.

The editorial reports on recent studies showing promising results on mice or with small human populations that could lead to a future with fewer people living with and dying from Alzheimer's. I, too, wish for that future.

However, the sad reality is that promising results with mice or even with small human populations have been reported many times before without being successfully duplicated in larger clinical trials. Let's wait to see if positive results can be duplicated with at least 1,000 participants before getting too excited about the latest Alzheimer's treatment being tested.

The editorial also cited the formation of a new $100-million global fund for Alzheimer's research as a positive sign. That may sound like a serious investment to help end Alzheimer's, but when compared with President Barack Obama's most recent budget request for more than $8 billion for combined domestic and global HIV research, $100 million is the proverbial drop in the bucket.

The National Institutes of Health each year allocates six times more money for research on HIV/AIDS, a disease that can already be prevented and treated, than it does for Alzheimer's, which has no means of prevention or effective treatment.

An estimated 700,000 Americans will die from Alzheimer's this year, compared with about 15,000 dying from HIV/AIDS. Newsday should be calling upon our federal government to reorder its funding priorities.

NewsDay,'It Follows' review: Scares that work,"The trouble starts in ""It Follows"" as it does in many horror films -- with sex. Jay, a pretty and somewhat thoughtful college student played by Maika Monroe, is on a date with Hugh (Jake Weary), a scruffy charmer. A few beers precede a smooch, which leads to the back of Hugh's car.

This is where Jason, Freddy or Michael Myers usually show up to slaughter our young lovers. His ostensible reasons vary -- psychosis, occultism, misplaced anger -- but we know deep down that he is punishing the promiscuous. The slasher is a metaphor for The Consequences.

""It Follows"" has a different metaphor, at once more vague and more chillingly explicit. ""This thing, it's gonna follow you,"" Hugh confesses before Jay can even re-dress. ""Somebody gave it to me, and I passed it to you."" Yes, Jay could give it to someone else -- but if that partner dies, ""it"" will come right back to Jay.

That's a nifty, near-brilliant idea from second-time filmmaker David Robert Mitchell (""The Myth of the American Sleepover""). A low-budget, youth-oriented horror movie, ""It Follows"" takes the sexual anxieties of a generation -- AIDS and HIV, obviously, but also issues of power, exploitation and shame -- and transforms them into a creepy bogeyman.

As Jay is increasingly haunted by zombielike specters who resemble friends and loved ones, she must grapple with moral questions: Should she pass ""it"" on to lovestruck Paul (Kier Gilchrist), who would willingly die for her? Or might the neighborhood ladies' man, Greg (Daniel Zovatto), be a better choice?

Mitchell, inspired by indie-horror auteurs like George Romero, John Carpenter and Wes Craven, makes maximum use of his limited budget. Torn clothes and a little eye-black create some ghastly ghouls. The synth-driven score, by the band Disasterpiece, lends a sinister ambience. The suburban streets and decaying inner city of the Detroit area (playing itself) are evocatively filmed.

""It Follows"" promises more than it delivers. The climax, an elaborate plan to trap and kill ""it,"" loses sight of the film's heady concept and resorts to genre cliches. Still, ""It Follows"" is so moody, atmospheric and often riveting that it's worth sharing with others.",26/03/2015
NewsDay,Stellenbosch University performs first successful penis tranplant surgery,"Surgeons from Stellenbosch University and Cape Town’s Tygerberg Hospital have performed the world’s first successful penis transplant.

The nine-hour operation was performed Dec. 11 on the 21- year-old recipient, who made a full recovery and regained all functions in the transplanted organ, the South African university said in a statement Friday.

The patient, whose identity wasn’t disclosed, had his penis amputated three years ago in order to save his life when he developed complications after a traditional circumcision. There are an estimated 250 penile amputations each year in South Africa stemming from circumcisions, the university said.

“Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery,” said Andre van der Merwe, head of the university’s Division of Urology, who led the team during the operation.

It is the second time this type of operation was attempted and the first time that a successful long-term result was achieved, the university said.

“There is a greater need in South Africa for this type of procedure than elsewhere in the world, as many young men lose their penises every year due to complications from traditional circumcision,” said Van der Merwe.

“It helps a community of men,” Van der Merwe said in a phone interview. “These men have lost their penises in traditional circumcision. Nobody talks about them, they’re ostracized, they’re stigmatized and this is good news for them.”

Clinical Trial

South Africa is also home to the first heart transplant, which took place in 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town.

The patient who received the penile transplant is sexually active and will be able to have children if he chooses, Van der Merwe said. Doctors will monitor him for another three months before they operate on any of nine other men awaiting a penile transplant as part of a clinical trial Van der Merwe and his team started in 2010.

The first transplant took so long, in part, because families didn’t want to donate their relatives’ penises, he said.

“In South Africa, the law is even if you are an organ donor, you’re not allowed to harvest any organs from that patient unless the family consents,” he said in the interview.

Organ Donors

Van der Merwe and his team were able to convince a family after deciding they could make a penis-like appendage on the corpse using a leftover skin flap.

“The family is much happier to send the body to the grave with something resembling a penis,” he said.

The transplanted penis wasn’t circumcised and it will be at least several months before the patient can return for the medical procedure since he’s now taking immunosuppressant drugs necessary to prevent rejection of the new body part.

Traditional male circumcision is a cultural initiation rite practiced by certain ethnic groups in South Africa, including the Xhosa and Ndebele. They often aren’t done in sterile environments and complications can occur including infection, gangrene

and genital mutilation.

In the Eastern Cape Province, where the practice is common, there were 9 amputations of the penis and 43 deaths in 2013, according to a provincial department of health report.

Circumcision at birth isn’t a normal practice in South Africa, said Beth Skorochod, deputy director of HIV/TB at PSI, a global health organization based in Washington.

The rite of passage involved in traditional circumcision is different from a push the last several years by groups like PSI to get men, typically those 25 and older, to undergo the surgery in a medical setting as an HIV prevention method.

Circumcision reduces a man’s risk of contracting HIV by 60 percent, Skorochod said in an interview.

NewsDay,Chembio hopes for speedy trial of rapid Ebola test,"A Medford company hopes to begin a trial of its rapid test for Ebola by March 31 in West Africa, the epicenter of the deadly disease, officials said.

Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has applied for permission from the World Health Organization after successfully testing its point-of-care technology in a federal laboratory in Atlanta.

Chembio also said it had signed a research agreement with the lab's operator, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The local company already makes rapid tests for HIV and syphilis.

Chembio began work on the Ebola test in October after partnering with Integrated BioTherapeutics Inc., a Maryland-based biotechnology company that possesses Ebola antibodies.

John J. Sperzel, chief executive of Chembio, said this week that the partnership had shortened development time of the Ebola test.

A rapid test could allow for quicker diagnosis. The tests can be performed at doctors' offices, clinics and in rural villages. Currently, samples must be taken from patients and transported to a hospital or laboratory in a city for testing.

Test results would be known in minutes, not hours or days. And patients wouldn't have to travel far to be diagnosed, Sperzel said.

Ebola, in its latest outbreak, has claimed 8,429 lives in West Africa, though the number of new cases has declined, according to the WHO. There have been two deaths in the United States so far, according to reports.

NewsDay,Should FDA lift ban on gay men donating blood?,"A controversial lifetime ban on blood donations by men who have had sex with other men could be headed for a change.

The Food and Drug Administration has recently proposed changing the long-standing policy to only prohibit blood donations from men who have had homosexual activity within the past year. The original policy banned all male blood donors who say they’ve had sex with another man anytime since 1977.

The topic has generated a lot of heated discussion — including a recent Newsday editorial — with some even saying the newly proposed change doesn't go far enough.

And while everyone seems to have an opinion, not everyone seems to have the facts.

In the early 1980s, AIDS swept through the country, killing thousands. The cause initially was unknown but being gay was a significant risk factor. Receiving a blood transfusion was another risk factor. To help protect the blood supply, anyone who had engaged in homosexual activity as far back as 1977 was prohibited from being a blood donor.

We now know AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. The CDC estimates there are more than 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States. About 50,000 people get infected with HIV annually, with 4,175 new cases diagnosed in New York in 2012, the center reports. Even today, men who have had sex with other men are the most severely affected by the virus in the United States.

But despite the fact that HIV has persisted, the blood supply has also become much safer. Potential blood donors are initially screened with a questionnaire, and are not allowed to donate if their answers indicate they are at high risk for having HIV.

Blood that is donated is also screened for HIV, in addition to other diseases. Note the blood is checked for HIV, not for AIDS. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is the clinical problem that develops years, or decades, after becoming infected with HIV; a patient's immune system becomes so weakened that they become very vulnerable to many different infections (the terms are not interchangeable).

So doesn’t being able to check for HIV guarantee the blood is safe?

No.

The problem is it takes time for an infected person to have enough of the virus in their blood for the test to be able to detect it. This time period is known as the “window.” Even with the most sophisticated — and expensive — test available, there is still a window of about 10 days. In other words, if someone becomes infected with HIV today and donates blood anytime in the next 10 days or so, their blood will test negative for HIV and can be used for transfusions, most likely infecting the recipient.

This is extremely rare but it does happen; the best estimate is that HIV is transmitted once in every one or two million transfusions.

Many men who have sex with men object to a policy that limits their ability to donate blood. Their arguments include: it is discriminatory to ban them as a group; a man in a monogamous relationship with an HIV negative man is not at increased risk; and the questionnaire does not ask females if they are engaging in unprotected heterosexual intercourse, which is the number one HIV risk factor for females.

The proposed change tries to address these arguments by easing the restriction, but it essentially continues to ban all men who actively have sex with other men from being donors.

Organizations such as the American Medical Association agree the current policy is outdated, calling it “discriminatory and not based on sound science.”

FDA officials say that while advances in science allow for easing the restriction, “we simply don’t have the evidence” needed to lift the restrictions entirely.

The FDA argues that having sex with another man still remains, by far, the number one risk factor for HIV. And more importantly, these men are much more likely to transmit HIV than those in other high risk categories. They also note that there are indeed other entire groups excluded from donating blood, such as people who have traveled to or lived in certain areas outside the country.

If a change to the ban is enacted, the United States will be following in the footsteps of other countries, such as Australia, Japan and Sweden, that have a one-year deferral period. Italy and Spain have an even less restrictive approach. In these countries, potential donors are screened for high-risk sexual practices and deferred on a case-by-case basis. A 2013 study that looked at the change in Italy found no evidence that the new policy impacted the HIV epidemic in that country.

Is the FDA still being unfair to men who have sex with other men? Are they taking a risk by easing the restriction? In 2015, the FDA will post a draft of proposed changes to the blood donor deferral policy for men who have sex with men that will include a period for public comment. And while there are legitimate grounds for disagreement on this issue, the debate should be based on facts, not emotions.",07/01/2015
NewsDay,Chembio to work on test for traumatic brain injury,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. will work on a rapid test for traumatic brain injury, including concussions from playing sports, executives said Tuesday.

The Medford-based manufacturer of point-of-care tests used to detect HIV and syphilis is partnering with the Concussion Science Group division of Perseus Science Group LLC in a study to diagnose brain injuries.

Perseus Science, based in Connecticut, will have its concussion unit make payments to Chembio this year. The concussion unit has patented a biomarker to identify brain injuries in humans.

John J. Sperzel, Chembio's chief executive, said he hopes the research ""will aid in early diagnosis, reduced costs and improved outcomes for patients.""

He also said more than 775,000 children are treated at hospitals each year for brain injuries due to playing sports. Concussion is the most common injury but often goes undiagnosed for a time.

Sperzel said a rapid test ""could lead to early intervention and reduced incidence of secondary injuries.""

The concussion research agreement follows those announced by Chembio last year for tests for the Ebola virus, dengue fever virus and an undisclosed type of cancer.

Chembio also widened distribution of one of its rapid HIV tests to clinics, community health care centers and more doctors' offices in this country because of a federal waiver last year. The company increased its U.S. sales team to six people as a result.

NewsDay,Progress in AIDS fight,"WASHINGTON -- On World AIDS Day yesterday, activists are celebrating what they see as a pretty major milestone in efforts to combat the deadly virus -- for the first time in the past year, the number of HIV patients who started receiving medication was greater than those newly infected with the virus, according to the ONE Campaign.

That marks a ""tipping point"" in global efforts to fight a disease that's killed about 40 million people worldwide since it was first reported a little more than 30 years ago, the campaign declared Monday morning. As a ""tipping point"" indicates, that also means more progress is still needed.

Though global funding for HIV/AIDS hit an all-time high of $19.1 billion in 2013, that's still at least $3 billion less than what UNAIDS says is needed each year to control the virus. And HIV is increasingly concentrated among harder-to-reach populations, including men who have sex with men, female sex workers, injection drug users and adolescent girls, according to the report.

Here in the United States, the progress fighting the virus has been mixed recently. The HIV diagnosis rate dropped about 33 percent over a decade, from 24.1 per 100,000 population in 2002 to 16.1 per 100,000 in 2011.

That's according to a recent analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found significant decreases in diagnosis rates for most demographics, with the largest seen among women, people ages 35-44 and people of multiple races. However, diagnoses attributable to male-to-male sexual contact saw increases for nearly every group, with those 13-24 years old recording the largest increase (133 percent) of any group.

Of the 1.2 million Americans who had HIV in 2011, just 40 percent said they were seeing a medical professional for the virus and 37 percent had a prescription, the CDC revealed last week. Just 30 percent of those infected had the virus under control.

The coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act that took effect this year will provide new opportunities for people with HIV to receive care. Before the ACA, the system of coverage for HIV patients was ""a complex patchwork that leaves some outside the system and presents others with barrier to needed access,"" according the Kaiser Family Foundation.

NewsDay,FDA should end ban on gay blood donations,"I’ve rarely been accused of being ahead of my time, but in September of 2013 I wrote a column about the lifetime ban on blood donations by gay men and the fact that it needs to end. Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration will kick off a two-day conference on whether the ban should be ended.

Conclusion: I am only ever going to be considered “ahead of my time” in comparison to the federal government, which moves with all the urgency of a 6-year-old headed to bed.

The lifetime ban on male gay donors is zero percent science and 100 percent homophobia. Every medical and scientific group agrees that letting these guys give blood presents essentially no risk.

And if it did present a risk, honestly, I’m not sure a questionnaire asking us whether we did stuff that could cause us to get AIDS would be much protection.

Regardless, I don’t think I can say it much better than I did 15 months ago, so here’s that column.

If you donate blood, you know the questionnaire is so mind-numbing that it's kind of hard to fill in properly. You start checking off boxes so fast that mistakes happen.

Nurse: ""So you are pregnant, take intravenous drugs and recently spent a year in Haiti?""

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Me: ""Did I check all the 'yes' boxes in the 'no' row again?""

Nurse: ""Actually, I'm more worried about you checking the 'mad cow disease' box.""

Me: ""Honestly, I think I just had like a touch of the 24-hour mad cow disease. It was more like 'resentful heifer sniffles.' ""

The questions are all on the honor system because the real safeguard of the blood supply isn't our willingness to be honest. After all, what happens in Quogue stays in Quogue. What safeguards the blood supply are the tests run on each donation.

And that's why the lifetime ban on donations by gay and bisexual men needs to end.

The American Medical Association voted to oppose the lifetime ban in June. And in August more than 80 members of Congress wrote to the Department of Health and Human Services decrying the policy.

That ban was imposed 30 years ago, and it made sense. Blood tests to find HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, were not as good as they are now: If such a ban had not been implemented then, faith in the blood supply would have plummeted.

Now, according to a Centers for Disease Control report, the chances of getting HIV through a transfusion are 1.5 million to 1. The only danger is the slight possibility that a donor would have contracted HIV so recently that the screening tests missed it.

Even 1.5 million to 1 is a chance we shouldn't take, and there's no reason we have to, even if we let gay men give.

The risk of having undetected HIV in your blood doesn't come from being a gay man, or even having had a gay ""just experimenting"" phase in college that, like your quest for a degree, lasted 11 years. It comes from having had such sex recently enough that the virus could sneak past a screening. That period is now just days.

And gay men aren't the only risk. About 28 percent of infections are caused by heterosexual sex, and a quarter of victims are women.

Based on that, it's as reasonable to ban a woman from donating if she's had unprotected sex with a man ""even once"" as it is to ban a man who's had sex with another man once.

The questionnaire is limited, and it has to be. If we eliminated every person who could possibly have contracted HIV, there wouldn't be anyone left. For instance, the sheet asks women if they've ever slept with a man who has slept with another man, but not if they've had unprotected sex with 188 guys who haven't slept with other men (or could be, gosh, lying about it). Since, as all children of the 1980s know, every time you sleep with a person, you're sleeping with every decision they ever made after seven Zimas, this is relevant.

The Food and Drug Administration says the lifetime ban will be eased ""only if supported by scientific data showing that a change in policy would not present a significant and preventable risk to blood recipients."" But again, that ban is not against donating. It's against donating if you're gay and don't check the ""I'm so not gay"" box. As far as I know, the NSA hasn't figured out a way to track these behaviors yet.

The Red Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks and America's Blood Centers have told the FDA the ban is medically and scientifically unwarranted. What isn't bigoted and might protect the blood supply more is to ask anyone, gay or straight, who's had unsafe sex over the past three months not to donate.

And just to be sure, anyone who's ever had more than three Zimas at a sitting, or 24 in their lifetime.

NewsDay,'Wild': A charged experience for Reese Witherspoon,"TELLURIDE, Colo. - 'Your movie, your movie, your movie!"" Laura Linney gushed to Reese Witherspoon, who was brunching at the homey and packed New Sheridan Hotel with her director, Jean-Marc Vallée, and co-star Laura Dern the morning after the first public screening in August of ""Wild"" at the Telluride Film Festival.

Half the world of international cinema seemed to be at the New Sheridan, too -- Mexican actor Gael García Bernal, Cannes Film Festival director Thierry Frémaux, Canadian filmmaking prodigy Xavier Dolan and Telluride co-director Julie Huntsinger also drifted over to the table to congratulate the trio, who were discussing the reception of ""Wild"" over omelets and iced tea.

""I think people don't know what to expect yet,"" Witherspoon said of the film's opening scene, a shot of her character flinging a hiking boot over a precipice, followed by several rapid cuts of sexual images. ""When you have that flash montage, it's really quick, but it's, like, 'Oh, wait, this isn't a white girl problems movie.'""

Performance praised

""Wild"" -- which opens Wednesday in Manhattan -- is an adaptation of Cheryl Strayed's bestselling memoir about her life-changing, 1,100-mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Oregon.

For actors and filmmakers, a festival premiere is an especially vulnerable moment, a time when critics, peers and audiences might laugh in the wrong places or cry in the right ones, or anoint a movie or demolish it.

(As it turned out, critics at Telluride embraced Witherspoon's performance, with Variety's Justin Chang saying the film's ""blend of grit, vulnerability, physical bravery and emotional immediacy"" easily represented the actress' ""most affecting and substantial work in the nine years since 'Walk the Line.'"")

The process of sharing ""Wild"" with audiences is a particularly charged one for Witherspoon, who is playing against the cheerful, girl-next-door persona she established in comedies such as ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"" in a role featuring hard drug use, casual sex and a character confronting a profound sense of loss. Witherspoon optioned ""Wild"" with her own money, produced its adaptation by novelist-screenwriter Nick Hornby and got so physically and emotionally naked for the role, she said, that she enlisted a hypnotist to overcome her anxiety.

Now she was letting that deeply personal project out into the world.

""Movies have all this potential in your mind,"" Witherspoon said in an interview. ""Then you make them and it could be anything. It could be the greatest movie ever made or ... you just don't know. It's kind of precious and sacred.""

Witherspoon, 38, plays Strayed on her journey to self-discovery, a trip undertaken with a giant pack full of hurt on her back after a divorce and the death of her mother, Bobbi. Dern plays Bobbi, an ethereal figure whom Strayed considers the love of her life.

At 47, Dern is near Witherspoon's age. Though much of the story unfolds in flashback, they do share many scenes as mother and daughter, with Witherspoon acting as a 20-something.

""After we did it, we went to dinner with a mutual girlfriend who's an actor, too,"" Dern said, adding that the friend asked whether, in age-conscious Hollywood, Dern was nervous about playing a character who was a generation older than Witherspoon. ""I was, like, 'Wait, wha?' It didn't give me pause before, but after, I felt maybe vulnerable that somebody else pointed it out.""

Shooting the movie took endurance and pluck: To get to the location of the boot-flinging shot, a mountain beside Oregon's 11,239-foot Mount Hood, cast and crew had to take two ski lifts and hike half an hour with their gear and a live fox, which appears in the scene. A camera crew was harnessed and suspended off the side of the mountain with belay ropes.

Weighty realism

A recurring motif in ""Wild"" is Strayed's massive, overstuffed backpack, nicknamed Monster by other hikers on the trail.

Concerned with realism, Vallée kept loading down the dainty, 5-foot-1 Witherspoon with weight.

But it was the emotional gravity of the story that both enticed and panicked Witherspoon. She had sought out Vallée as a director after seeing his raw 2013 drama ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" which earned Oscars for Matthew McConaughey as an HIV-

positive electrician and Jared Leto as a drug-addicted transgender woman.

""I didn't want this to just be a movie where a girl lost herself on a hike,"" Witherspoon said. ""Jean-Marc doesn't turn the camera away. We got to set and he said, 'Let's talk about the sexuality. I think we need to push it a little bit more,' and I was, like, 'Don't make me do it! Can't we make Laura do it?'""

One day on set, an extremely thin actor cast as a heroin addict passed out, and a replacement had to be recast in a matter of hours for a particularly intense scene.

""It was, like, 'Oh, hi, I'm Reese Witherspoon. Nice to meet you. I'm going to take off my clothes now -- here's my leg,'"" Witherspoon said. ""'You need to be totally naked, I need to be totally naked, and we're going to pretend to do drugs together. By the way, we're four hours behind. So let's go.'""

Except for establishing shots of the wilderness, Vallée said, the idea was to tell the story entirely through Strayed's eyes.

""Most of the film is told from her point of view. What she sees is what we see; what she hears is what we hear,"" Vallée said. ""The sex scenes were the same. It's not soft, poetic and sensual.""

Adds Witherspoon: ""It's just a unique thing to see it from a woman's perspective. I said to my producer, 'If we can pull this movie off, it'll be the first movie that ends with a woman with no man, no mother, no father, no job, no opportunity, and it's a happy ending. If we can end the movie and she's just OK, that's the greatest victory -- for a human being to realize I'm all alone in the world, and that's OK.'""",28/11/2014

NewsDay,"Audit finds $179,000 in 'questionable' spending by AIDS agency head","A state comptroller's audit has uncovered $179,000 in ""inappropriate or questionable"" spending by the head of a taxpayer-funded Long Island HIV and AIDS center who allegedly altered financial records to disguise personal expenses.

Gail Barouh, chief executive of the nonprofit Long Island Association for AIDS Care, used state funding for personal expenses including $4,400 for gasoline and $4,700 for ""seafood and meat"" and other miscellaneous purchases from a local grocery store, according to a 14-page report by State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.

The audit examined the group's contract with the state Health Department from July 2011 through July 2012.

In a statement, LIAAC officials said the audit identified ""some administrative and managerial deficiencies,"" and that the nonprofit had begun ""corrective action,"" including hiring an accounting firm with experience with nonprofits.

""With this issue behind us, LIAAC looks forward to continuing our mission of keeping Long Islanders healthy, educated and safe,"" agency spokesman Arthur Malkin said in a statement.

Bernard J. McHugh, director of state expenditures for the comptroller's office, wrote in the audit that a review of the organization's financial records found ""the CEO failed to demonstrate the expenses were business related or the evidence provided supports some of the expenses were personal.""

The report, released in September, says Barouh ""manipulated"" and ""redacted"" her monthly fuel credit card statements to omit transactions that showed she used the card for personal trips. Malkin did not respond to a request Monday to speak with Barouh.

The report noted that auditors had to request receipts and financial documents five times before they were provided.

""We subsequently obtained these statements directly from the fuel vendor and found out-of-state fuel card transactions on days that coincided with days the CEO took personal time,"" the report states.

The agency, which is based in Hauppauge, provides HIV testing and support groups for infected patients. It is under state contract, and the Health Department intends to recover the money in question, according to an Aug. 7 letter to DiNapoli's office from State Deputy Health Commissioner Sue Kelly.

Kelly also said the state office that handles oversight of HIV/AIDS agencies ""is in the process of updating many of its internal procedures and monitoring protocols.""

The report's findings have been forwarded to State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office, according to DiNapoli's office. Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Melissa Grace, said, ""We cannot comment on potential or ongoing investigations.""

In May 2011, Nassau County Comptroller George Maragos announced an audit of LIAAC but a year later referred the matter to DiNapoli and Schneiderman due to ""lack of cooperation from the agency"" in handing over financial records.",11/11/2014

NewsDay,Doctor's Diagnosis: Yeast infection,"A female patient is given an antibiotic for bronchitis. The bronchitis improves but she returns a short time later complaining of a vaginal discharge. Coincidence? Probably not.

Each of us has trillions of microbes living in us and on us. Usually these microbes are harmless, and indeed many are helpful. Most of these microbes are bacteria. Some are yeast cells, which are actually a one-celled fungus. These yeast cells usually do not cause any problems, unless something disrupts this microscopic world.

Antibiotics frequently are the cause of such a disruption. For example, if a patient with bronchitis is given an antibiotic, the antibiotic will hopefully kill the bacteria that are causing the bronchitis. However, it may also kill some of the bacteria that are keeping the yeast cells in check. Since antibiotics have no effect on yeast cells, the yeast cells are free to multiply uncontrollably, often leading to problems such as a vaginal yeast infection.

The resultant yeast infection will cause vaginal itching, burning and a very characteristic thick white discharge that looks much like cottage cheese. The diagnosis can often be made by examination alone but if necessary can be confirmed by examining the discharge under a microscope or by doing a culture. There are many over-the-counter treatments available that are effective. Prescription medications can be given for resistant cases.

Other possible disrupting factors include poorly controlled diabetes, pregnancy or problems with one’s immune system.

“Probiotics,” which are capsules containing live bacteria, and yogurt have been advocated by some for use in vaginal yeast infections, but it is not clear that they are actually helpful.

Yeast infections can also affect other parts of the body. Moist, warm areas are especially susceptible. Many severe cases of diaper rash are caused by yeast, since the area under the diaper — despite best efforts — is often warm and moist. Likewise, women with large pendulous breasts will often develop yeast infections where the breasts continuously rub against the chest wall.

The mouth is also a frequent site of yeast infections. This is common in people who wear dentures or who have weakened immune systems due to such problems as cancer, HIV or diabetes.

Not all yeast cells are harmful. Yeast is used to make bread and cheese and to produce beer and wine. It's almost as if they are paying us back for all the trouble they cause.",29/10/2014
NewsDay,Chembio to work on rapid tests for dengue fever and cancer,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. announced Tuesday that it has signed agreements with two companies to develop rapid tests for dengue fever virus and an undisclosed type of cancer.

NewsDay,Chembio Diagnostics joining biotech firm to develop rapid test for Ebola,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. in Medford announced Monday that it would work with a Maryland-based biotechnology company on a new test for Ebola.

Executives said Chembio's point-of-care testing technology, already used to detect HIV and syphilis, could allow for quicker diagnosis of Ebola because tests can be performed at doctor's offices, clinics and in rural villages instead of samples being taken from patients and transported to a hospital or laboratory in a city for testing.

Test results would be known in minutes, not hours or days. And patients wouldn't have to travel far distances to be diagnosed, said John J. Sperzel, Chembio's chief executive.

Early detection is seen as crucial to surviving Ebola, which in the ongoing outbreak has claimed more than 4,900 lives in West Africa and one in the United States so far.

Chembio plans to combine its testing expertise with Ebola antibodies from Integrated BioTherapeutics Inc. in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Integrated, which develops vaccines and therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, works with federal health care agencies such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

M. Javad Aman, president of Integrated, said, ""Development of a rapid point-of-care test for Ebola will be a critical step towards enabling early detection and quarantine that could help save countless lives.""

Sperzel said the partnership is an outgrowth of a Chembio test -- developed last year with the federal government -- for five febrile illnesses, which are characterized by high fever, also a trait of Ebola. That test, now in clinical trials, doesn't yet detect Ebola, but Chembio hopes to expand the test's capability.

""Historically vaccines have been extremely successful and the biggest example of that is the smallpox vaccine because it stopped one of the world's most infectious viruses,"" said Glatt, a specialist in infectious diseases.

A planned study by the allergy and infectious diseases institute will enroll 39 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65. They are to be divided into groups to receive either the experimental Ebola vaccine or a placebo. Early-round volunteers will probably be health care workers.

The institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is developing vaccines and medications to aid a growing Ebola defense.

The latest candidate vaccine is an experimental Canadian product called VSV-ZEBOV. Federal scientists plan to test it for safety and its capacity to generate an immune response. Researchers will examine the blood of volunteers who receive VSV-ZEBOV for evidence of Ebola antibodies.

Antibodies are minuscule Y-shaped proteins that neutralize pathogens. Volunteers will be given two intramuscular doses, a strategy known as a prime-boost.

Walter Reed Army Institute of Research is simultaneously testing VSV-ZEBOV as a single-dose vaccine at its clinical trials center in Maryland.

""The need for a vaccine to protect against Ebola infection is urgent,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

On Friday he explained there hadn't been much need for an Ebola vaccine in the past because before the epidemic, the infection had stricken fewer than 2,500 people in 40 years. The current outbreak accentuates the need for a vaccine, Fauci said.

VSV-ZEBOV contains a genetically engineered version of the vesicular stomatitis virus -- VSV -- which generally infects rodents, cattle and swine. VSV infections in humans are rare and don't cause disease, scientists said.

In the vaccine, the gene for the outer protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus has been replaced with a segment of a gene from the Zaire Ebola strain, which lies at the heart of the outbreak. The vaccine cannot cause an individual inoculated with it to develop Ebola because only a noninfectious segment of the gene has been used.

Dr. David Hirschwerk, an infectious diseases specialist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, said candidate vaccines are not always the preventives scientists had sought. Some products, he said, simply don't work when tested in clinical trials.

""There are certain pathogens for which there are no vaccines,"" said Hirschwerk, referring to HIV, dengue and malaria.

Testing of another Ebola vaccine codeveloped by institute scientists and researchers at GlaxoSmithKline began last month. About a million doses can be ready by the end of 2015, GSK officials say.

Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, plans a vaccine trial in West Africa starting in January. The effort will be conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization and Bavarian Nordic, a pharmaceutical firm in Denmark.

Johnson & Johnson officials say the company is investing $200 million in Ebola vaccine development. Company scientists are working on a vaccine that targets only Ebola Zaire and another that targets multiple Ebola strains.",25/10/2014
NewsDay,"Blood plasma transfusions from Ebola survivors could help treat disease, experts say","Doctors have turned to an age-old form of antiviral therapy in the fight against Ebola.

The treatment, endorsed by the World Health Organization, involves infusing blood plasma from convalescing survivors into a newly diagnosed patient.

Amid a growing Ebola crisis in West Africa and no proven therapy or vaccine, WHO also has issued interim guidance on the collection, storage and use of blood plasma from survivors in the convalescent phase. Their blood, WHO officials say, is rich in infection-fighting antibodies.

""Desperate times call for desperate measures,"" Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, said referring to the infusions.

At least one of the two infected Dallas nurses, Nina Pham, 26, received a plasma transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, the medical missionary who was infected while treating Ebola patients in Liberia.

Pham was flown late last week to the National Institutes of Health's Clinical Center, the premier research hospital in the United States, for further care.

She contracted Ebola while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian national who died nearly two weeks ago.

Another nurse to contract Ebola, Amber Vinson, was being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

Doctor: 'In theory it works'

Farber said the plasma treatment is a throwback to the 1920s and '30s when it was more widely -- but not always successfully -- used.

In those days, plasma therapy filled a void in an era devoid of antimicrobials and was administered to patients with either bacterial or viral infections.

""Blood consists of two major components, the red cells and the plasma,"" Farber said, explaining that when blood is centrifuged -- spun at high speed -- it separates into the two constituents. The plasma portion contains the antibodies.

Antibodies, infection-fighting proteins, develop following exposure to a virus, such as Ebola. Infusing a newly diagnosed patient with it provides the protein components to fend off the disease.

""In theory it works,"" Farber said, ""but it basically requires that you have enough antibodies in the plasma for the process to be effective.

""It's certainly important to emphasize that there are many questions as to its efficacy, especially for it to work on a large scale. In that case, you would need a large pool of survivors for it to be useful.""

Farber said plasma treatments never could be considered a cure and they have not worked in numerous infections, particularly HIV.

Plasma infusions, nevertheless, offer an expeditious way to provide therapy for a virus at the center of an explosive outbreak.

West Africa cases skyrocket

Although the Ebola virus has been known since 1976, the infection never threatened populations the way it does now.

In the past, it largely had been a sporadic problem in Central Africa in relatively small outbreaks, according to WHO data. Its recent emergence in West Africa has taken global health experts by surprise.

The exponential growth of the disease is decimating populations in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- and there is no end in sight to the skyrocketing number of cases, WHO officials say.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 8,997 total cases of the disease in the three countries since spring, and 5,006 laboratory-confirmed cases.

The official number of deaths was 4,493 as of Friday, but experts say hundreds -- possibly thousands -- of people may have died without ever being officially counted.

It is the continuing expansion of the highly contagious infection that poses a threat to the rest of the world, experts say.

""Regardless of whether you think Ebola is going to turn into a pandemic or you're worried for your children or you operate from compassion, the only way to guarantee safety for all is to end the epidemic at its source,"" said global health expert Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan. Garrett, formerly of Newsday, reported on a major Central African outbreak of Ebola in the 1990s.

New studies on immunity

Some scientists see the outbreak as raising new lines of research, especially regarding human immunity.

Last week in the medical journal The Lancet, scientists from the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the University of Texas in Austin found that while Ebola kills some people, it may be immunizing others.

Dr. Steve Bellan said a proportion of people in West Africa are exposed to the virus but do not develop infection. ""There is evidence that this may happen frequently,"" Bellan said Friday. ""And this may be an important missing piece in how Ebola is interacting with the population.""

Bellan said it's unknown whether the exposure amounts to long-term immunity. He doubts that antibodies from someone who was exposed but didn't develop symptoms would be appropriate for a plasma infusion.

Dr. Vincent Racaniello, the Higgins Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University in Manhattan, said while there are some unknowns about the virus, there are several features that are well established. It will never become airborne, he said.

""Viruses are transmitted in a certain way and it's very, very difficult for them to change,"" Racaniello, a virologist, said. ""Changing makes viruses very sick.

""So it is fixed,"" he said of the mode of transmission.",18/10/2014
NewsDay,Nassau first responders learn how to handle Ebola patients,"Two fire marshals slowly and carefully got into and out of a water-resistant protective suit as Nassau County first responders relearned the buddy system at Nassau University Medical Center Thursday night.

The protective equipment is impermeable and includes a face mask, double gloves, a full bodysuit with a hood and goggles. It's meant to protect health care workers and first responders from patients exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.

Dr. Victor Politi, NUMC's CEO, told about 200 first responders and health care workers what they should do if they think a patient has Ebola. Firefighters and emergency medical technicians responding to calls should wear protective gear, expose as few people as possible to the virus, and ask questions about a patient's travel history, he said.

""You're used to running into HIV, tuberculosis, H1N1, SARS. . . . We've heard it all, it doesn't stop you guys,"" Politi said. ""The reason that we feel confident in doing these things is we know what we're up against and how to protect ourselves.""

He said that after first responders take a suspected Ebola patient to the hospital, EMTs and firefighters would go through decontamination. Then, they would be monitored closely for 21 days for symptoms of the disease. Their protective gear would be discarded at the hospital, and their ambulance would be left there.

""That ambulance should be placed out of service,"" Politi said. ""We don't have an exact amount of time on how long these viruses will last.""

Dispatchers and health care workers are being taught to ask questions about a patient's travel history and whether they have flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, aches and pains, and vomiting or diarrhea, he said. Because it's also flu season, he said, it's crucial for first responders to determine what the illness is by asking many questions.

Hands in the audience shot up over and over to ask logistical questions about dealing with patients and decontamination. Kurt Joseph, 25, a volunteer with the South Hempstead Fire Department, said he came to the lecture hoping to learn more about the equipment needed to deal with a possible Ebola patient. He said he learned the key is not to panic and to ask the right questions of the patient. ""I feel more informed, I think that's the most important thing,"" Joseph said. ""It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.""",16/10/2014
NewsDay,O'Reilly: U.S. can't afford pandemic of Ebola fear,"""Many, including one of the senators today, used the analogy of a fire burning out of control to describe this unprecedented outbreak. Indeed it is a fire. It is a fire straight from the pit of hell. We cannot fool ourselves into thinking the vast moat of the Atlantic Ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire. Instead we must move quickly and immediately to deliver the promises made and to be open to practical innovative interventions. This is the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes.""

-- Ebola survivor Kenneth Brantly in congressional remarks

When we learned about the Ebola case in Dallas on Tuesday, it was hard not to think of a line from the film ""Jurassic Park"" spoken by actor Jeff Goldblum. He plays a chaos-theory expert who is dubious to all assurances that reconstituted dinosaurs cannot reproduce.

""I'm simply saying that life, uh, finds a way,"" Goldblum warns. And later in the film, of course, he is proven correct. Life finds a way.

The movie line springs to mind because the Ebola virus is a living thing, too. It seeks to reproduce as vivaciously as a ""Jurassic Park"" velociraptor or any spring rabbit. Indeed, despite all assurances from government officials in recent weeks that Ebola wouldn't reach American shores organically, here it is in all its perniciousness -- at least in one man. (Two other Ebola victims were previously flown to the United States under strict quarantine for treatment.)

Not good.

A second thing that springs to mind at news of the U.S. Ebola case is Daniel Defoe's ""A Journal of the Plague Year."" The 1722 classic is a fictionalized daily account of 1665 London as it was ravaged by the Great Plague. Defoe spends as much time in ""Plague Year"" describing the fatalism and panic amid the populace as he does discussing the plague itself:

""While the fears of the people were young, they were increased strangely by several odd accidents which, put altogether, it was really a wonder the whole body of the people did not rise as one man and abandon their dwellings . . . I shall name but a few of these things; but sure they were so many, and so many wizards and cunning people propagating them, that I have often wondered there was any (women especially) left behind.""

I was amazed Tuesday night to see how quickly the conspiracists and blame-gamers got to work in the comment sections of online news stories on Ebola. Within three hours of the Dallas case being reported, accusations were flying as to the people responsible for this case landing on U.S. soil. Doomsday predictions of all varieties were proffered. I suppose that's natural to some extent; it's where the mind goes when there's fear in the air. I confess to worrying in 1983 about mosquitoes transmitting the blood-borne virus that would later become known as HIV. I know I wasn't alone.

It's too early to know what will become of the Ebola infection in Dallas. With any luck, it will remain an isolated case; the people with whom the victim interacted will be found and tested and we will have dodged a bullet. But if a second and a third case are discovered in the United States -- or if there is an outbreak in Canada or Central America -- it's going to be tough to rein in the fear. Americans are going to need information and a firm hand at the tiller.

President Barack Obama should begin providing that today. America has enough problems right now. A pandemic of fear cannot be allowed to occur.

NewsDay,NYC promotes acceptance of controversial HIV drug,"New York City's health department is advertising on gay hookup apps and lobbying doctors to promote wider use of a controversial anti-HIV pill that vastly cuts the risk of infection. But the therapy has stoked infighting among AIDS activists over promiscuity and safer sex practices.

Officials lament that the blue pill, Truvada, remains unpopular among uninfected gay men at greatest risk for HIV, despite its endorsement by federal and global public health agencies for what is known as ""pre-exposure prophylaxis,"" or PrEP.

Truvada originally was used to treat just those who were HIV positive. It was approved in 2012 as a preventive option and is now recommended for men who aren't diligent about condom use during gay sex. The pill, to be taken daily, costs up to $1,800 monthly but is covered by most insurance and heavily subsidized for those who can't afford it. A major study found it to be more than 90 percent effective.

Yet, nationwide only 2,319 people started PrEP between January 2012 and September 2013, according to drugmaker Gilead. That's fewer than the more than 3,000 new HIV cases reported each year in the city alone. HIV is the virus that, untreated, can lead to AIDS, wrecking the immune system's ability to fight off deadly diseases.

""There's this huge infighting going on around PrEP in the gay community, a lot of finger-pointing around this particular drug, which is unfortunate,"" said New York University professor Perry Halkitis, an HIV expert.

Some AIDS activists, including an older generation that saw the disease's devastating toll before lifesaving drugs were introduced, are among PrEP's most ardent foes.

Larry Kramer, the playwright and a hero of the movement, caused a stir in May when he called PrEP users ""cowardly"" and questioned why anyone would choose to ""poison"" oneself with antivirals like PrEP instead of simply using condoms.

A stigma persists that Truvada is a ""party pill"" -- an attitude shared by some doctors who scold patients about their sexual practices and won't prescribe it, said Anthony Hayes, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, which backs PrEP. The journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that 74 percent of surveyed clinicians back PrEP, yet only 9 percent had prescribed it.

Enter Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the health department's new assistant commissioner for HIV/AIDS control and prevention. Previously a top AIDS doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital, he is a self-described ""gay health warrior.""

""There's not a lot of doctors who can say, 'I've done thousands of HIV [blood] tests with my hands in dark sex clubs,' "" he said. ""I have done that.""

The city is spending about $500,000 to encourage PrEP, with outreach to doctors and ads on Facebook, Twitter and hookup apps like Grindr and Scruff. Says one ad: ""Share the Night, Not HIV."" Among those in Daskalakis' focus: young black and Latino men, who studies find at higher risk because of the amount of the virus in the population and health care disparities.

The city's PrEP push is misguided, said Michael Weinstein, head of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which serves 200,000 patients globally.

""The first order of business in medical ethics is 'do no harm,' and what the New York City Health Department's doing is doing harm, because there are people who are going to take this drug intermittently, who are going to think they're protected, who are going to not be protected,"" Weinstein said.

PrEP critics say users who fail to take the pill daily could still risk HIV infection. Weinstein fears the therapy encourages condomless sex and thus the danger of other sexually transmitted infections. Potential side effects include kidney and bone problems.

Daskalakis counters that PrEP can still do good even if some doses are missed, its side effects either fade or are manageable, and studies show no meaningful change in condom use by those on the therapy: ""Could there be an increased rate of STIs? Yeah. Absolutely. Ultimately PrEP is a harm-reduction approach, not a harm-elimination approach.""

PrEP's backers say they do preach condom use but are being realistic: Not everyone uses them all the time.

""We're not going to say we love it,"" Daskalakis said, ""but at least we have something for you.""",30/09/2014
NewsDay,Number of heroin deaths on Long Island soars,"An Editor’s Note published July 12, 2017, about Kevin Deutsch’s reporting appears at the end of this story.

Heroin killed a record-high 144 people on Long Island in 2013, as an oversaturated drug market forced street prices for the drug down and addicts continued to turn away from costly opioid pain pills, according to government records.

The newly released data show deaths linked to heroin rose in both counties last year. The drug, which played a role in 38 overdose deaths in Suffolk in 2010, killed 100 people in 2013, county records show. In Nassau, where heroin was linked to 23 overdose deaths in 2010, 44 people died of heroin overdoses in 2013, records show.

As heroin claimed more lives, opioid pain pills killed fewer people than in years past. In Suffolk, pain pills containing opioid medications -- oxycodone, hydrocodone and hydromorphone -- played a role in 137 overdose deaths in 2012 and 107 in 2013, records show. In Nassau, opioid pills were linked to 56 overdose deaths in 2012 and 43 in 2013, records show.

At least 15 additional fatal overdoses in Nassau during 2012, and 20 more during 2013, were caused by undetermined opiates -- either pain pills or heroin, records show.

Officials said the overdose totals are subject to change and may rise as new autopsy and toxicology results are finalized. The data show that the impact of heroin and opioid pills on Long Island families -- as well as the region's schools, businesses and treatment centers -- continues to be immeasurable, experts say.

Young men and women are losing jobs due to heroin and opioid addiction, officials say; school-age children are growing up in homes of parents who use; and spots in detoxification programs for young people are in high demand and, in many cases, available only after monthslong waits.

""Use continues to increase, as does the damage done by these substances,"" said Steven Chassman, clinical director at the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, which provides substance abuse services. ""They're causing deaths and a host of dysfunction among adolescents and Long Island families.""

Also rising are the number of people seeking treatment for heroin and opioid pill addiction on Long Island, experts say. Six years ago, before the opioid epidemic, LICADD typically saw between 300 and 450 people a month at their facilities.

Last month, the organization saw more than 1,030 people -- the highest intake total in its 58-year history, said executive director Rosalba Messina.

Available 'everywhere'Current and former heroin users say they have never seen so much strong, cheap product flooding local drug markets.

""Everywhere I go, every party, every neighborhood, it's there and it's cheap,"" said David Coughlan, a recovering heroin addict from Mastic whose cousin, Avery Coughlan, died of a heroin overdose in Brooklyn in 2012. ""When you see a kid, 15, 16 years old shooting up or snorting, it's sad. But that's the way things are right now.""

These are among the trends involving heroin abuse in Nassau and Suffolk:

An increase in HIV and hepatitis transmissions tied to intravenous needle sharing, according to health care providers. Specific Islandwide data on such transmissions were not available, but treatment experts say anecdotal evidence points to a significant rise in infections among heroin users.

Narcan, the antidote naloxone, which reverses the toxic effects of opiates overdose, has saved the lives of hundreds of heroin and opioid pill users, including 240 in Suffolk County alone since August 2010, said Dr. Scott Coyne, the Suffolk police department's chief surgeon and medical director. In Nassau, from January through August 2014, paramedics saved about 123 lives with Narcan, according to county statistics.

The oversaturated market for heroin is largely due to a glut shipped here via Mexican drug cartels, including the infamous Sinaloa cartel, federal officials say. With supply at record levels, a bag of potent heroin can be had for as little as $5 on Long Island, officials say, while an 80-milligram opioid pill typically sells for $80 on the black market.

Users who have died of heroin or opioid pill overdoses in Nassau and Suffolk since 2012 have been overwhelmingly white, records show.

The Town of Brookhaven had the highest number of fatal drug overdoses in 2013 (104) in Suffolk, while the Massapequa area has seen the highest number of opioid overdose deaths (20) of any Nassau community since 2012.

Suffolk County authorities alone have destroyed roughly 18,000 pounds of drugs -- many of them prescription pills -- turned in anonymously to county police since 2010, said Chief of Detectives William Madigan.

The Long Island heroin market has become more intertwined with that of New York City, where heroin overdose deaths doubled over the past three years -- from 209 in 2010 to 420 last year, according to city records, treatment experts and law enforcement officials.

""A lot of people, myself included, used to buy in the city. But now the same suppliers are moving their product out to Long Island, so it's basically the same quality and price in a lot of neighborhoods,"" Coughlan said. ""The borders of the city . . . the city versus the suburbs . . . those things don't matter anymore to customers.""

Officials taking stepsDespite the grim indicators, local officials have hope that heroin deaths may start to wane in 2015.

Among the reasons: Increased use and availability of Narcan in drug-plagued neighborhoods; more participation in I-STOP, New York State's online tracking of opioid pill prescriptions; and two new state laws -- one that will require insurers to cover treatment for drug and alcohol abuse and dependency starting next year, and another that makes homeowners civilly liable for failure to try to get help for overdosing users. ""We're hoping it makes a difference and things get better for these families,"" said Linda Ventura of Kings Park, who led the effort for the insurance legislation after her son Thomas, 21, died of a heroin overdose in 2012. ""Things have to change.""

Editor’s note: Newsday undertook an extensive, four-month review of reporting by Kevin Deutsch, who covered law enforcement from April 2012 to September 2016.

The review of the former Newsday reporter’s work began after The Baltimore Sun this year reported that law enforcement and other officials questioned the veracity of Deutsch’s nonfiction book “Pill City” about Baltimore’s drug trade. In addition, questions arose about individuals named in Newsday stories by Deutsch. Book publisher St. Martin’s Press and Deutsch have said they stand behind the book.

We are dedicated to accurate, factual reporting, to the highest journalistic standards and to maintaining our credibility with Newsday readers. We also are committed to being accountable to our readers. Newsday undertook the detailed review in that spirit and because of the concerns that were raised.

In late February, as our review was under way, The New York Times reported in an editor’s note that The Times “had been unable to locate or confirm the existence of two people who were named and quoted” in a Dec. 29, 2016, freelance article written by Deutsch. Deutsch “maintains that the interviews and the descriptions are accurate,” The Times wrote.

Newsday reviewed 600 stories with reporting by Deutsch. We contacted officials in the police departments regularly involved in Deutsch’s coverage. They said they had not had problems with his work. We then focused our research and reporting on individuals who, as described in the stories, would not be considered officials, or well-known, public figures.

The review found 77 stories with 109 individuals from Deutsch’s reporting whom Newsday could not locate. The main points of the stories were not affected. While two stories about the Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen were based on sources Newsday could not locate, other media reported the main points of those stories but with attribution from different sources. In this story, Newsday could not locate: David Coughlan and his cousin Avery Coughlan. Newsday is attaching an editor’s note to each story online that contains individuals we cannot locate.

Here’s how Newsday conducted the review:

Researchers and reporters searched local and national public records, sites providing nationwide people searches, databases of business, real estate and conviction records, social media sites including Facebook, LinkedIn and Ancestry.com and nationwide news archives. They searched potential alternate spellings and other name variations. Their reporting followed potential leads they found through research, within stories and in information shared by Deutsch during the review.

Finding people after publication, in some cases years later, can be difficult because of changes in residence, circumstance and contact information. Some may not have given their real names.

On the law enforcement beat, reporters may encounter people who lead lives that are not reflected in public records or other sources of information that would help locate them. It is possible that some on our list were difficult to find or reluctant to respond to our review because they are undocumented immigrants, those battling or recovering from addiction or people involved in or around illegal activity.

Some on our list were described discussing crimes in their neighborhoods, and others as relatives, friends or neighbors of victims or as individuals living near or knowing those accused of crimes.

Others we have not been able to locate, though, are described as bystanders, neighbors, spectators, relatives of drug victims, witnesses to news events or related in some way to people in the news. Still others are described in stories as people actively engaged in public issues, such as activists, protesters and marchers. Many individuals on the list are described as local.

Deutsch said in email exchanges with Newsday that “I have no doubt about the veracity of the claims of the sources I quoted.” He also said, “Not a single public official, source, or other interviewee has raised any issues with even one of these stories.”

“It's impossible for any reporter to know whether the name given to him by interviewees on the street--or those reached briefly by phone or email-- is that person's full and legal name, rather than an alias or variation of their real name (maiden names and certain common nicknames/abbreviations for first names are often published by newspapers, including Newsday.). But every one of the names on Newsday’s list was the name given to me by that interview subject, verbatim.”

During the four months of our review, Newsday shared questions and updates with Deutsch as we progressed in the search for individuals we could not locate. We requested notes and contact information. Deutsch sent us notes he said represented all individuals we were unable to locate and responded over the course of the review by email, sharing information he said was from his recollection and notes.

Reporters followed up on all information shared by Deutsch. He did not provide contact information for those on our list. Newsday reporters and editors sought unsuccessfully several times to meet with Deutsch to discuss his reporting and to review his notes together to ensure we were not missing contact information or other details that might help locate individuals. Deutsch maintained that the notes he shared “serve as evidence of interviews” with each source.

Deutsch said he kept contact information in a Rolodex he left behind at Newsday’s main office and in a company-issued cellphone he returned within a week after resigning on Sept. 6, 2016. Editorial staff did not find a Rolodex or other notes at our office, but found notes left at Newsday’s desk at a courthouse pressroom where he worked. We shared them with Deutsch and he confirmed they were his. As per company policy, the contents of the cellphone had been deleted immediately after Deutsch returned it to Newsday.

Maintaining the trust of our readers is essential to our mission. If we are able subsequently to locate any individuals, we will update our stories.",20/09/2014
NewsDay,"Global Citizen Festival: Jay Z, No Doubt, more stars aim to impact world poverty with free Central Park concert","The Global Citizen Festival won't be like the star-studded concerts of years past -- international, awareness-raising events like Live Aid, Live 8 and Live Earth.

Sure, there will still be plenty of stars on Central Park's Great Lawn when the festival takes over Saturday. Jay Z and No Doubt are the concert headliners, with Carrie Underwood, fun., The Roots and Tiesto also on the bill. Multitalented showman Hugh Jackman is set to host, with actresses Katie Holmes, Olivia Wilde and Allison Williams signed on as presenters.

But festival founder Hugh Evans, CEO of The Global Poverty Project, says that in these Internet-driven days, people have more power than ever to change public policy, especially when they band together.

""Raising awareness for the sake of awareness is dead,"" Evans says. ""We can affect the lives of the world's poor now.""

The Global Citizen Festival uses an unusual method of getting the concert's message out -- utilizing the show's attention before, during and after the event.

Tickets for the concert aren't for sale. They are awarded to fans only after they have taken action to spread the word about the event's goals to help end extreme poverty in the world by 2030.

""We have one overarching objective -- we want to impact the lives of 50 million people worldwide,"" Evans says, adding that organizers have three concrete ways in mind of doing that. They are calling on the Norwegian government to increase its investment in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, a plan that seems to have worked since Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg is expected to attend the event to make an announcement. They are also asking the World Bank to increase its investment in sanitation, as well as asking the Indian government to increase its sanitation efforts. The final piece of their plan is to offer girls around the world more access to education -- an effort supported by Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teen who was shot by the Taliban for her efforts to get girls educated -- by asking the Canadian government to invest more in international education.

The directness of the group's approach made a fan out of Jay Z, who volunteered last year to work on this year's festival. ""Change only takes place when and where there is action,"" Jay Z says in a statement announcing his involvement. ""I'm joining the 2014 Global Citizen Festival because I believe through actions, whether it be by raising awareness, getting involved, or educating ourselves, the goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is possible.""

Evans -- who began his crusade against poverty as a teenager, after he visited Smokey Mountain in the Philippines, a garbage dump where people live -- believes the goal is achievable as well.

""The last 15 years have been the most successful anti-poverty push in human history,"" Evans says. ""More people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 15 years than in the 200 years prior to that.""

However, there is plenty more work to be done. Evans says he believes that by getting more people involved, especially passionate music fans, the mix of encouragement and pressure from those involved in the Global Citizen movement could create the political environment needed to finish the job.

And his movement is clearly growing. This year, the Global Citizen Festival will be broadcast live for the first time on MSNBC, with an hourlong prime-time special of highlights on NBC airing the same night.

Jackman, besides hosting the event, has been supporting the festival where he can. During his recent appearance on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" Jackman sported a new Global Citizen Festival T-shirt -- one sold exclusively at the event's new pop-up store at the Paramount Hotel in Manhattan, part of the group's new ""Impack,"" designed to help people engaged in the cause year-round.

""I am thrilled to be a part of this year's Global Citizen Festival to further the movement to end extreme poverty,"" Jackman says in a statement. ""This is a cause that has been close to my heart for many years, and I look forward to joining 60,000 Global Citizens in Central Park as we change the world for the better.""

Evans says he is not naive in his belief that this kind of seismic change is possible.

""It's not a pie-in-the-sky fanciful notion that I'm just excited about for and giggles,"" Evans says. ""It's something I have focused my life on . . . I believe it can happen. It won't happen easily, but it could happen.""

NewsDay,Dennis Basso pays tribute to 'dear friend' Joan Rivers,"You could hear a pin drop at Dennis Basso’s Monday afternoon runway show, as the designer asked for a moment of silence for his “dear friend” Joan Rivers, who was always a fixture at his fashion shows.

Before the show started, Basso addressed the audience, saying that Rivers “brought laughter and happiness to all of our lives.”

In other Rivers-related fashion news, the E! Entertainment booth at the tents was a hive of activity -- the first time since the entertainer’s death -- with Kimora Lee Simmons and Coco Rocha filming. And at the HSN event nearby at the Empire Hotel, poor Giuliana Rancic, River’s “Fashion Police” co-star, was obviously -- and understandably -- distraught.",08/09/2014
NewsDay,Roundup: Village gets official building department,"The Village of Port Washington North is getting its official building department.

Village trustees authorized the establishment of the department and the position of superintendent of buildings in a 3-0 vote Tuesday night.

Mayor Bob Weitzner has said the village always maintained an informal department and needed to pass the law to accommodate appointing a building superintendent.

Previously, the village had two building inspectors managing the department. A superintendent of buildings signals an authority figure in the department, in case an issue arises between a resident and inspector that needs to be appealed or reconsidered, the mayor said.

“I’m pleased that the board supported this change,” Weitzner said Wednesday. “It certainly will be better for our residents in establishing a better management structure within the department, and people should come by and check it out.”

SUFFOLK COUNTY

Loan helps nonprofit refinance homes

A Smithtown nonprofit will receive a $3.3 million loan from a Manhattan nonprofit lender to refinance nine houses for disabled people.

The houses, located in Brookhaven and Islip towns and owned by Options for Community Living, provide shelter and support services for 34 residents with mental illness, AIDS or HIV, or other chronic health conditions, according to a news release from the Community Preservation Corporation.

The corporation provided the loan to Options for Community Living, which operates more than 150 sites housing more than 1,000 adults and children, according to its website.

“Supportive housing ensures that the state’s most vulnerable populations have the basic tools necessary to maximize their ability to live independently,” Michael Skrebutenas, senior vice president of the corporation, said in a statement.

The corporation, which specializes in affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization projects, reported it has invested about $70 million in more than 600 housing units in Suffolk County since it was founded in 1974.

NewsDay,Fire Island forum tout benefits of breakthrough HIV blocker,"End-of-summer celebrations at Fire Island's gay community kicked off on an unusually sober note this weekend, with a forum focused on a breakthrough HIV-blocker that has drawn controversy.

The pill -- if taken daily -- prevents HIV from taking hold in about 90 percent of high-risk individuals, including gay and bisexual men, people whose partners have HIV, and adult drug users.

Truvada, which hit the market about two years ago, has been heralded as a key to eradicating HIV. Critics fear the drug creates a false sense of security that can encourage risky behavior, reduce condom use, and spike sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis C cases.

""I think that if you are on it, it carries a stigma,"" said David Atia, 25, of New York City, who was visiting The Pines with friends.

About 55 people attended the Saturday afternoon forum at Whyte Hall hosted by Gay Men's Health Crisis, a New York City nonprofit, to learn about the daily HIV-prevention strategy and a monthlong therapy for accidental exposures.

Though now healthy, Osvaldo Perdomo, secretary to the GMHC board of directors, said he reserved a cemetery plot years ago, after he proved resistant to some of the first AIDS drugs.

""I'm here today to make sure that doesn't happen to you,"" he told the audience.

For some, however, Truvada use is a red flag, suggesting multiple sex partners or other high-risk activities. Experts advise also using condoms, and studies show that users of the drug often skip so many doses that they lose the drug's protection.

Those are some of the obstacles New York State must overcome to achieve its 2020 goal of ending the HIV epidemic by reducing the number of new infections to about 750 a year -- the number of people tuberculosis strikes each year.

About 3,000 people statewide contracted HIV this year, down from 14,000 in 1993, according to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. But the ranks of those with HIV and AIDS are rising because many are living longer.

People accidentally exposed to the virus can get the same anti-HIV medicine prescribed for daily use from hospital emergency rooms, the experts said.

The pill works best if taken within 36 hours of exposure, but must be taken within 72 hours. Experts say the deadlines are missed all too often.

""It breaks our heart each and every time we hear that,"" said Lynnette Ford, a GMHC official who works out of a Chelsea intake center.

Truvada costs about $13,000 a year; health insurance usually picks up the tab. In New York, Medicaid will pay. A generic version is sold overseas.

""This is a new option; we already know people aren't using condoms 100 percent of the time,"" said Kelsey Louie, GMHC chief executive.

Younger people -- especially men of color -- have the highest rates of contracting HIV, partly because they lack the caution of their elders, having grown up in an era when AIDS was treatable, not lethal.

""I want everybody here to think about who you're going to talk to this weekend about PREP,"" Louie said.

He was using the acronym for the daily therapy: pre-exposure prophylaxis. The emergency treatment is PEP, post exposure prophylaxis.",31/08/2014
NewsDay,Businesses hire lobbyists in push for legal marijuana -- and big profits,"DENVER — Two decades ago, Dean Petkanas was vice president of corporate finance for Stratton Oakmont, the Long Island stock firm whose collapse was made famous in the 2013 film ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""

Now the Huntington-based entrepreneur is looking to become a big winner in a new risky venture — the business of marijuana. The opportunities for moneymaking range from ""edibles,"" such as candy infused with marijuana, to a high-tech computer firm looking to link up patients with doctors.

""This is an industry that is in its infancy,"" explained Petkanas, here to confer with potential partners in Colorado where marijuana is legal, earning millions for investors with both medical and recreational uses. ""You're probably going to have a major gold rush in each state.""

Hoping for the same success in New York, Petkanas, head of KannaLife Sciences Inc., and other firms seeking to capitalize on the legalization of marijuana hired top lobbyists — including Park Strategies LLC, the firm owned by former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, and the Mercury public strategy firm — to persuade state lawmakers in June to end the century-old prohibition on marijuana and make it legal for medicinal purposes.

For 17 years in Albany, pro-pot advocacy groups such as NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) had pushed a bill to legalize medical marijuana without any luck. But the arrival of lobbyists and big-money investors in the past two years propelled the idea forward.

The new medical marijuana law, signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in July, bans smokable marijuana but allows doctors to prescribe marijuana through oils, vapor and other edible forms to treat patients with cancer, epilepsy and other specific illnesses. The new law won't take effect for about 18 months, and not until a program is created to select state-approved growers and dispensers of the drug.

""This is not a Cheech-and-Chong bill,"" said Patrick McCarthy, a former top aide to Gov. George Pataki and now managing director of Mercury, about the state legislation that eventually led to the state's regulated use of medical marijuana. McCarthy says his firm has advised Petkanas and Gaia Plant-Based Medicine, a large, successful Colorado marijuana grower and dispensary firm, looking to start up operations in New York if allowed. "" 'Medical marijuana' was once code for legalization,"" but that's no longer the case, McCarthy contends.

While some lobbyists represent growers or packagers, D'Amato's firm represents Ideal 420 Technologies, a firm with offices in New York and New Hampshire that sells a sort of Miracle-Gro for pot. ""We have developed the world's first true marijuana soil,"" boasts the company, with a reference in its name to ""420,"" a common phrase that means ""marijuana friendly"" among users. ""Our soil — a carefully selected blend of vital nutrients and one that only requires watering — grows the highest quality marijuana in the marketplace.""

D'Amato, who as a U.S. senator once posed famously for a photo as an undercover cop in the 1980s war on drugs, recently acknowledged he's had a change of heart.

""I know it's a tough pill to swallow, and if you asked me five years ago if I would ever consider supporting legalizing medical marijuana, I would've say, 'Not a chance,' "" wrote D'Amato in a February column in the LI Herald, a local publication. ""But times are changing, and marijuana has become a viable form of alternative medicine for those suffering from many debilitating diseases such as ALS, multiple sclerosis, cancer and others. When traditional medicines fail to offer relief, why not give patients alternatives?""

Overall, Ideal 420 is prepared to pay D'Amato's firm as much as $200,000 this year for its lobbying work, said co-founder Richard Yost, who hopes to become a key supplier for medical marijuana in New York. ""You have to understand New York politics,"" explained Yost about his lobbying effort for the medical marijuana bill. ""It's a Republican issue in the Senate, and Park Strategies has a strong relationship on that side.""

Already in the first six months this year, Park Strategies was paid $90,000 to lobby for Ideal 420, state records show. A spokeswoman for Park Strategies declined to comment.

The debate about a new marijuana industry for New York — worth potentially as much as $250 million in tax revenue, according to proponents — created a strange set of bedfellows who say they're happy to be working together.

""Business interests are definitely looking at this and hiring lobbyists to work in Albany, primarily around the issue of medical marijuana, because we are a lot closer on that,"" said Doug Greene, legislative director for Empire State NORML, which also advocates that recreational use of marijuana (or ""nonmedical,"" as he prefers) be legalized. ""Historically, we are at the point where we are finally having a conversation about the regulation and taxation of marijuana.""

Economic boom predicted

Erik A. Williams, a spokesman for Gaia Plant-Based Medicine, said a coalition of business interests, lobbyists and advocacy groups worked to help make marijuana legal in New York for the first time. ""The more voices across the board that are involved, then that's fantastic,"" Williams said. ""The bottom line on this issue is that it's nonpartisan. It's one of the most nonpartisan issues in this country.""

In the near future, Williams said he foresees warehouses in Hauppauge or outdoor farms on the East End that could be growing marijuana legally. ""There's an absolutely amazing economic boom that can come from this,"" he said, walking through a cavernous warehouse facility in suburban Denver where various marijuana plants, at different stages of growth, are cultivated for sale. ""Right here in this facility, we employ 60 persons already. What we've seen here in Colorado is millions of square feet in retail and warehouse space have been rented. The jobs are incredible. The taxes are incredible.""

On Long Island, some are already in the marijuana business in a sense. In a bottom-floor suite in a Plainview office building, the staff of MarijuanaDoctors.com is busy handling telephone calls to doctors and patients in the more than 20 states where medical marijuana is legal, acting as a middleman referral agency and database for those who spot their colorful Internet ads and toll-free number online. Since it began in 2010, the company says some 300 physicians, 500 clinics and 93,000 patients have used its services. Through its website, the firm connects patients with licensed professionals in their area who legally prescribe medical marijuana.

""A doctor basically comes to us, tells us what he's looking for, what type of patients he wants to add to his practice, and we prequalify and screen those patients for him,"" explained the firm's CEO, Jason Draizin, who collects a fee from each participating physician. Many of them deal with patients who suffer from cancer, HIV and other chronic illnesses, and believe marijuana can ease their pain and suffering.

Setting up brand names

Despite the company's name, Draizin insisted, ""I run a computer company,"" which a few years ago began buying up the rights to several domain names related to marijuana -- ""the future brand names of the industry,"" he said — so his firm could capitalize as medical marijuana became legal in some 20 states throughout the nation.

""We think we've successfully created the first brand in the industry,"" said Draizin, who also oversees another website, PotLocator.com, which provides a wide variety of marijuana information, from where to find smoke shops in states where it is legal to more generalized blogs and social media devoted to the topic. Inside the Plainview office, next to staffers on headsets and computers dealing with incoming calls, Draizin keeps a supply shelf full of promotion giveaways, from vaporizers for inhaling marijuana fumes to complimentary caps, socks and even underwear with a marijuana-related logo.

Though his firm doesn't lobby, Draizin said MarijuanaDoctors.com is riding the wave of popular sentiment favoring legalization of marijuana, which he says is ""similar to the original Prohibition"" a century ago when banned alcohol sales were eventually legalized.

Like other entrepreneurs in the marijuana business, Draizin predicts that legalization soon will bring even bigger players into the industry, willing to spend millions for television, radio and other forms of advertisement similar to those now enjoyed by beer, liquor, tobacco and even pharmaceutical companies. ""It grows exponentially,"" he said of the burgeoning pot industry around the nation. ""In the belief of our company, medical marijuana should be a natural form of Bayer aspirin — so what's that worth?""

Petkanas runs his firm from a home address in Huntington and advertises KannaLife Sciences on a website. Currently, its biggest marijuana effort is a research project at a biotech center in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, studying the effect of certain cannabinoids (the chemical compounds in marijuana) on hepatic encephalopathy (brain damage caused by a diseased liver).

Under an exclusive license granted by the National Institutes of Health, KannaLife is seeking to develop drugs from the nonpsychoactive compounds in the cannabinoids (in other words, the stuff in the plant that doesn't make the user high) to help treat patients ""without the adverse side effects associated with smoked marijuana,"" said Renate Myles, chief of NIH's news section. ""It should be noted that the [government approval] is for the use of cannabinoid compounds similar to and including those that naturally occur in marijuana, but not for the whole marijuana plant.""

Financial career goes to pot

While that biotech research is taking place, Petkanas has his eye on making money from other legal uses of marijuana. Right now, he estimates that sales of marijuana — both legal in some states and illegally through the underground market — are between $20 billion and $30 billion annually. In the past two years, his firm has announced various partnerships with other marijuana or hemp-related firms, including one in Colorado looking to develop ""health and wellness"" products.

The marijuana biz is a new venture for Petkanas after a career spent with financial and investment firms. His current website touts his business background, but doesn't mention his previous ""Wolf of Wall Street"" connection or other past difficulties with Wall Street regulators. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records show he agreed to a $4,000 fine in 2004 for a violation while working with another investment firm, without any admission of guilt.

Petkanas pointed out that he left Stratton Oakmont in 1992, well before Jordan Belfort and other Stratton Oakmont officials got into trouble with federal authorities and went to prison. When asked about his ""Wolf of Wall Street"" background, Petkanas said he enjoyed the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. ""As far as Jordan's involvement, I don't think he's going to be involved,"" he said with a smile, recalling their previous relationship.

Joined by Newsday and News 12 Long Island on a recent trip to Denver, Petkanas visited a large grow warehouse and marijuana dispensary operated by Gaia, the same weekend that many in the marijuana business were displaying their wares at the second-annual U.S. Cannabis Cup. Held on the April weekend of 4/20, it was a huge trade show devoted to medical and recreational use, attended by thousands at Denver Merchandise Mart.

At the U.S. Cannabis Cup, both Gaia and Ideal 420 Technologies — the marijuana soil company represented by D'Amato's lobbying firm — had display booths. Other vendors promoted virtually every imaginable use for marijuana, from edibles dipped in chocolate for those who like to eat their marijuana to glass bongs and electric-powered vaporizers for those who like to inhale.

'Technology has advanced'

Many firms such as Ideal 420 Technologies hawked hydroponic watering systems, hot lamps, silver-colored reflecting tents, enriched soils and other equipment needed to grow marijuana, both on a large scale and at home. David Holland, counsel to High Times magazine, which was a host of the event, acknowledged that some of this equipment may wind up eventually being used in places such as New York, where there is a wide underground market for the drug.

""Now technology has advanced with hydroponics and other systems, so you can grow quality plants in a small space like a closet,"" Holland explained. ""So people are growing it partly to eliminate the need to go out there for a streetcorner transaction to procure what they need. And there has certainly been an underground market in it that is not going to go away.""

At Gaia's storefront dispensary in East Denver, customers older than age 21 lined up at glass counters, clearly marked for either medical or recreational use of marijuana, served by ""bud-tenders"" offering various strains of marijuana for sale. With the help of lobbyists and other Albany power brokers, Williams said, Gaia would like to bring similar dispensaries providing marijuana to New York soon. ""A lot of New Yorkers don't understand that there's a wide variety of marijuana flowers and products that are available to help a wide variety of disease conditions,"" he said.

But for future investors, any rush to turn marijuana into gold on Long Island will take some sizable investment, experts say. Most expect the new New York legislation to keep the number of state-approved growers to about five and require an indoor growing operation that would be monitored by video security cameras — all costing a lot of money upfront before any profits are realized. Some say tobacco or alcohol firms may also enter the marijuana market, especially if most U.S. states have legalized it.

""The resources that are used to grow it in a greenhouse environment, especially indoors, are very costly,"" conceded Petkanas. ""So it's a dicey proposition for people who think, 'I'm going to invest in swaths of land and groves, and that the next Philip Morris is going to emerge.' ""

Some LIers ahead of law

Not everyone is willing to wait for the marijuana business to become legal. Many Long Islanders say they use marijuana recreationally or for various ailments — regardless of the criminal risks — and point to great public acceptance of the familiar drug.

On a recent afternoon, inside the Nassau County basement apartment of a friend, Kevin Eastwood, 24, turned on an electric vaporizer, which hummed along as marijuana smoke filled a large clear bag attached to it. Then Eastwood took a big breath, inhaling the light gray vaporized fumes into his lungs with a big smile of satisfaction. Vaporizers are one of many accessories sold in the pot trade.

""Even if people want to call me a criminal, I'm just trying to survive like everyone else,"" explained the Amityville resident. He said smoking weed helps ease his pain from head and other bodily injuries suffered during a 2012 car accident in Seattle that nearly killed him. After months of hospitalization, he now has a polyfiber plate in his skull and 45 titanium screws. Marijuana curbs the ""brainstorming"" — the sometimes painful mental aftereffects of his injury — that is part of his daily life, he said.

""It'll start coming on and I can feel it,"" Eastwood says of his brain pain. ""I get one or two or three of what feels like lightning bolts. And with the medical marijuana, it allows me to help focus on just three or four of those ideas, so I can get through my day and be a contributing human being to society.""

Others are concerned about the 18-month wait for medical marijuana to become regulated under the new law. For months, Missy Miller of Atlantic Beach pushed state lawmakers to approve medical marijuana that she said would help her 14-year-old son Oliver deal more effectively with his frequent epileptic seizures. She's seeking an emergency waiver from the state to allow her son and others with severe conditions to get marijuana as soon as possible. She's worried her son's fragile health may result in him dying before the 18-month wait is over.

""Come to my house. Sit with me, sit with Oliver and watch what he goes through,"" she explains. ""And then you tell me that it shouldn't be available to the sick people who need it.""

Some Long Island-based doctors, like Richard Carleton and Grace Forde, say they've wanted for a long time to prescribe medical marijuana to certain patients, but were afraid of losing their medical license unless it becomes legal.

""I would definitely prescribe it,"" says Forde, who works in Nassau County, a few weeks before the law's passage. ""I had experience with medical marijuana when I trained in California and I found it to be very effective in a lot of chronic pain conditions, as well as neurological conditions. So I would definitely prescribe medical marijuana if it were legal in the state of New York.""

NewsDay,Michaud: My prescription to improve health care,"For those who believe in the Affordable Care Act's promise of more humane coverage for more people, the recent news about drug costs is discouraging.

The most effective drugs for some of the most serious diseases -- cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, mental illness -- can cost individuals who can least afford it thousands of dollars a month in copays. In some cases, desperate people are going without the medicines that could save their lives.

Dr. William Harvey of the American College of Rheumatology recently told this story to a congressional panel: A 30-year-old Wisconsin mom with rheumatoid arthritis cannot afford the best treatment -- known as a biologic -- because of high copays and deductibles.

The woman's hands and feet were deteriorating, becoming stiff and swollen. She was trying to ease the pain with an anti-inflammatory drug, prednisone, but was having trouble caring for her children, and soon she might lose her job.

The medication she needs costs as much as $30,000 a year, and through the ACA, she would be expected to pay up to 60 percent, or $1,500 a month.

People like Harvey are calling on Congress to force health insurers to pay more toward the cost of these drugs through the proposed Patients' Access to Treatments Act. Instead, insurance companies say, drugmakers should lower their prices.

My solution would be some of each.

The government could write stricter rules for insurers. In Florida, four companies in the health exchanges require thousands of dollars in copays from patients with HIV or AIDS. It's a sneaky way to get the sickest people to opt for another insurance company -- a profit-maximizing game insurers have played with Americans for decades, with denials for pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps on coverage. Now, those are gone, thanks to the ACA.

If insurers are allowed to price certain therapies out of reach -- through a complicated system of formularies, tiers and classes -- the practice could spread beyond ACA health care exchanges.

""It's uncharted territory,"" said Wayne Turner, staff attorney for the National Health Law Program, which has filed a formal complaint about Florida's HIV/AIDS coverage. ""The insurance industry has been able to exercise a great deal of discretion"" over drug coverage.

For example, one man emailed recently to say that his friend can't get a specific cancer drug through his private insurance plan because of the cost. These are questions of life and death.

I'm sympathetic to insurers that have been forced to cover vastly more people and offer new benefits. But can we accept them making profits by denying care?

A single multiple sclerosis drug can cost $4,420 a month, or $53,000 a year. A new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi, comes with a price tag of $84,000 for a 12-week cure. To contain expenses, Oregon offers Sovaldi to just one in 10 Medicaid recipients infected with this liver-attacking disease -- the very sickest patients.

Three patients in Arkansas are suing for access to Kalydeco, a cystic fibrosis drug that costs about $300,000 a year.

Many drugmakers offer financial breaks to those who can't afford their medicines, but the programs are limited and require patients to become their own best advocates. That can be asking a lot from someone in a hospital bed.

DENVER — Two decades ago, Dean Petkanas was the chief financial officer of Stratton Oakmont, the Long Island stock firm whose collapse was made famous in the 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Now the Huntington-based entrepreneur is looking to become a big winner in a new risky venture — the business of marijuana. The opportunities for moneymaking range from “edibles,” such as candy infused with marijuana, to a high-tech computer firm looking to link up patients with doctors. “This is an industry that is in its infancy,” explained Petkanas, here to confer with potential partners in Colorado where marijuana is legal, earning millions for investors with both medical and recreational uses. “You’re probably going to have a major gold rush in each state.” Hoping for the same success in New York, Petkanas, head of KannaLife Sciences Inc., and other firms seeking to capitalize on the legalization of marijuana hired top lobbyists — including Park Strategies LLC, the firm owned by former Sen. Alfonse D’Amato, and the Mercury public strategy firm — to persuade state lawmakers in June to end the century-old prohibition on marijuana and make it legal for medicinal purposes.For 17 years in Albany, pro-pot advocacy groups such as NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) had pushed a bill to legalize medical marijuana without any luck. But the arrival of lobbyists and big-money investors in the past two years propelled the idea forward.The new medical marijuana law, signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in July, bans smokable marijuana but allows doctors to prescribe marijuana through oils, vapor and other edible forms in treating patients with cancer, epilepsy and other specific illnesses. The new law won’t take effect for about 18 months, and not until a program is created to select state-approved growers and dispensers of the drug. “This is not a Cheech-and-Chong bill,” said Patrick McCarthy, a former top aide to Gov. George Pataki and now managing director of Mercury, about the state legislation that eventually led to the state’s regulated use of medical marijuana. McCarthy says his firm has advised Petkanas and Gaia Plant-Based Medicine, a large successful Colorado marijuana grower and dispensary firm, looking to start up operations in New York if allowed. “‘Medical marijuana’ was once code for legalization,” but that’s no longer the case, McCarthy contends.While some lobbyists represent growers or packagers, D’Amato’s firm represents “Ideal 420 Technologies,” a firm with offices in New York and New Hampshire that sells a sort of Miracle-Gro for pot. “We have developed the world’s first true marijuana soil,” boasts the company, with a reference in its name to “420,” a common phrase that means “marijuana friendly” among users. “Our soil — a carefully selected blend of vital nutrients and one that only requires watering — grows the highest quality marijuana in the marketplace.” D’Amato, who as a U.S. senator once posed famously for a photo as an undercover cop in the 1980s war on drugs, recently acknowledged he’s had a change of heart. “I know it’s a tough pill to swallow, and if you asked me five years ago if I would ever consider supporting legalizing medical marijuana, I would’ve say, ‘Not a chance,’” wrote D’Amato in a February column in the LI Herald, a local publication. “But times are changing, and marijuana has become a viable form of alternative medicine for those suffering from many debilitating diseases such as ALS, multiple sclerosis, cancer and others. When traditional medicines fail to offer relief, why not give patients alternatives?” Overall, Ideal 420 is prepared to pay D’Amato’s firm as much as $200,000 this year for its lobbying work, said co-founder Richard Yost, who hopes to become a key supplier for medical marijuana in New York. “You have to understand New York politics,” explained Yost about his lobbying effort for the medical marijuana bill. “It’s a Republican issue in the Senate, and Park Strategies has a strong relationship on that side.” The debate about a new marijuana industry for New York — worth potentially as much as $250 million in tax revenue, according to proponents — created a strange set of bedfellows who say they’re happy to be working together. Already in the first six months this year, Park Strategies was paid $90,000 to lobby for Ideal 420, state records show. A spokeswoman for Park Strategies declined to comment. “Business interests are definitely looking at this and hiring lobbyists to work in Albany, primarily around the issue of medical marijuana, because we are a lot closer on that,” said Doug Greene, legislative director for Empire State NORML, which also advocates that recreational use of marijuana (or “nonmedical,” as he prefers) be legalized. “Historically, we are at the point where we are finally having a conversation about the regulation and taxation of marijuana.”Erik A. Williams, a spokesman for Gaia Plant-Based Medicine, said a coalition of business interests, lobbyists and advocacy groups worked to help make marijuana legal in New York for the first time. “The more voices across the board that are involved, then that’s fantastic,” Williams said. “The bottom line on this issue is that it’s nonpartisan. It’s one of the most nonpartisan issues in this country.” In the near future, Williams said he foresees warehouses in Hauppauge or outdoor farms on the East End could be growing marijuana legally. “There’s an absolutely amazing economic boom that can come from this,” he said, walking through a cavernous warehouse facility in suburban Denver where various marijuana plants, at different stages of growth, are cultivated for sale. “Right here in this facility, we employ 60 persons already. What we’ve seen here in Colorado is millions of square feet in retail and warehouse space have been rented. The jobs are incredible. The taxes are incredible.” On Long Island, some are already in the marijuana business in a sense. In a bottom-floor suite in a Plainview office building, the staff of MarijuanaDoctors.com is busy handling telephone calls to doctors and patients in the more than 20 states where medical marijuana is legal, acting as a middleman referral agency and database for those who spot their colorful Internet ads and toll-free number online. Since it began in 2010, the company says some 300 physicians, 500 clinics and 93,000 patients have used its services. Through its website, the firm connects patients with licensed professionals in their area who legally prescribe medical marijuana. “A doctor basically comes to us, tells us what he’s looking for, what type of patients he wants to add to his practice, and we prequalify and screen those patients for him,” explained the firm’s CEO, Jason Draizin, who collects a fee from each participating physician. Many of them deal with patients who suffer from cancer, HIV and other chronic illnesses and believe marijuana can ease their pain and suffering.Despite the company’s name, Draizin insisted, “I run a computer company,” which a few years ago began buying up the rights to several domain names related to marijuana — “the future brand names of the industry,” he said — so his firm could capitalize as medical marijuana became legal in some 20 states throughout the nation. “We think we’ve successfully created the first brand in the industry,” said Draizin, who also oversees another website, PotLocator.com, which provides a wide variety of marijuana information, from where to find smoke shops in states where it is legal to more generalized blogs and social media devoted to the topic. Inside the Plainview office, next to staffers on headsets and computers dealing with incoming calls, Draizin keeps a supply shelf full of promotion giveaways, from vaporizers for inhaling marijuana fumes to complimentary caps, socks and even underwear with a marijuana-related logo. Though his firm doesn’t lobby, Draizin said MarijuanaDoctors.com is riding the wave of popular sentiment favoring legalization of marijuana, which he says is “similar to the original Prohibition” a century ago when banned alcohol sales were eventually legalized. Like other entrepreneurs in the marijuana business, Draizin predicts that legalization soon will bring even bigger players into the industry, willing to spend millions for television, radio and other forms of advertisement similar to those now enjoyed by beer, liquor, tobacco and even pharmaceutical companies. “It grows exponentially,” he said of the burgeoning pot industry around the nation. “In the belief of our company, medical marijuana should be a natural form of Bayer aspirin — so what’s that worth?” Petkanas runs his firm from a home address in Huntington and advertises KannaLife Sciences on a website. Currently, its biggest marijuana effort is a research project at a biotech center in Bucks County, Pa., studying the effect of certain cannabinoids (the chemical compounds in marijuana) on hepatic encephalopathy (brain damage caused by a diseased liver). Under an exclusive license granted by the National Institutes of Health, KannaLife is seeking to develop drugs from the nonpsychoactive compounds in the cannabinoids (in other words, the stuff in the plant that doesn’t make the user high) to help treat patients “without the adverse side effects associated with smoked marijuana,” said Renate Myles, chief of NIH’s news section. “It should be noted that the [government approval] is for the use of cannabinoid compounds similar to and including those that naturally occur in marijuana, but not for the whole marijuana plant.” While that biotech research is taking place, Petkanas has his eye on making money from other legal uses of marijuana. Right now, he estimates that sales of marijuana — both legal in some states and illegally through the underground market — is between $20 billion and $30 billion annually. In the past two years, his firm has announced various partnerships with other marijuana or hemp-related firms, including one in Colorado looking to develop “health and wellness” products. The marijuana biz is a new venture for Petkanas after a career spent with financial and investment firms. His current website touts his business background but doesn’t mention his previous “Wolf of Wall Street” connection or other past difficulties with Wall Street regulators. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records show he agreed to a $4,000 fine in 2004 for a violation while working with another investment firm, without any admission of guilt. Belfort and other Stratton Oakmont officials got into trouble with federal authorities and went to prison. When asked about his “Wolf of Wall Street” background, Petkanas said he enjoyed the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. “As far as Jordan’s involvement [in the marijuana business], I don’t think he’s going to be involved,” he said with a smile, recalling their previous relationship. Joined by Newsday and News 12 Long Island on a recent trip to Denver, Petkanas visited a large grow warehouse and marijuana dispensary operated by Gaia, the same weekend that many in the marijuana business were displaying their wares at the second-annual U.S. Cannabis Cup. Held on the April weekend of 4/20, it was a huge trade show devoted to medical and recreational use attended by thousands at Denver Merchandise Mart.At the U.S. Cannabis Cup, both Gaia and Ideal 420 Technologies — the marijuana soil company represented by D’Amato’s lobbying firm — had display booths. Other vendors promoted virtually every imaginable use for marijuana, from edibles dipped in chocolate for those who like to eat their marijuana to glass bongs and electric powered vaporizers for those who like to inhale. Many firms such as Ideal 420 Technologies hawked hydroponic watering systems, hot lamps, silver-colored reflecting tents, enriched soils and other equipment needed to grow marijuana, both on a large scale and at home. David Holland, counsel to High Times magazine, which was a host of the event, acknowledged that some of this equipment may wind up eventually being used in places such as New York, where there is a wide underground market for the drug. “Now technology has advanced with hydroponics and other systems, so you can grow quality plants in a small space like a closet,” Holland explained. “So people are growing it partly to eliminate the need to go out there for a streetcorner transaction to procure what they need. And there has certainly been an underground market in it that is not going to go away.” At Gaia’s storefront dispensary in East Denver, customers older than age 21 lined up at glass counters, clearly marked for either medical or recreational use of marijuana, served by “bud-tenders” offering various strains of marijuana for sale. With the help of lobbyists and other Albany power brokers, Williams said, Gaia would like to bring similar dispensaries providing marijuana to New York soon. “A lot of New Yorkers don’t understand that there’s a wide variety of marijuana flowers and products that are available to help a wide variety of disease conditions,” he said.But for future investors, any rush to turn marijuana into gold on Long Island will take some sizable investment, experts say. Most expect the new New York legislation to keep the number of state-approved growers to about five and require an indoor growing operation that would be monitored by video security cameras — all costing a lot of money upfront before any profits are realized. Some say tobacco or alcohol firms may also enter the marijuana market, especially if most U.S. states have legalized it. “The resources that are used to grow it in a greenhouse environment, especially indoors, are very costly,” conceded Petkanas. “So it’s a dicey proposition for people who think, ‘I’m going to invest in swaths of land and groves, and that the next Philip Morris is going to emerge.’” Not everyone is willing to wait for the marijuana business to become legal. Many Long Islanders say they use marijuana recreationally or for various ailments — regardless of the criminal risks — and point to great public acceptance of the familiar drug. On a recent afternoon, inside the Nassau County basement apartment of a friend, Kevin Eastwood, 24, turned on an electric vaporizer, which hummed along as marijuana smoke filled a large clear bag attached to it. Then Eastwood took a big breath, inhaling the light gray vaporized fumes into his lungs with a big smile of satisfaction. Vaporizers are one of many accessories sold in the pot trade. “Even if people want to call me a criminal, I’m just trying to survive like everyone else,” explained the Amityville resident. He says smoking weed helps ease his pain from head and other bodily injuries suffered during a 2012 car accident in Seattle that nearly killed him. After months of hospitalization, he now has a polyfiber plate in his skull and 45 titanium screws. Marijuana curbs the “brainstorming” — the sometimes painful mental aftereffects of his injury — that is part of his daily life, he said. “It’ll start coming on and I can feel it,” Eastwood says of his brain pain. “I get one or two or three of what feels like lightning bolts. And with the medical marijuana, it allows me to help focus on just three or four of those ideas, so I can get through my day and be a contributing human being to society.”Others are concerned about the 18-month wait for medical marijuana to become regulated under the new law. For months, Missy Miller of Long Island pushed state lawmakers to approve medical marijuana that she says would help her 14-year-old son Oliver deal more effectively with his frequent epileptic seizures. She’s seeking an emergency waiver from the state to allow her son and others with severe conditions to get marijuana as soon as possible. She’s worried her son’s fragile health may result in him dying before the 18-month wait is over. “Come to my house. Sit with me, sit with Oliver and watch what he goes through,” she explains. “And then you tell me that it shouldn’t be available to the sick people who need it.” Some Long Island-based doctors, like Richard Carleton and Grace Forde, say they’ve wanted for a long time to prescribe medical marijuana to certain patients but were afraid of losing their medical license unless it becomes legal. “I would definitely prescribe it,” says Forde, who works in Nassau County, a few weeks before the law’s passage. “I had experience with medical marijuana when I trained in California and I found it to be very effective in a lot of chronic pain conditions, as well as neurological conditions. So I would definitely prescribe medical marijuana if it were legal in the State of New York.”",25/08/2014
NewsDay,'True Blood' series finale: A muted farewell,"Obviously there was a time when ""True Blood"" was HBO's most important series - a genre-busting exploration of vampires, racism, sex, sin, social taboos and a handful of other topics that weren't specifically vampirical in nature but in some not hard-to-define way, human. Obviously, ""True Blood"" -- which ended Sunday night -- has not approached any where near that stature in recent seasons.

But that doesn't explain Sunday night's muted farewell -- more of a whisper of a full-bore goodbye which was largely ignored by a social media hivemind more focused on what Nicki was or wasn't wearing (VMA's!) than on who Eric Northman was killing or what he was selling... (""New Blood!"")

The reason - I think - is that there could be no completely logical ending, since logic had become optional so long ago... After season one, every subsequent season was a reboot that pushed ""Blood"" further and further away from the rootstock and ultimately from Charlaine Harris' source material, which by Sunday night had become a distant memory too.

And every season reordered the mythology to such an extent that anything could and ultimately would pass for just another insane day in Bon Temps. The show was of course about the core characters (any successful show is), but their lives and worlds had been torn from their moorings so often and with such insane and comical abandon that the show would need the entire seventh and final season just to regain its footing with the most important story of all.

Could a vampire find true love with a human, or in this instance, a faerie? Would anyone care by the end? It's certainly up to hardcore fans to decide whether ""Thank You"" succeeded for them -- the finale title so pointedly directed at them after all - but my hunch is that this wrap probably did not. The logic and story remained shredded, and was only haphazardly reconfigured to service a few beloved characters (Jessica and Hoyt... Hoyt!?) with stories that were out of character or out of time.

Meanwhile, Bill's ending would have been more powerful -- if he had not met even worse ones in prior seasons. We've all been there and seen that. ""Blood"" is over and now we're all left to wonder, what was that ride about anyway?",25/08/2014
NewsDay,Depression and its many possible causes,"Dear Pharmacist: I am saddened by the suicide of Robin Williams. I've dealt with depression on and off for years, and I was wondering if you have any natural suggestions for me to ask my doctor about. -- L.C., Gainesville, Florida

When I hear a person say they've battled depression on and off for a long period of time, I ask the question why it is on and off? Something you are eating, doing or taking is impacting you so much so that your mood is affected. Hormone imbalances are frequently the problem, especially estrogen and testosterone. Thyroid hormone is my specialty, and if it drops too low, you get depressed. When it moves into a healthy range, you feel happy and content. When I say ""normal range,"" I don't mean the normal reference range indicated on your lab test. My opinion is that the so-called normal range is based upon a sick and hypothyroid population. This may explain why you feel terrible but your levels are ""normal."" I don't go by labs, I go by clinical presentation.

I adored Robin Williams; he was brilliant, and behind his smiling eyes and hysterical jokes, he battled depression for years. You may feel the same way as you read this today, and I am glad you're still holding on. Depression is one of those conditions that people often judge. Here are some reasons for depression that you might explore with the help of your physician:

Hypothyroidism and hypoadrenia: I've mentioned this one already; however, I want you to get a copy of my ""Thyroid Healthy"" book so you learn how to test properly. Testing and treatment is the key to your happiness. Also, do not take thyroid medicine until your adrenal glands are strong and healthy. You may need to be supported adaptogenic herbs, a healthy diet, relaxation and other stress reducers.

The pill: Synthetic hormones for birth control or menopause reduce your body's levels of B vitamins and minerals to the point where you cannot manufacture happy brain chemicals. A reduction in key neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin causes depression, which causes the ""on and off"" situation you describe.

Statins and binders: We know these drugs reduce CoQ10, but do you know they reduce your ability to activate vitamin D? Ever heard of seasonal affective disorder (SAD)? That is often related to low vitamin D levels, so you might need to take a vitamin D supplement if you take cholesterol reducers.

Medications: Drugs rob the body of life-sustaining nutrients. Ibuprofen steals folic acid; diabetic drugs steal B12. Read my ""Drug Muggers"" book for more drug-induced nutrient depletions. If you take medications periodically, you can't make neurotransmitters, which leads to the ""on and off"" feeling.

Infections: Certain infections in the body can affect the brain. You can suffer bipolar disorder, depression, insomnia and/or anxiety because of Bartonella, Lyme, syphilis, HIV, fungal infections (and their mycotoxins), herpes and many other diseases. Clearing the infection improves mood better than any prescribed antidepressant.",16/08/2014
NewsDay,Los Angeles Clippers sale to Steve Ballmer made official,"LOS ANGELES - The Clippers moved on from months of ugliness Tuesday, with Steve Ballmer officially becoming the team's new owner in a record $2 billion sale that ousted Donald Sterling as the NBA's longest-tenured owner.

Sterling bought the team in 1981 for $12 million and presided over decades of losing seasons before engaging in a fierce legal battle with his estranged wife to hold on to his most prized asset.

The team said the sale closed after a Los Angeles court confirmed the authority of Shelly Sterling, on behalf of the Sterling Family Trust, to sell the franchise to the former Microsoft CEO.

The NBA Board of Governors had previously approved the sale.

""Really excited -- in a pretty hardcore way -- to continue the path to making the Clippers a better and better basketball team, and a better and better citizen of the Los Angeles community,"" Ballmer told The Associated Press in a phone interview.

The bizarre drama began in April when a recording surfaced of Donald Sterling scolding his girlfriend for bringing black men to Clippers games. The audio spurred the NBA to ban Sterling for life and fine him $2.5 million.

Sterling was apologetic after the audio recording went viral, but his mea culpa backfired when he criticized Lakers great Magic Johnson, who had been photographed with Sterling's girlfriend, as a bad role model for kids because he had HIV. The 80-year-old real estate mogul was roundly condemned from locker rooms to the Oval Office, where President Barack Obama called Sterling's remarks ""incredibly offensive racist statements.""

With the NBA threatening to seize the team and auction it, Sterling initially gave his wife of 58 years permission to negotiate a sale but then refused to sign the Ballmer deal. He said he would sue the league instead and then revoked the trust, which his lawyers said effectively killed the deal.

Shelly Sterling removed Donald as a trustee after doctors found he had symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

Adam Streisand, Ballmer's attorney, said Tuesday that Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas signed the order authorizing the sale even if Donald Sterling's attorneys filed an appeal.

He said even if Donald Sterling seeks an emergency order directing the judge to vacate his order, the attorney is confident an appellate court would agree that Levanas made the correct decision.

Donald Sterling's attorneys weren't immediately available to comment.

The sale ends some troubling concerns that had surrounded the team in recent months.

Doc Rivers would possibly have quit as coach if Sterling remained the owner, interim CEO Richard Parsons had testified. All-Star point guard Chris Paul, who also is president of the Players Association, might have sat out and convinced other players to join him. Sponsors who already started to flee after the Donald Sterling recording was released might have stayed away for good.

None of that appears to be a problem with Ballmer taking over what could be a powerhouse team next season. By agreeing to the record purchase price, he's already proven he's willing to spend in contrast to the famously frugal Sterling, long regarded as the worst owner in the NBA.

""The topic of conversation with Doc earlier was to focus in on what does it take and how can I help support him in achieving our mutual mission and in a pretty intense way continue to improve, be tenacious,"" Ballmer said. ""If we do all that, good things will come our way.""

Ballmer was nearly an NBA owner last year before owners chose to keep the Kings in Sacramento, rather than allow them to be sold to a group that included Ballmer and moved to Seattle.

Now he's got his own team to share with his wife and three sons.

""We're a family that likes basketball,"" he told the AP.

Ballmer said he fell in love with the sport as a seventh-grader in his hometown of Detroit. He was manager of his high school team, which included keeping statistics.

Two of his sons have played the game, while the youngest has been a statistician for his high school team in the Seattle area, where the family lives.

Ballmer said he hopes to attend a lot of Clippers games next season. He said Parsons has agreed to stay on as CEO for the interim.

""That gives me a chance to figure this all out,"" he said.

Ballmer wants to put the controversy in the past and focus the team on being ""a great citizen in the community for a diverse set of folks,"" including the NBA's predominantly black players.

""We're going to do our best on that,"" he said. ""I know that is high on Doc's list, it's high on my list to do that. We also have to be a phenomenal basketball team, play really well as a team and have great success on court. We're going to work on all those things.""

Ballmer agreed to give Shelly Sterling the title of ""owner emeritus.""

""I am confident that Steve will bring the city a championship team in the very near future,"" she said.",12/08/2014
NewsDay,Chembio reports narrowed losses for quarter,"Chembio Diagnostics Inc. narrowed its losses in the April-June period as sales increased of its tests for HIV and syphilis.

The Medford-based manufacturer reported Thursday a loss of $146,000 in the second quarter compared with a loss of $241,000 for the same time a year ago.

Sales climbed 38 percent to $7.4 million, including a significant gain in orders from Brazil.

Chief executive John J. Sperzel III said Chembio had successfully established its own U.S. sales force and expanded production. He also said it would further increase sales to foreign countries where demand is high for tests for infectious diseases.

Sperzel said the company may branch out from HIV and syphilis testing: ""Our leadership team is actively evaluating opportunities for new product development and strategic partnerships beyond infectious disease.""

Chembio released its earnings before Thursday's stock market opening. The company's shares rose 19 cents, or nearly 6 percent, to $3.45 in Nasdaq trading.

NewsDay,Obama hosts Africa summit with eye on legacy,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is gathering nearly 50 African heads of state in Washington for an unprecedented summit aimed in part at building his legacy on a continent where his commitment has been questioned.

But the backdrop for the conference that begins tomorrow underscores what has been a constant challenge to that effort. Even as Obama immerses himself in talks on regional security, democracy building and business investment in Africa, the world's attention -- and much of his own -- will be on an extraordinary array of urgent overseas crises.

Among them: Gaza, Russia's provocations in Ukraine and mounting extremism in Iraq, to name just a few. An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa also threatens to cast a shadow over the summit, with leaders from at least two affected countries canceling plans to travel to Washington and the United States setting up medical screenings for other officials arriving from those nations.

""It's the nature of the world we live in today where there are multiple crises at any time,"" said Witney Schneidman, the former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ""But that should not paralyze us from moving forward on key areas to advance our interests.""

White House officials say the American interests in Africa are immense. The continent is home to some of the world's fastest growing economies and a rapidly expanding middle class. The United States is also competing for those consumers with China, which surpassed the United States in 2009 as Africa's largest trading partner.

""The importance of this for America needs to be understood,"" Obama said Friday. ""Africa is growing, and you've got thriving markets and you've got entrepreneurs and extraordinary talent among the people there.""

He added: ""Africa also happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular, and people feel a real affinity for our way of life.""

From the start of his presidency, Obama has faced sky-high expectations from African leaders and U.S. policymakers who hoped the son of a Kenyan would bump Africa up the White House list of foreign policy priorities.

Obama's first trip to sub-Saharan Africa as president -- an overnight stop in Ghana in 2009 -- also suggested that he could be an American president able to tell hard truths to the continent's leaders. During a speech to parliament in Accra, he declared that Africa ""doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.""

But it would be four years before Obama returned to Africa again. Unlike his predecessor George W. Bush, who launched a $15 billion program to address HIV and AIDS, Obama seemed to be lacking a signature Africa initiative.

Analysts say Obama's second term has brought about a more robust focus on Africa. The president made a three-country trip to the continent last summer and aides say he's likely to travel there again before the end of his second term. He's also launched a new ""Power Africa"" initiative that aims to leverage billions in private-sector commitments to bring electricity to 20 million households in sub-Saharan Africa.

Carl LeVan, a professor at American University's School of International Service, said those efforts, along with the Washington summit, suggest an administration undertaking ""a concerted and calculated effort to construct its legacy, and its legacy toward Africa in particular, since expectations were so high.""",02/08/2014
NewsDay,Editorial: Can the AIDS-HIV epidemic end?,"More than three decades after the AIDS pandemic swept into New York and the nation to claim hundreds of thousands of lives, an amazing moment has arrived.

For the first time, a pill is available that can prevent transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, during sex.

Its name is Truvada -- and it's a key ingredient in the daily cocktail that has prolonged the lives of many who have already contracted the virus.

The startling news is that when those who are not infected take the pill once a day, Truvada has proved more than 90 percent effective in blocking the transmission of HIV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. The CDC issued guidelines in May for using the drug to prevent HIV infections.

Seizing this moment, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recently announced a plan to use Truvada as a part of his strategy to cut new HIV infections statewide from 3,000 a year to 750 by 2020.

It's an ambitious, trailblazing plan -- and reaching the target will take an unflagging, collaborative effort.

But if that push can be accomplished successfully, officials say, the number of New Yorkers living with HIV would be reduced for the first time since the first cases were diagnosed in 1981.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Great strides have been made. In New York and the nation, HIV transmission via blood transfusions and from mother to child have been virtually eliminated, and new infections due to intravenous drug use have been dramatically reduced. With the success of antiretroviral drugs in treating HIV, the infection is no longer a death sentence. But there is no cure or vaccine. And the CDC estimates that nationally there are still 50,000 new infections a year.

New York, long the epicenter of the crisis, has a shot to become the first state to reduce AIDS to less than epidemic proportions by driving the number of new infections below the number of HIV-related deaths. It's an opportunity that shouldn't be missed.

Besides Truvada, other factors have helped fuel optimism among public health officials. Since 2010, doctors in New York are required to offer HIV testing to all patients ages 13 to 64. Since April, written authorization for the testing is no longer required. Verbal consent is enough. Doctors and health officials can now share information to find patients who drop out of treatment. And the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover HIV screening with no out-of-pocket cost for policyholders.

The state's plan includes identifying an estimated 22,000 people who are HIV positive but don't know it, and ensuring that the 64,000 people who know they're HIV positive but aren't in treatment get anti-HIV therapy. And it involves securing access to Truvada, a pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, for HIV-negative adults at high risk -- for example, men and women with HIV-positive partners, or who have sex with multiple partners.

The state has committed $5 million to the plan this year. The objective is to educate doctors about PrEP, and to push them to consistently offer testing. For the initiative to work, officials must communicate that this is an opportunity for an extraordinary public health triumph.

Advocacy groups have been enlisted to reach at-risk people in places such as bars and clubs, where peer-to-peer conversations are the best way to spread the word about PrEP, and address unfounded concerns about side effects, which are minimal.

Medicaid and most private insurance plans cover the $1,300-a-month cost of the drug. And Gilead Sciences Inc., the California-based company that makes Truvada, has an assistance program to defray the cost if needed.

The state's bill for HIV medication will likely grow before savings from averted infections are realized. And there is a risk that the availability of PrEP could usher in a return to unsafe sex -- despite warnings that PrEP is not intended to replace prevention tools such as condoms.

But this is an opportunity to end the AIDS epidemic in New York, which not so long ago seemed an impossible dream.

This editorial has been updated to correct the cost of Truvada. Treatment is $1,300 a month. An incorrect amount appeared in an earlier version of this editorial.",02/08/2014

HUNTINGTON

Smoking ban focus of public hearing

The Huntington Town board has scheduled a public hearing at 7 p.m. Aug. 19 to discuss banning smoking at the town’s eight beaches.

Town officials cite public health, medical research and published studies as part of the their desire to protect the health and welfare of those who use the town’s beaches. Currently, smoking is banned in town playgrounds, officials said.

“People have a right to be free from secondhand smoke whether they are in a restaurant, airplane or on a beach blanket,” said town board member Mark Cuthbertson, sponsor of the hearing resolution.

He said the measure would exempt parking lots. Criticism about the law going too far is not warranted, he said.

“Some would argue that it does not go far enough and would criticize us for allowing smoking in the parking lots,” Cuthbertson said. “This strikes a balance by allowing smoking at the facility but not forcing you to move your beach blanket because the people near you are lighting up.” — DEBORAH S.

BROOKHAVEN TOWN

Roadwork will cost $2M more, town says

Brookhaven will spend $2 million more than anticipated to repair and rebuild municipal roads.

The town board last week unanimously amended a bond resolution to increase from $14.5 million to $16.5 million the amount needed to widen reconstruct or resurface various roads.

District 3 Town Councilman Kevin LaValle sponsored the resolution and said the funds to fix up the roads came from canceled bonded projects.

“The roads are improving every day,” said LaValle, representing communities such as Lake Grove, Centereach and Selden. “With the resources we have, we have to continue improving them.”

The original bond resolution was adopted in December. Last week’s measure was approved in a 7-0 vote. — DEON J. HAMPTON

BRENTWOOD

Town encourages summer recreation

Brentwood residents are encouraged to sign up for summer activities that the Town of Islip has developed as an alternative to the closed Roberto Clemente Park.

The town is urging residents to take advantage of programs such as basketball, arts and crafts, and transportation at the town’s other parks.

Registration is underway at the Brentwood Recreation Center at 99 Third Ave.

Clemente Park was closed indefinitely in April after the discovery of thousands of tons of toxic debris found dumped inside the park. The Suffolk County district attorney’s office is investigating the dumping there and at three other town sites.

The recreation programs include free transportation to sites such as the Bay Shore Marina spray park and the Casamento Pool in West Islip, according to the town. Brentwood residents are eligible for reduced rates to the facilities as well as free indoor pool recreation at Brentwood High School.

For more information, call the town’s Parks and Recreation Department at 631-224-5404 or visit www.townofislip-ny.gov. — SOPHIA CHANG

NORTHPORT

Event to offer help for veterans in need

The Northport Veterans Affair Medical Center is hosting an event next month that will provide veterans who are homeless, or those at risk of becoming so, an opportunity to sit down with several social service agencies to talk about what’s available at the VA and in surrounding areas.

The event, “Stand Down,” will include more than 55 agencies that provide such services as housing, legal, dental, education, substance abuse and mental health needs, according to a VA statement.

The event is Sept. 24, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., at the VA Medical Center’s gymnasium. This is the biannual event’s fifth year.

“Our hearts break at the thought of an individual who served our country being homeless or at risk for becoming homeless,” said Philip Moschitta, director of the VA Medical Center, in a statement.

“Getting those individuals connected with all the services we offer here at Northport VAMC as well as the many resources available through our community partners is a good way to work toward ending veteran homelessness,” Moschitta said.

The event will also promote local food banks, HIV/AIDS awareness, Red Cross support and health/nutrition services.

Attendees will also have access to lunch, haircuts, personal hygiene products and other pantry items. — MACKENZIE ISSLER

HUNTINGTON

Animal shelter seeks food, other supplies

A pet supplies drive to benefit Little Shelter Animal Adoption Center in Huntington is underway.

The shelter needs pet food, cat and dog toys, kitty litter, cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, paper towels, garbage cans and bags, AA batteries, bedding and pet treats, officials said.

Little Shelter, established in 1927, is one of Long Island’s oldest no-kill animal shelters. It provides medical care and rehabilitation, and a spay and neuter program, as well as adoption services.

Arleen Leone, special programs manager at the shelter, said the facility is still recovering from superstorm Sandy’s impact.

“We are a nonprofit that is maintained entirely through donations raised from the community,” Leone said. “Anything that the community can bring that we don’t have to buy helps because the monetary donations then go to the animals’ medical care, which is where we spend the most money.”

Donations can be made at the shelter, 33 Warner Rd. in Huntington, Monday through Friday from 1 to 7 p.m., and on weekends from noon to 5 p.m. For more information about the shelter and its services, or to adopt a pet, call 631-368-8770. — DEBORAH S. MORRIS

PORT JEFFERSON

Town OKs contract for emergency alerts

Port Jefferson residents soon will be able to receive emergency alerts and other information about events occurring in the village.

The Village Board on Monday agreed to a contract with Emergency Communications Network, of Ormond Beach, Florida, to install the company’s Code Red emergency alert system. The contract is worth about $3,600 annually.

Residents who sign up for the service on the village website, portjeff.com, will be able to receive alerts via phone, email and text messages. Alerts will notify residents about storms, police activity and road closures.

The alert system may be available later this week, village officials said.

Code Red also is used by the Town of Huntington, the Village of Amityville and Suffolk County Fire, Rescue and Emergency Services.

In other business, the village board approved a $99,886 contract to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system at Village Hall.

The board also approved a $4,900 contract to repair the roof of a Department of Public Works building at 88 North Country Rd. — CARL MACGOWAN",23/07/2014
NewsDay,'Coach' in the Morning show: Lukas jokes about Will Take Charge's fine workout at Saratoga,"SARATOGA SPRINGS - If you want to see most of the country's best horses, check out Saratoga's workouts. Among the stars spending the summer at the Spa are two-time defending Horse of the Year Wise Dan; the early favorite to dethrone him, Palace Malice; Belmont Stakes hero Tonalist, and last year's Travers winner, Will Take Charge.

D. Wayne Lukas sent out Will Take Charge for a 5-furlong breeze on the training track Monday at 5:30 a.m., about two hours after the 78-year-old trainer usually gets out of bed. The time was 1:01.02, a solid move in preparation for facing Palace Malice in the $1.5-million Whitney Handicap here Aug. 2.

The Coach can be most entertaining, and he was in rare form joking about the work. He goofed on ""trainerspeak,"" in which the default comment always has been ""Perfect, just what I wanted.""

""He looked good,"" Lukas said. ""Actually, he was three-legged lame. He didn't eat up last night. He's got a temperature. And I think he's got the hives, but I think I'm going to run him.""

Obstacle course

Saratoga will showcase steeplechase racing in the first race Wednesday and Thursday, with post time at 12:25 p.m., 35 minutes earlier than usual. The jumpers are tremendously popular on the other side of the Atlantic, with England's Cheltenham Festival in mid-March the highlight. In Ireland, steeplechasers are even more popular than flat runners. The slogan over there is, ""Flat racing for the head, jump racing for the heart.""

Over here, most handicappers lack enthusiasm for steeplechasing because they are nervous about betting on animals that must leave the ground and land on the other side of obstacles. Jump races are surprisingly formful, but many bettors wouldn't think of playing them.

Bluegrass Summer, trained by 73-year-old jumps genius Jonathan Sheppard, tops a field of 10 for Thursday's 2 1/16-mile Jonathan Kiser Novice Steeplechase. He could extend Hall of Famer Sheppard's record streak of winning at least one race, flat or jump, at Saratoga to an amazing 46 years.

Upset in feature

Even on a quiet Monday, two 5-year-old millionaires, My Miss Aurelia and Grace Hall, ran at Saratoga. Neither won, though, with Better Lucky ($12.20) coming from far back under Javier Castellano to take the 7-furlong, $100,000 Shine Again Stakes for fillies and mares.

Better Lucky, the longest price in a field of four, surged in the final 100 yards to beat Grace Hall by a head, with Miss Aurelia half a length behind her and a length in front of pacesetter Bridgehampton.

My Miss Aurelia was making her first start for trainer Todd Pletcher and coming off a 16-month layoff. She was 6-for-9 for Steve Asmussen, winning her first six races before running second behind Royal Delta in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic.

Grace Hall has lost six in a row but has been second in all three of her starts for trainer Bill Mott. She was 6-for-13 in Tony Dutrow's barn.",21/07/2014
NewsDay,"Adam Lambert, with Queen, shines under pressure","This shouldn't work. In fact, there was a moment in the middle of the Queen + Adam Lambert show at Madison Square Garden Thursday night when it seemed like it might not.

It came when guitarist Brian May was essentially leading a sing-along of ""Love of My Life,"" with the audience taking up the parts of the late Freddie Mercury. Then, a video of Mercury completing the song was shown, bringing the crowd to its feet and May to tears.

Why exactly did they need Lambert again?

After all, up to that point the former ""American Idol"" runner-up and current ""Glee"" star had proved to be a good study, but not necessarily ready to front the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band. Leading the crowd in a chant of ""Bite It!"" during ""Another One Bites the Dust"" didn't exactly help.

Later, however, after the halfway point, Lambert started to grow into the role. He handled ""Under Pressure"" gloriously, with drummer Roger Taylor taking on David Bowie's vocals nicely. He followed with a poignant version of ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" that showed he could interpret a song differently from Mercury with his powerful voice.

The way he went toe-to-toe vocally with a video of Mercury during ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" though, showed that Queen had made a good choice in signing him up.

Can Lambert really replace Mercury, who died of HIV-related complications in 1991? Of course not. But he may be able to help take the band in a new direction.",18/07/2014
NewsDay,Queen + Adam Lambert = Odd night at The Garden,"Queen guitarist Brian May asked the question everyone at Madison Square Garden Thursday night was asking: “What do you think of the new lineup?”

He was hoping for a big response, considering Queen + Adam Lambert had just completed a rousing version of “Under Pressure,” with drummer Roger Taylor handling David Bowie’s vocals on the classic. And he got one, sort of, though, if we’re being honest, it was nothing compared to the reaction the video of the late Freddie Mercury singing “Love of My Life” got only minutes earlier.

That only underscored what this tour -- one of the biggest of the summer so far -- really is. “After all these years, you gave us the chance to come here and be rock gods again,” May said, which was actually refreshingly honest. What exactly are May and Taylor supposed to do without Mercury, who died in 1991 of HIV-related complications? Simply sit at home and count their money?

They enjoy performing and they’re still pretty great at it, as May’s lengthy, stylistically far-flung guitar solo showed.

Lambert is no Freddie Mercury. He has a booming voice, but nowhere near the range of the legendary frontman. And, in the position he’s accepted, he has even less chance to shine, singing beloved classics that other people wrote that he connects to with varying success.

He tries to revive some of Mercury’s campiness, especially on “Killer Queen,” which he delivered reclined on a couch. However, Mercury’s campiness was combined with swagger and cool that all came naturally to him.

Lambert is putting on an act. None of this is natural and how could it be? What makes it even tougher to believe is how nice Lambert is about it. He’s nothing but deferential to the legendary May and Taylor, as he should be. And his reverence for Mercury is obvious, especially when he sings with a video of Mercury during “Bohemian Rhapsody.”

That doesn’t make Lambert very rock ‘n’ roll. It makes him a nice guy. In fact, the whole tour seems like a bunch of nice people in a bad situation trying to do the best they can.

The result is a nice evening of Queen songs that simply makes it clear how great Mercury really was.

NewsDay,Beekeeper has honey of a deal with East End farmers,"On a bright, breezy April Sunday, beekeeper Robin Blackley has discovered an invader amid her beehives.

""There's a wasp,"" says Blackley, 62, of Southampton. It's been making a nest in her apiary, or bee yard, and needs to be terminated.

Blackley, who has been a beekeeper for 25 years, crouches down and uses her bare fingers to pick up the critter by its wings. ""Wasps are carnivorous and will kill and eat honey bees,"" she says.

She steps on the wasp, then returns to her day's task, transferring a 3-pound package of new honey bees to one of the rows of hives she keeps on this East End organic farm.

As Blackley works, bees circle around her head and land on the arms of her blue workshirt. Like others in her trade, Blackley wears a protective bee helmet and a veil. However, she doesn't wear gloves. Working barehanded ""gives me a better feel for what I'm doing,"" she says. ""I work with apis mellifera, which is basically the honey bee.""

Unlike the similarly colored yellow jackets, which are a kind of wasp, honey bees ""are not aggressive unless disturbed."" Nevertheless, exercising caution, Blackley pumps a bellows connected to a stainless-steel smoker. The sweet-smelling smoke from smoldering pine needles and dried leaves distracts the bees from attacking the intruder.

What her bees pollinate

Best Bets Get the scoop on events, nightlife, day trips, family fun and things to do on Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

You may not have observed Blackley toiling in the farm fields on the East End, but if you've purchased produce or honey from a farm stand, you've probably seen the result of her work. Her bees pollinate apple orchards, pumpkin and strawberry patches and organic vegetable fields on about 10 farms from Jamesport to Amagansett.

Products gleaned from her hives are sold through her website, eastendapiaries.com, at farm stands or personally by Blackley in farmers markets throughout the South Fork.

She says it's not a lucrative career, nor without other challenges. Freezing winters, parasites, pesticides and something called Colony Collapse Disorder threaten her bees and consequently her livelihood as a beekeeper.

Blackley's work year begins in March, when she checks the hives to make sure there's enough bee food (bees eat honey and pollen, or a special sugar water she makes). It's a full-time job from April or May, depending on the weather (bees don't fly unless air temperature is above 50 degrees), through late autumn.

East End farmers appreciate her efforts. ""There are very few people that are willing to take the time and energy that is required in beekeeping,"" says Amy Halsey, a member of the East End farming family that owns The Milk Pail, a fresh market on the Bridgehampton-Water Mill border. Blackley's bees pollinate the apple, pumpkin and peach crops at The Milk Pail's Bridgehampton orchard. ""Without bees, we don't have most of what we eat,"" says Halsey, who has a degree in horticulture from SUNY Cobleskill. Sold in glass containers, Blackley's raw honey flies off the shelves at the market, says Halsey.

Blackley didn't grow up dreaming of life as a beekeeper. Quite the opposite. ""I was always afraid of bees,"" she says. As a young girl, she'd been stung by a hornet; she didn't know the difference between bees and the more aggressive stinging insects.

She wanted to become an artist after graduating from Walt Whitman High School in Huntington Station. So, Blackley studied lost-wax casting at Arizona State University in Tempe, and eventually worked in commercial foundries in Manhattan.

""My transformation came about when I had left Manhattan to open up a restaurant on the Outer Banks of North Carolina,"" she says. The plan didn't pan out, so an unemployed Blackley went to live with her parents in Southampton, where she'd spent summers as a girl.

She planted a garden and began to notice the bees that visited to pollinate the vegetables and melons. ""My only thought was I better not make a move because I don't want to get stung, and then I realized that they could care less about me,"" she says. ""The only thing in their little bee brain was to gather the nectar and the pollen from these flowers and head straight back to the hive.""

Cured of bee phobia, she began to learn from other beekeepers, take courses and eventually joined the Long Island Beekeepers Club. In 1987, she formed East End Apiaries, her beekeeping business in Southampton. Early on, she took occasional breaks to raise her two sons, who are now grown. Matthew, 31, is an organic beer brewer in Portland, Oregon, and Adam, 26, is a sail maker at North Sails near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

Honey's her end of the deal

Blackley, who is separated from her husband, says she has about 40 hives, or colonies, though her income isn't generated from the all-important pollination process. Blackley doesn't charge pollination fees to farmers; that's a free service she provides in exchange for keeping the bees on their property. Her income is derived from selling honey and honey products.

The honey won't be extracted for the once-a-year harvest until sometime this month. ""When I first started keeping bees, you would get a tremendous honey flow; now the honey flow has tapered off,"" she says. Each hive produces about 180 pounds of honey.

Colonies regularly die out and have to be replaced with new bees, she says. One colony died of starvation last winter when the bees stopped eating to cluster around their queen to keep her warm -- providing a core that can reach 92 degrees. ""It was so cold that they couldn't break cluster,"" Blackley says.

Others succumb to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder, which affects bees throughout the United States. ""Your hives will look fine and you'll come back two weeks later and there are no bees,"" she explains.

With warmer weather, Blackley is back, making a home for a new queen bee she's obtained from a breeder. She works efficiently and barely reacts when she's stung by a bee. Using a corkscrew, she pulls the stopper from the small box that holds the new queen, the bee upon which the whole enterprise rests.

As the queen releases pheromones, a chemical substance that makes the bees react instinctively, they fan their wings. Each worker -- all females, Blackley notes -- will produce one-twelfth of a teaspoon of honey in its brief, six-week life (queen bees can live for years). However, only one queen bee lays the eggs that can swell the population of the hive up to 60,000 bees by summer.

""That's all it takes,"" Blackley says, ""just the right woman.""

NewsDay,CDC launches new anti-smoking ads,"Long Island’s many existing smoking cessation programs might soon get a slew of calls from smokers attempting to quit. So they hope, at least.



The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recently announced a new set of anti-smoking ads -- several more in the style of “Tips from a Former Smoker” -- which began airing on TV and radio on Monday, as well as appearing in newspapers and magazines, on billboards and online. The new bunch features gum disease and tooth loss as well as smoking’s impact on pregnancy, babies, and people with HIV.



“There’s definitely an uptick of people calling to make cessation attempts whenever any of those ads run,” says Dan Jacobsen, a nurse practitioner with North Shore-LIJ's Center for Tobacco Control, “between our class and the New York State Smokers Quitline.”



For those who want to quit, there are several options around Long Island.

For example, North Shore-LIJ runs free smoking cessation classes several times a year as well as a weekly support group for quitters who have completed their six-week series. Suffolk County runs a “Learn to Be … Tobacco Free” program that also offers cessation classes at no cost.

County Executive Steve Bellone and County Commissioner of Health Services, Dr. James Tomarken, issued an announcement last week that pointed residents toward the program’s resources in advance of the CDC’s upcoming campaign.



“The ads will bring to life the devastating effects of smoking,” said Tomarken in the announcement, posted on the county website. “We anticipate that the ads will encourage smokers to want to prevent these realities from happening to them. We’ve got a program for that.”



But you never know what will help push someone to try quitting, says Rhoda Nichter, who leads cessation classes at St. Francis Hospital DeMatteis Center. “Someone might see a real scary ad, with someone who had their larynx removed,” she says, and that will help them. Or, they might “turn it off and never want to think about it.”



“People think, ‘Oh, no one smokes anymore,’” Jacobsen says. But that’s not true. When North Shore LIJ announced the new grant in April, there were an estimated 367,000 adult smokers on Long Island.



“We haven’t beaten this,” Jacobsen says. “It’s still a big issue.”



Coinciding with the new ads, the North Shore-LIJ Health System begins receiving a five year grant this month for its Center for Tobacco Control. The $1.5 million grant does not go toward funding for cessation classes, which will continue separately. Instead, it will target institutions and major health care systems to change policies at the top.



The grant will also “help Long Island’s most vulnerable populations to quit smoking,” according to the April announcement, including those living under the poverty line or with mental illness. The Center for Tobacco Control will partner with Federally Qualified Health Centers that serve low-income Medicaid patients as well as with mental health facilities, Jacobsen says, “to finally have an impact on those ... that still smoke in high numbers.”



And as hospitals and other systems make the transition from paper charts to electronic medical record (EMRs), Jacobsen explains, it’s an opportunity to incorporate questions about smoking and conversations about quitting into standard practice.



“If we can get it in the policy that every patient who comes through the door gets the same treatment,” Jacobsen says, “I think we’ll have a much bigger impact.”



As for smokers who see the CDC’s new ads, or are otherwise stirred to quit, there are plenty of options for smoking cessation classes on Long Island, many of them free.



“Smoking is so bad for you, you should pull out all the stops,” says Mara Bernstein, a tobacco cessation specialist at Winthrop-University Hospital’s Wellness Pavilion, where new classes begin every month. “Keep trying until you beat that horrible habit.”",09/07/2014
NewsDay,"Opinion: Don't be fooled, the Roberts Court isn't a conservative one","WASHINGTON - The Roberts Court certainly seems like a conservative juggernaut.

And, yes, from campaign finance to race to religion, it has moved the law dramatically to the right. But last week's Supreme Court decision on cell-phone privacy shows that this isn't the entire story. In a number of significant areas of law, a majority of the Roberts Court will line up behind rulings that are not so much conservative as libertarian, often with a surprisingly progressive bent.

That is certainly true of Riley v. California, in which Chief Justice John Roberts, on behalf of his unanimous colleagues, concluded this week that police may generally not search an arrestee's cell phone without due process.

""Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple - get a warrant,"" wrote the chief justice.

This finding echoes arguments about the Constitution's text and history made by both liberal organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Constitutional Accountability Center, and the libertarian Cato Institute.

And it's only the latest case in which the court's relatively liberal justices have peeled off one of the court's conservatives - most often Justice Anthony Kennedy, who leans libertarian on many issues, or Justice Antonin Scalia, whose originalism sometimes leads him to expansive readings of the protections provided by the Bill of Rights - to craft a majority in favor of a libertarian-liberal outcome.

Consider, for example, Safford v. Redding, a 2009 case in which liberal and libertarian organizations successfully argued that the strip search of a schoolgirl violated the Fourth Amendment. Or United States v. Jones, a 2012 case in which the same coalition convinced the court that attaching a GPS tracking device to a car to monitor its location violates the Fourth Amendment.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The court's libertarian-liberal decisions are not limited to traditional search cases.

For example, in Boumediene v. Bush in 2008, a five-justice majority held that the constitutional protection of habeas corpus extended to the detainees held at Guantanamo, reaching a result urged by both liberals and libertarians. Last year in United States v. Windsor, the court held 5-4 that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage to be solely between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law, violated the basic constitutional requirement of equality under the law. The decision at once struck a blow against government regulation of people's private lives (a triumph for libertarians) and against discrimination and inequality (a triumph for liberals).

In another case, Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International Inc., liberal and libertarian groups urged the court to hold that the government could not require nongovernmental organizations that wanted to receive federal funding for HIV and AIDS programs overseas to adopt a policy explicitly opposing prostitution. The court agreed in a 6-2 decision.

So if the reliably conservative Roberts Court isn't so reliable across an important range of issues, what might we might expect in the years ahead?

Three major issues working their way through the lower courts could produce more liberal-libertarian results when the justices hear them. The first is same-sex marriage. Last year when the Court struck down DOMA's Section 3, it declined to decide whether similar state laws are also unconstitutional. So now courts across the country are fielding those questions and, so far, saying that they are unconstitutional.

As these district court decisions are now being appealed, liberals and libertarians are coming together to explain why the Constitution's sweeping guarantee of equality unambiguously applies to all persons and prohibits discriminatory marriage laws. Cato and CAC, for example, have jointly filed briefs in six cases challenging different states' same-sex marriage bans.

Another case that may end up at the court is ACLU v. Clapper, which challenges the constitutionality of the National Security Agency's collection of Americans' phone records. Libertarians will definitely join liberals to urge the court in fighting this invasion of Americans' privacy. Meanwhile, voter ID laws offer another area for cooperation. Liberals and libertarians disagree about the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act. But Cato has expressed general opposition to voter ID laws, suggesting that this is another area in which common ground may be forged, first among advocates and ultimately among the justices if Frank v. Walker - in which a Wisconsin district judge struck down that state's voter ID law - gets that far. The court upheld a different voter ID law (one in Indiana) in 2008, but the Wisconsin judge concluded that that the 6-3 ruling didn't prevent him from striking down the Wisconsin law.

This collaboration across a broad range of issues illustrates that while libertarians and liberals differ sharply in areas such as the powers of the federal government, these groups often agree on questions of individual rights. Often these individual rights are more fully embraced by the left (such as the right to marry), but not always. Because they approached the issue as a legal rather than a political matter, CAC and Cato sided together in McDonald v. City of Chicago, a case holding that the Second Amendment, like other provisions of the Bill of Rights, applies against state laws.

The alliance of liberal and libertarian advocates will only get stronger in future terms because obviously the justices are listening. Even one of the most conservative courts in our country's history has moments when it's not so conservative.

NewsDay,NYC gay-pride parade draws grassroots crowd,"About a million celebrants -- some wearing elaborately sequined or feathered costumes, many waving rainbow-print flags exuberantly -- turned out Sunday for the New York City gay pride march marking the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village.

The 1969 riots sparked the American gay rights movement, and the parade has since blossomed from a grassroots demonstration into a national affair.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo used Sunday to introduce an initiative to increase AIDS and HIV awareness. Before stepping off in the parade, he said the state's goal was to ensure HIV was no longer an epidemic by 2020.

New York State ""in many ways was ground zero of the HIV and AIDS crisis when it started about 30 years ago,"" Cuomo said. ""I think it's fitting that New York should then be the state that is the most aggressive in eradicating this disease and actually ending this disease.""

The ""Bending the Curve"" program would attempt to identify people with HIV who are undiagnosed and link them to health care, get diagnosed people on anti-HIV therapy to keep them in good health and prevent further transmission, and provide access to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PREP, to high-risk people to keep them HIV-negative.

Yesterday's gay pride parade was the third citywide since the state legalized same-sex marriage. Some spectators wore shirts that read, ""Love is love."" Many celebrated the milestone but said there is more to be done in the realms of workplace discrimination, permitting openly gay Boy Scouts troop leaders and beyond.

""We're not going to be united until everything is done,"" said Efrain Kilfoyle-Blocker, 28, of Lindenhurst, who attended with his husband of one year, Michael.

Marni Halasa, 48, of Chelsea, wearing a bride's veil and in-line skates, brandished a sign that read, ""Everyone deserves the freedom to marry.""

NewsDay,City celebrates LGBT equality with huge showing at gay pride parade,"Fifth Avenue was loud, proud and colorful Sunday as thousands took in the beautiful weather to celebrate the city's annual gay pride parade, which took place a day after the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village.

Marchers included dancers in elaborately feathered carnival costumes, celebrants on roller skates and motorcycles and people with wreaths of multicolored balloons.

""It makes a difference when you have such a big crowd and everyone is unified. It becomes a large event that everyone around the world recognizes,"" said Joey Nicholson, 33, a librarian from Murray Hill.

More than 1 million people attended and participated in the march, which wound through midtown Manhattan to the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street, the site of the 1969 police raid and subsequent rioting that marked the start of the American gay-rights movement.

The grand marshals this year were actress Laverne Cox, the transgender star of the hit Netflix drama, ""Orange is the New Black""; Rea Carey, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force; and stage and film actor Jonathan Groff, who is also an LGBTQ activist.

Openly gay City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Queens) said he's been attending the parade for 41 years, since he was 18.

NewsDay,Lee Zeldin defeats George Demos in 1st Congressional District GOP primary,"Republican State Sen. Lee Zeldin won a bruising GOP congressional primary victory Tuesday night, surviving an aggressive $2 million campaign by challenger George Demos, who had the backing of former Gov. George Pataki and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Zeldin, of Shirley, overcame a relentless eight-month mail and TV onslaught from Demos, who outspent him more than 3-1. Demos' ads claimed that Zeldin voted in Albany for Obamacare, a charge that Zeldin just as heatedly called a lie.

The primary win means Zeldin, 34, a two-term Albany lawmaker, will get a rematch with six-term Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton). In 2008, Bishop defeated him by more than 50,000 votes in Zeldin's first political race.

Calling the victory ""extra special for me and my family,"" Zeldin said, ""We have got the opportunity to change Washington by changing the people we send to represent us.""

Zeldin was boosted by a get-out-the-vote effort by the county GOP committee. Zeldin also was backed by local and state GOP and Conservative leaders, and he was endorsed by more than 60 local officials and several former presidential contenders, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).

Zeldin also won despite the fact that he had to spend three days a week in Albany since January during the legislative session, while Demos, 37, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, was campaigning full-time.

""Obviously, we came up just a little short, or maybe a lot short. But we fought the good fight for conservative values,"" Demos told supporters.

Demos 37, spent eight months attacking Zeldin, saying he voted for a state budget that included spending for a state insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Zeldin said he opposed Obamacare and would fight to repeal it in Washington. Zeldin said the vote Demos cited was a $3.5 million re-appropriation of Medicaid funding from an earlier budget. Zeldin said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo implemented changes by executive order after Senate Republicans would not vote for it.

Demos said Zeldin should have voted against the budget that included spending for the exchange.

Zeldin touted himself as the hometown candidate who graduated from William Floyd High School and interned for State Sen. Kenneth LaValle (R-Port Jefferson). Zeldin served in the U.S. Army in Iraq and is a major in the Army Reserve. Zeldin lost to Bishop in 2008, but two years later ousted State Sen. Brian Foley (D-Blue Point) by opposing the MTA payroll tax.

Zeldin tried to paint Demos as a political opportunist, noting that he was raised in Manhattan, educated at the exclusive Trinity School and only summered on Shelter Island. He said Demos only rented locally when it came time to run for office. ""His only connection to Long Island is the Midtown Tunnel,"" Zeldin said.

Zeldin also attacked Demos for getting his campaign money from his father-in-law, a wealthy West Coast developer, and California Democrats who have backed Pelosi. Demos said he ""hates"" Pelosi and that the public does not believe he has any political ties to her.

In other congressional primaries:

In the 3rd District Republican primary, Grant M. Lally, an attorney, was leading Stephen A. Labate, a financial planner by about 100 votes in a very close race. Labate, 46, of Deer Park, is a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves who has been activated three times since Sept. 11, 2001. Lally, 52, of Lloyd Harbor, ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1994 and 1996 against then-Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman. The winner will face Rep. Steve Israel (D-Huntington) in November.

In the 5th District Democratic primary, Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, 60, who is seeking his eighth term, defeated accountant Joseph R. Marthone, 53.

Meeks, of St. Albans, Queens, is a ranking member of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee and a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. Marthone, of Jamaica, Queens, has worked as a community organizer and is a founding chairman of the Lady Mitz Foundation, which focuses on HIV/AIDS education.

The district is Queens-based but includes Elmont, North Valley Stream and Inwood.

NewsDay,Medical marijuana in New York: Who will be able to use it?,"About midday Friday, the New York Senate voted to approve a medical marijuana bill. If you’re just skimming the headlines, you might expect to start seeing people smoking joints all over New York. Not so fast. There will be no legal way to smoke marijuana, and the list of conditions that make someone eligible to use medical marijuana is brief.



Early last week, the version of the law prohibited smoking medical marijuana in a public place, anywhere smoking tobacco is prohibited, and for anyone under the age of 21, but did not preclude the option entirely. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had demanded several changes, including a ban on smoking, which has now been added.



“Take smoke out of the picture and it softens the blow,” says says Dr. Jeffrey L. Reynolds, executive director of the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (LICADD), “both from a medical standpoint and in terms of the message we’re sending to the community.”



So who is eligible for medical marijuana?



The list for eligibility was significantly reduced during this week’s negotiations. Only patients with the following would be eligible for a medical marijuana prescription:

- Cancer

- Positive status for human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS)

- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gherig’s disease)

- Parkinson's disease

- Multiple sclerosis

- Damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord

- Epilepsy

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- Neuropathies

- Huntington's disease



In addition, anyone with the following conditions or complications as a result of the list above:

- Cachexia or wasting syndrome

- Severe or chronic pain

- Severe nausea

- Seizures

- Severe or persistent muscle spasms



The state’s Department of Health commissioner, who will oversee medical marijuana, will determine in the coming years whether to add Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, dystonia, post-traumatic stress disorder and rheumatoid arthritis. The commissioner has discretion to add others to the list.

NewsDay,Medical-marijuana backers await program details,"ALBANY

New York's approval of a medical-marijuana program ended a political debate. But the questions are just beginning.

Supporters were joyous after lawmakers struck a deal last week to make New York the 23rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. Yet they also were anxious about the many details that still need to be addressed.

How will doctors be certified to prescribe medical marijuana? Where can you get it? Will every region have a dispensary? How much will it cost? Will the list of eligible diseases and conditions expand?

""It's going to be a long process to get this up and running,"" said Tracy Ofri, a Valley Stream resident and multiple sclerosis patient who uses a walker. She's one of many medical marijuana advocates who have been lobbying lawmakers at the State Capitol for months.

""At least, now, we're on the board,"" she said. ""It's on its way.""

Here are some of the key parameters of the program and issues to be resolved:

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

ELIGIBILITY

According to the Cuomo administration, the bill allows patients with the following conditions to qualify: cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord with objective neurological indication on intractable spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathies and Huntington's disease.

Regulations also will allow the state health commissioner to add to the list as he determines.

Legislators originally wanted no limit on treatable conditions, preferring to permit physicians to make case-by-case decisions. They reduced it to 20 conditions, then cut it even further at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's insistence.

One condition omitted: post-traumatic stress disorder.

Advocates said they would push to add it to the list. ""With all the veterans out there suffering from PTSD, this is a real concern,"" said Gabriel Sayegh, state director of the Drug Policy Alliance.

TIMELINE

The program could open for business no earlier than 18 months after Cuomo signs the bill. But it could be longer -- the state Health Department must certify that the program is ready before any patients could begin receiving treatment.

Further, interested doctors would have to receive training about doses and other issues to be certified to prescribe medical marijuana. It's unclear how soon training would begin, but lawmakers want it to start well before the program goes live.

State Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island), a prime sponsor of the legislation, said setting a timeline was key to encouraging companies to compete. ""We had to have a start date or the industry would take a pass on New York and we didn't want that to happen,"" she said.

FORMS

No form of smoking would be allowed. Patients could receive the product through oil, edible forms and vaporizers.

CONTROLS

The state Health Department will issue dosage guidelines and no patient can possess more than a 30-day supply. Patients must keep the product in its original packaging until used and may not share with other patients.

Approved patients would receive registration cards.

Only New York State residents may participate, as well as only physicians who are registered and practice in the state. The law also prohibits a patient from being discriminated against on the job solely for being a medical marijuana patient.

Prescriptions would be tracked with the state's I-Stop program for monitoring prescription narcotics. Physicians and pharmacists could be prosecuted for illegal prescriptions.

Authorization for the program would have to be renewed after seven years. Further, the governor could terminate it at any time.

GROWTH, SALES

AND LOCATIONS

The state would select a maximum of five manufacturers to produce medical marijuana. Each could operate up to four dispensaries, giving the state up to 20 dispensary locations.

Cuomo said ""geographic diversity"" would be a consideration in selecting sites.

Sayegh and others worry that's too few for the state. ""Will 20 dispensaries be enough for a state with almost 20 million people?"" he said.

Savino acknowledged ""that is a concern"" but said the legislation allows the Health Department to expand the number. Sayegh said New Jersey put ""too many restrictions"" on companies, resulting in the loss of two of its dispensaries.

The health department and State Police will set the price per dose. ""We have to make sure the product is not more expensive than [marijuana] street value, so that patients don't go out and buy it from the black market,"" the senator said.

REVENUE, JOBS

The state will apply a 7 percent excise tax on manufacturers. Counties that host manufacturers would get 22.5 percent of the revenue generated; counties that host dispensaries would get another 22.5 percent. Five percent would go to state substance abuse programs; 5 percent to criminal justice services and the rest to be appropriated by the governor and legislators.

Savino couldn't say exactly how many jobs would be created but said that in other states, each ""grow operation"" can employ ""several dozen people.""",21/06/2014
NewsDay,New York State agrees to legalize medical marijuana with limits,"ALBANY -- State lawmakers reached an agreement Thursday that would make New York the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana.

Under the terms of the agreement, the system would prohibit the smoking of marijuana and would allow use only in connection with about 10 diseases and syndromes. The drug would be available only through other forms, such as edibles, oils and vaporizers. Physicians and patients would face criminal penalties for abuse of the system.

The program wouldn't start for at least 18 months. Five regulated manufacturers would be selected to grow the drug in the state and operate four dispensaries each. The drug would have to be cultivated and distributed all within New York borders, and non-state residents wouldn't be eligible for treatment. The state would assess a 7 percent tax on manufacturers.

Additionally, the legislation would authorize medical marijuana for just seven years, with an evaluation after that. Further, it gives the governor power to abruptly stop the program if he sees abuse or other problems, based on input from the state Health Department.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a former opponent of medical marijuana, called that a ""fail-safe"" provision that made him comfortable enough to back the legislation.

""Medical marijuana has the possibility to do a lot of good for a lot of people who are in pain and who are suffering and are in desperate need of a treatment that can provide relief,"" said Cuomo, a Democrat who is running for re-election this fall. ""At the same time, it's a difficult issue because there are also risks that have to be averted -- public-health risks, public-safety risks -- and we believe this bill strikes the right balance.""

Smoking for medical purposes could be allowed in the future, if the Health Department and State Legislature agree.

The state Assembly expected to approve the medical marijuana bill after midnight. The State Senate, where the issue is more contentious delayed a vote until Friday.

The agreement was struck after several days of intense negotiations by legislators and vocal rallies at the State Capitol by medical marijuana supporters. Activists blamed Cuomo for stalling until the final days of the session and accused him of trying to run out the clock. But in the end the governor won many of the concessions he was looking for, most significantly banning smoking, gaining the power to end the program and cutting the number of eligible conditions in about half.

The measure was almost two decades in the making for Assembly Health Committee chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan). ""You know, it's really gratifying after all these years to be able to help some very seriously ill people,"" he said.

His efforts received a big boost this year. Statewide polls this election year showed broad support. Another key was the frequent protests and personal stories told by people, many in wheelchairs and many of them children, suffering pain and chronic seizures that could be eased by marijuana.

""I'm gratified that legislation is going through,"" said Missy Miller, an Atlantic Beach resident who has been among a regular group of those lobbying at the Capitol for months. ""While I'm very happy that we're going to have a program, I'm petrified that my son is not going to live long enough to benefit.""

Miller said she's tried almost 20 medications to ease the seizures endured by her son, Oliver, 14, who has a severe form of epilepsy and uses a wheelchair.

She said children in other states, such as Colorado, have slowed their seizures through medical marijuana.

State Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island), the bill's prime Senate sponsor, had called Cuomo's demands ""non-starters"" on Monday. Three days later she was satisfied with the compromise. ""You can't stand in the way,"" she said, noting there are alternate delivery methods. "" . . . If that [smoking] becomes the only thing that stands in the way, you can't say no to that. It just doesn't make any sense.""

Savino said the list of eligible conditions is sufficient for now, but allows for expansion.

She said the legislature's bargaining to make the new law's effective date 18 months after the governor's signature was important because without a start date the marijuana industry might have ""taken a pass on New York.""Sen. Phil Boyle (R-Bay Shore) had offered an alternate bill that banned smoking among other things. He applauded the compromise.

""This measure will provide relief for people with legitimate medical needs while guarding against individuals diverting toward recreational use,"" Boyle said in a statement.

NewsDay,"Diane Savino, medical marijuana bill sponsor, trades insults with Cuomo","ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is putting unreasonable demands on a medical marijuana proposal with little time remaining in the legislative session, a key senator said Monday.

Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island), the sponsor of a bill to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes, and the Democratic governor traded small insults on the issue as the session moved into its final week. Cuomo countered that legislators hadn't tackled medical marijuana in a thoughtful way and contended their proposal could ""wreak havoc.""

Savino said the governor's criticisms were ""disingenuous"" and ""somewhat ridiculous,"" and activists questioned whether the governor's objections were an attempt to kill the legislation.

The jockeying occurred as lawmakers intensified efforts to get bills before adjourning for the summer and moving on to their re-election campaigns. Though they are slated to leave Thursday, they reported no real progress on key issues, including combating the rise of heroin or delaying a new teacher-evaluation system. The push to delay seems all but dead.

As part of last-minute negotiations on medical marijuana, Cuomo proposed limiting pot dispensaries to just four across New York and authorizing them for just a five-year period. Savino said such conditions would mean the medical marijuana industry likely never gets off the ground in the state.

""It would send a red flag to the marijuana industry in other states: Don't come to New York. We're closed for business,"" Savino told reporters.

Cuomo said of Savino's bill: ""It's not necessarily the best program from a public safety, public health point of view,"" signaling to some that the governor wanted to take control of an issue that lawmakers have pushed aggressively this year.

Among other things, Cuomo said the bill authored by Savino and Assemb. Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) allows one patient to accumulate too much pot per month.

""I'm not going to be part of a system that is just going to wreak havoc,"" Cuomo said. Later, he added that Savino is ""not a health professional.""

Savino said Gottfried has worked on the issue 18 years and she's worked on it ""every day of the last two years.

""To suggest that we haven't approached this in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner, you know, I think is, uh, somewhat ridiculous,"" Savino said.

The Drug Policy Alliance, which has been lobbying to legalize medical marijuana, said ""patients and families are alarmed by Cuomo's actions."" The group said the governor's proposals include eliminating some eligible conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, AIDS/HIV and muscular dystrophy.

""Some of the concerns raised by the governor are already addressed in the legislation, and the bill sponsors have agreed to address even more, so why isn't the governor negotiating in good faith with the bill sponsors?"" said Gabriel Sayegh, state director of the alliance.

With the deadline looming, lawmakers are trying to pass measures to renew red-light cameras for Nassau and Suffolk counties, enact a Water Quality Control Act for Long Island, and give Nassau and Suffolk one additional Family Court judge each.

They are also looking to find consensus on dozens of anti-heroin proposals, ranging from supplying schools with naloxone, to converting shuttered state prisons to drug-addiction treatment centers, to changing insurance laws to get addicts into inpatient treatment settings sooner than under current law -- the one proposal activists said would make the most immediate impact.",16/06/2014
NewsDay,Long Island Pride Parade draws record crowd in Huntington,"They came covered in rainbows: Rainbow shorts, dresses, tutus, flags, bandannas, wigs and body paint dotted the parade route down Main Street in Huntington on Saturday as the 24th annual Long Island Pride Parade rolled through town.

More than 18,000 people took part in the parade, a record year of attendance, said David Kilmnick, CEO of Bay Shore-based Long Island Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Network, which hosts the Pride events. After, the crowd headed to Heckscher Park for an afternoon of entertainment, beer, wine and food at PrideFest.

The biggest excitement came when grand marshal Edie Windsor slowly made her way down Main Street, perched atop a convertible, as fans rushed toward the car to get a closer look and snap pictures. Windsor, 84, is a gay rights icon whose lawsuit led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

""It's very overwhelming in a positive way,"" said Lisa Cohen, 59, of Huntington, who watched the parade with her wife, Amy Lipton, 56. The couple have been together for 22 years and married 10 years ago in Toronto. ""When we saw Edie Windsor, that's when we started to cry. We both lost it.""

The Supreme Court's ruling on DOMA last June paved the way for marriage equality across the country. New York made gay marriage legal in 2011.

""Let's hope it keeps getting easier for the next generation,"" Cohen said, recalling a time when being openly gay came with an element of fear.

PrideFest brought music until 6 p.m. from such performers as the elaborately painted operatic singer Prince Poppycock, a former ""America's Got Talent"" contestant, and Long Island native Taylor Dayne.

More than 60 vendors and community organizations set up booths at the festival, and health professionals were on hand to administer HIV/AIDS tests.

""While we're celebrating today and we're joyous, we still need to be reminded that our work is not done,"" Kilmnick said. ""Kids are still at risk for bullying. There's a health disparity with HIV among young gay and bisexual men again, and there's a lot of violence against the transgender community.""",14/06/2014
NewsDay,Editorial: Legalize medical marijuana in New York,"It's time to make medical marijuana legal in New York.

Seriously ill people enduring chronic pain, nausea and wasting from loss of appetite could see those debilitating symptoms mitigated by the drug, according to the National Academy of Sciences. Other controlled substances, such as morphine and other opiates, are used legally for medical purposes despite the obvious potential for abuse. It should be the same for marijuana, which is less fraught with peril.

After years of controversy, proponents of legalization have settled on a proposal in identical bills before the Senate and Assembly that would tightly regulate medical marijuana's distribution and use.

It would authorize doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners to certify that a patient has one of 21 severe medical conditions in the legislation, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and Parkinson's, and would benefit from marijuana use. Those patients would have to register with the state health department and receive a registry photo identification card. Medical practitioners would recommend the appropriate dosage, but patients could get no more than 21/2 ounces a month.

Organizations would have to be licensed by the state to grow, distribute and dispense medical marijuana. Smokable marijuana would be prohibited for patients younger than 21, and products attractive to children, such as confections and carbonated beverages, would be banned.

While raising state revenue isn't the reason to legalize medical marijuana, it would be taxed at 7 percent. Forty-five percent of the money would go to the state and 45 percent would be shared by localities where it's grown and dispensed. The remainder would be set aside for drug abuse counseling and treatment and grants to law enforcement.

Twenty states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. New York ought to be the next to recognize that the benefit for the sick and dying far outweighs any risk.",13/06/2014
NewsDay,Will Dave Chappelle return to TV?,"""Why did Dave Chappelle leave?""

Aren't you sick of that question, too? (Chappelle is, I would imagine.) It's one of those evergreen queries permanently embedded in the Internet hivemind -- and if you don't believe me, type in ""why did Dave ..."" and let Google complete the question for you.

It's obnoxious, tiresome, a reflection on our world's fixation on the trivial and the over-and-done-with. So let's get to a better question, shall we? Will Chappelle ever return to TV?

David Letterman had Chappelle on ""Late Show"" the other night, but Dave -- Letterman, not Chappelle -- didn't pursue this more interesting line of inquiry, and instead gave Chappelle an opening for a funny line -- that he never left TV or Comedy Central in 2005, in fact, but that ""I'm seven years late for work.""

Har. But seriously. Chappelle will be on ""The Tonight Show"" Friday where the question, or both of them, may even come up again. (Although Fallon is not exactly an interviewer.) What's intriguing about the ""Tonight"" appearance, in fact, are the Roots -- former music advisers, maybe even performers on Chappelle's old Comedy Central show. Maybe one of those guys will do the asking.

Another question I would hope Jimmy asks is this: How are you and Neal Brennan getting along these days? Chappelle and Brennan go way back -- they produced the ineffably awful movie, ""Half Baked,"" went on to co-create and produce ""Chappelle's Show,"" then when Chappelle walked away, they had a bitter falling out. But apparently they're friendly again. Could a Brennan/Chappelle reunion on TV even happen?

But before we can ask the ""will he?"" you have to get a little bit closer to the ""why did he?""

That's not so easy to come by. One possible explanation is that Chappelle has long had a tortured relationship with his fans -- many of them white, many of them guys, many of them weaned on sketch material that even Chappelle came to belatedly recognize wasn't a send up of racial stereotypes, but a reinforcement of them. Chappelle, in other words, was feeding the beast, not taming the beast, and didn't know it until it was too late. (The famous anecdote, first reported by Time, was that he was horrified when he saw some white guy laughing uproariously at a ""black pixie"" joke -- an indication to Chappelle that he'd unintentionally wandered into quasi-minstrel territory, or so he had feared.)

Another question Letterman left unasked was -- what happened in Hartford this time last year? Chappelle, essentially in the midst of his comeback, walked offstage at the Comcast Center to jeers and boos. Reasons are still unclear what happened -- videos indicate enough blame to go around everywhere, for Chappelle simply lost control of a crowd that was clearly filled with drunken idiots.

He won't have that walk-off option when he begins a series of gigs at Radio City later this month, but the spotlight is once again on him, and the questions will simply keep coming.

Will Chappelle return to CC? Will Fallon ask him that tomorrow night? Will Chappelle give him a straight answer if he does?

My hunch, and this is a hunch only, is that the door remains open for Chappelle at CC. There are no bad feelings, I believe, but no discussions either. Both parties have simply not been in contact.

Nevertheless, who knows, really. A return to the network in any capacity would be huge news, especially huge for Chappelle, who would certainly be guaranteed a vast audience, if only even an initial sampling to see what all the fuss was about in the first place. Is that what he wants or will his audience just want to hear the old songs, so to speak?

Here's the Letterman interview again (above), but if the ""whither Chappelle"" story is one of those tales you just can't get enough of, go to YouTube to find his various appearances on ""Inside the Actors Studio"" -- they're the best online resource to the Mind of Chappelle.",12/06/2014
NewsDay,Pitts: We can fix this century's biggest problem,"How about some good news for a change?

Last month, I wrote about the kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls by a band of putative men who style themselves ""Boko Haram"" -- ""Western Education is Forbidden."" Taken in concert with the 2012 shooting of Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan and the 2008 acid attack on Shamsia Husseini in Afghanistan, this latest outrage cements an impression that Islamic extremists are petrified of girls and what they might become with a little education.

It is a frustrating, anger-making thing. ""Make me wanna holler,"" as Marvin Gaye once sang.

But this time for some reason, I needed to do more than holler. I needed to take action. It seemed to me the best way to fight against people seeking to interdict the education of Nigerian girls was to help ensure that still more Nigerian girls go to school.

That led me to the Peace Corps Nigeria Alumni Foundation (PCNAF.org), a small group of Peace Corps vets in greater Washington, D.C., that exists for the specific purpose of providing scholarships for Nigerian girls. I spoke to their president, Albert Hannans, verified their link to the Peace Corps, searched Lexis-Nexis for red flags. Finding none, I sent a small donation to PCNAF c/o P.O. Box 65530, Washington, D.C. 20035 and wrote about it in this space. I figured a few of you might do the same.

I was wrong. It wasn't a few of you. It was a whole bunch of you. So many that Hannans tells me the little group's treasurer is overwhelmed and it's become a welcome hardship just running back and forth to the bank. The present tally: $35,000 and climbing, a huge amount given that $500 represents a year's tuition.

Or as Hannans puts it: ""Wow.""

""It gives us the opportunity to provide support to a lot more girls. We've had very limited resources. That has changed now."" Hannans says PCNAF is even hoping to use some of the funds to benefit the kidnapped girls themselves. He's trying to arrange that when they are released, some will be able to attend American University of Nigeria, which has a secondary school (equivalent to a U.S. high school) on its campus and, better, ""a very sizable security force.""

So first of all, thank you. You have done a wondrous, miraculous thing here.

W.E.B. Du Bois was famously prescient when he said, ""The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line."" Well, it seems apparent the problem of the 21st century is the problem of the gender line, men in backward places (and some not-so-backward places) working to keep over half of humankind in its ""place."" One way they do this is by enforcing ignorance.

Hannans defines the lack of access to basic education as a crisis that directly affects U.S. interests. His reasoning? Ignorant places are invariably poor places and frequently, also unstable places, susceptible to the appeal of loud voices offering scapegoats and easy answers. So places that might otherwise provide markets for U.S. goods become instead places needful of U.S. help -- and recruiting stations for terrorism.

Nigeria is Exhibit A, a nation of 12-year-old brides, flourishing HIV rates and scant educational opportunities. Hannans wants better for Nigeria's girls. ""We want to see them value themselves more and their abilities and their capabilities, to come out of their shells and blossom."" This is the energizing mission of his life. He is 70 years old.

There is a moral to the story: Often, the horrors of this world make us feel small, anonymous, helpless to effect change. But that is an illusion. There is nothing -- nothing -- that cannot be moved by the power of aroused people united for a righteous cause. Sometimes, the world makes you want to holler and that's understandable. But when people take action?

""Wow.""

NewsDay,'The Normal Heart' review: AIDS story still stuns,"HBO's ""The Normal Heart"" aired Sunday, and for the network -- and director Ryan Murphy -- this is a considerable undertaking not without risk, for these times are, in some regards, more polarized than '85, when the Joseph Papp production opened at the Public Theater. (The role of Ned Weeks -- essentially the play's author Larry Kramer - was originated by ""Midnight Express'"" Brad Davis - Billy Hayes -- who died in 1991, after having contracted AIDS.)

""The Normal Heart,"" HBO, Sunday, 9

What it's about: A disease is ravaging the gay community in New York, and writer Ned Weeks (Mark Ruffalo) is told by Dr. Emma Brookner (Julia Roberts) that sexual practices are likely tied to the emerging pandemic. And so begins his campaign - to convince the gay community, which equates sexual freedom with political identity, that it may be destroying itself, while also getting the rest or the New York establishment to pay attention, and proffer funds, which it is very reluctant to do.

With Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch), Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons) and others, he creates the Gay Men's Health Crisis, but Weeks alienates almost everyone, except his own lover, Felix Turner (Matt Bomer), a reporter at The New York Times, which ignores him as well. Based on the 1985 play by Larry Kramer, and directed by Ryan Murphy, this is Kramer's roman-à-clef.

My say: Reviving ""The Normal Heart"" couldn't have been an easy call for HBO or even Murphy, who is something of a kindred spirit with Kramer. Even in this moment of broad cultural acceptance of gay life and culture, there are many straight Americans who still see HIV-AIDS as a ""gay cancer,"" or worse -- the Scourge They Brought Upon Themselves.

Viewed in that context, ""The Normal Heart"" isn't just a cultural artifact but as relevant now as ever, especially considering that 36 million people have died over the intervening years.

But this ""Normal Heart"" really has to be viewed in the context of 1985, when the pandemic was just underway, and the answers needed to urgent questions were still years in the future. Kramer, who went on to found Act Up, really was in a fury, and you can almost imagine him screaming at his word processor as he wrote.

That's the raw power of ""The Normal Heart"" -- and the single biggest problem confronting viewers. You at moments do feel like you're getting punched over an argument that was settled years ago - and for millions of Americans saved by antiretroviral drugs, providentially settled too.

Why so much anger now? Murphy and his cast navigate their way around this by locating the humanity in the polemics -- and ""The Normal Heart"" can be polemical, or, worse, can proceed with connect-the-dots narrative that feels occasionally TV-movie dated too.

""Heart,"" however, is largely Ned Weeks' story, and there's a moment early in the film that's clearly intended to rivet both the viewer's attention as much as his -- and succeeds. He is walking down a quiet path at dusk, when he comes upon a threesome -- a twisting, pulsating mass of human flesh that seems straight out of ""Satyricon"" (if ""Satyricon"" had been set on Fire Island, circa 1981).

Already critical of gay promiscuity, he finds this spectacle leaving him uncharacteristically speechless So this is the ultimate political expression of gay rights? Murphy plays this as a pivotal episode in the emerging portrait of the pre-radical, because if Weeks knows something is wrong -- terribly wrong -- why doesn't the rest of the world know as well?

That's the heart of ""The Normal Heart,"" and what animates it, and ultimately turns it into something more than just another revival of a 30-year-old play. Weeks is a prophet who occasionally flays himself as much as others, because their world, after all, is his world too.

As superb as Ruffalo is, there are others who intermitently exceed him, at least in those few sharply drawn moments that underscore the furious urgency of the play (and movie): Joe Mantello, as Gay Men's Health Crisis staffer Mickey Marcus, who rages against Weeks and his own confusion. Or Parson's Boatwright, who collected and saved the Rolodex cards of the dead. Or Bomer's Turner, who is slowly consumed by the disease killing so many thousands of others. Or Roberts, as the wheelchair-bound Cassandra whose fury may actually exceed Weeks'.

The cast succeeds, and in the end, so does ""Heart.""

Bottom line: Excellent cast mitigates the flaws.

NewsDay,Bobcats officially become Hornets in Charlotte,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. - The Charlotte Hornets are back.

The NBA franchise announced Tuesday at a press conference it has officially changed its name back to the Hornets after 10 years of being known as the Bobcats.

The change comes nearly one year after owner Michael Jordan indicated he wanted to change the name back to the Hornets.

The league approved the change last July.

Jordan didn't attend the press conference, but issued a statement saying it's a ""historic day for our franchise, our city and our fans.""

The Hornets resided in Charlotte from 1988-2002 before George Shinn moved the team -- and name -- to New Orleans after a messy divorce from the city. The name became available again when New Orleans owner Tom Benson changed his team's name from the Hornets to the Pelicans.

Several hundred fans showed up at the downtown arena for the formal announcement.

Hornets president and CEO Fred Whitfield said the goal is restore the energy the Hornets brought to the city when they were in Charlotte 12 years ago playing at the Charlotte Coliseum, which was known by fans simply as ""The Hive.""

It was there the Hornets were consistently among the league leaders in attendance.

""For me this day is almost surreal because I was a Hornets season ticket holder,"" Whitfield said. ""I know what it felt like in the old Hive and the energy and excitement that happened to be there. Michael talks fondly about the days he came in and played against the Hornets and what a challenge it was not only to battle a good team, but also the fans.""

Whitfield also announced that in collaboration with the NBA and the Pelicans, all of the statistical information, records and history of the Charlotte NBA basketball will be restored to the franchise.

That means the Hornets will now own and have access to all of the historical elements from the recent Bobcats' era (2004-14) as well as the original Hornets teams that played in Charlotte -- including stats from stars such as Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning and Muggsy Bogues.

All of the Hornets records from their years in New Orleans will revert to the Pelicans' history, Whitfield said.

""That was a piece that was really important to us because we knew how important that was to our fans,"" Whitfield said. ""Being able to have the old Hornets alumni back and be a part of family was important. We can say to them, 'Hey, you are welcome back and you are a part of the family.'""

Whitfield estimates the name change will cost Jordan more than $4 million before all is said and done. The team is still working through the tedious process of rebranding the arena.

But Hornets logos have begun to spring up inside and outside of the arena.

""It's been well worth it,"" Whitfield said. ""And it couldn't have happened without the financial commitment of our owner.""

The Hornets unveiled their new logos in December.

They'll unveil their new uniforms on June 19 and the playing floor design on June 26. The Hornets' name will return to NBA action at the 2014 Summer League in Las Vegas.

The popular Hugo the Hornet mascot will make his official return on June 5.

Pete Guelli, the team's executive vice president and chief sales and marketing officer, said fans have embraced the name change.

He said 90 percent of last year's season ticket holders have renewed for the 2014-15 season. He also said the Hornets are currently No. 1 in the league for new season tickets sales.",20/05/2014
NewsDay,"De Blasio touts housing initiative for low-income residents with HIV, AIDS","The fight against AIDS and HIV is now in its fourth decade, but many advocates are working to ensure the cause doesn't lose its urgency because ""this crisis continues and we have more to do,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday, speaking in Central Park for the GMHC AIDS Walk.

""This is one of the things a citizen can do that makes a huge difference, standing up and acting because the fight continues,"" he told about 30,000 participants in the walk, which raises money and awareness. ""Sometimes when the struggle goes on so long, people lose their sense of urgency . . . but you haven't let that happen. You feel the passion to keep fighting.""

The mayor touted an initiative with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that seeks to help low-income New York City residents living with HIV or AIDS.

The measure, announced by de Blasio and Cuomo in February and part of the fiscal year 2015 state budget, caps the rent of those who qualify at 30 percent of their income. New York City will cover about two-thirds of the program's cost, while the state will pay for the remaining one-third.

The housing subsidy provides the residents with a ""measure of justice,"" de Blasio said Sunday.

The mayor also said the city's Human Resources Administration and its Health and Hospitals Corporation offers services for people with HIV and AIDS.

De Blasio Monday is set to deliver the keynote address at Internet Week New York, outlining the role of the technology industry in the city's economy.

NewsDay,Donald Sterling takes shots at Magic Johnson,"Donald Sterling apologized profusely for the bigoted remarks that led to the league's efforts to force him to sell the Clippers in an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper that aired Monday night. But Sterling poured fuel on the fire he started by attacking Magic Johnson on several levels.

Emotional to the point of crying during the interview, Sterling apologized to his fellow NBA owners, to his estranged wife, Shelly, and even to Johnson, if only grudgingly. In one breath, the 80-year-old billionaire real estate developer described V. Stiviano, 31, the girlfriend who taped him expressing bigoted views, as a ""special person,"" and in the next, he suggested she ""baited"" him into making racially charged remarks and called her a ""street person.""

""I'm not a racist,"" Sterling said. ""I made a terrible mistake, and I'm here to apologize to all the people I've hurt. I never dreamt this would happen. It's a terrible nightmare.""

Sterling was taped by Stiviano expressing his concern that she posted pictures of herself and a girlfriend posing with Johnson on her Facebook page. During the course of the tape, he asked her not to bring African-Americans to his games.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver reacted by banning Sterling from the NBA for life and imposing the maximum $2.5-million fine. Silver also initiated a process to gain approval of three-fourths of the other 29 owners to force Sterling to sell the team.

The league installed former Citibank and Time Warner head Dick Parsons as interim CEO of the Clippers. He met with the media yesterday Monday in Los Angeles and expressed confidence that Sterlingwill have to sell, saying, ""My personal belief is the league will prevail, which means there will be an ownership change.""

Sterling insisted the Clippers' players ""love me"" and contended he has received support from fans and sponsors. But he added, ""The media hates me.""

Sterling said it was jealousy of Stiviano's friendships that drove him to make ""stupid, uneducated remarks."" Sterling then claimed Johnson called and spoke to him twice after the firestorm erupted, said he knew Stiviano and urged Sterling to wait before saying anything. ""He lulled me into waiting a week,"" Sterling said. ""I think he wanted me to do nothing so he could buy the team.""

Sterling criticized Johnson as a poor role model because he contracted HIV and suggested he had not helped the African-American community in Los Angeles. ""He acts so holy,"" Sterling said of Johnson. ""He does nothing. It's all talk.""

Sterling's comments about Johnson earned him a quick rebuke from Silver.

""I just read a transcript of Donald Sterling's interview with Anderson Cooper, and while Magic Johnson doesn't need me to, I feel compelled on behalf of the NBA family to apologize to him that he continues to be dragged into this situation and be degraded by such a malicious and personal attack,"" Silver said.

NewsDay,LI pharmacy owner sentenced in $16M Medicaid fraud,"A Dix Hills man who admitted his part in a scheme to defraud the state's Medicaid program of more than $16 million was sentenced Monday to 1 to 3 years in prison, state prosecutors said.

Raheel Pervez, 41, was sentenced in Bronx Supreme Court before Justice Steven Barrett, state Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman's office said in a news release.

Among six individuals involved in a scheme that drained more than $16 million from the state Medicaid program, Pervez pleaded guilty to felony enterprise corruption last month, officials said.

The fraud involved more than a dozen pharmacies that paid HIV patients not to fill their prescriptions and then billed Medicaid for those unfilled prescriptions, the news release said.

Three of the pharmacies, two of which operated as the scam's central hubs, were previously ordered to pay $16.7 million in restitution to Medicaid. In addition to prison time, Pervez has agreed to pay $500,000 in civil forfeiture, Schneiderman's office said.

Pervez ""admitted to being the straw owner of the three indicted pharmacies, which were actually owned and controlled by his father, Mujahid 'Peter' Pervez,"" officials said.

The elder Pervez, charged as the leader of the enterprise, had been excluded from participating in the state Medicaid program because of a previous fraud conviction, officials said. He also was prohibited from owning or controlling any pharmacy that treats Medicaid recipients.

Despite the ban, from January 2009 to April 2012 the enterprise acquired 13 Medicaid-enrolled pharmacies on Long Island and in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens, defrauded the state and victimized hundreds of Medicaid recipients by submitting false claims to Medicaid for prescription medications that it rarely, if ever, dispensed, the release said.

Raheel Pervez admitted that the three indicted pharmacies were controlled by his father and that he knowingly filed false documents with the state claiming ownership and control of each of these pharmacies, including Langdale Drug & Surgical Supplies in New Hyde Park, officials said.

Indicted along with his son and others on charges of enterprise corruption, grand larceny and other crimes, the elder Pervez fled to his native Pakistan; the attorney general's office is seeking to extradite him to New York, officials said.Raheel Pervez also is excluded from Medicaid as a provider and agreed to not be involved in the health care industry in any manner, officials said.",05/05/2014
NewsDay,Report: Antibiotics are losing effectiveness worldwide,"A post-antibiotic era in which common infections and minor injuries once again lead to death is a real possibility this century, the World Health Organization said in the first global survey of resistance to antimicrobial drugs.

WHO also saw significant gaps in disease surveillance and lack of coordination of data sharing.

Resistance to antibiotics is particularly acute with tuberculosis, affecting about 630,000 people globally, and drug effectiveness is declining among patients with malaria, HIV and influenza, WHO said. Ten countries have reported that gonorrhea is untreatable by any antibiotic.

NewsDay,'Breast milk banks' gain in popularity,"A wave of new nonprofit breast milk banks are opening across North America, driven by research that has promoted the use of donated mother's milk for healthy babies.

Five new milk banks are expected to open this year in the United States and Canada, joining four that opened in 2013 and bringing the total number of nonprofit milk banks up to 22, said Kim Updegrove, president of the Human Milk Banking Association of North America.

""There's an amazing resurgence of milk banks in North America,"" Updegrove said. ""Every healthy lactating mother has the ability to save another baby's life if she is willing to go through a screening process and donate her milk through a nonprofit milk bank.""

She said breast milk contains important nutrients, immune-system antibodies and growth factors that all contribute to a baby's health, particularly babies who are vulnerable because they are premature or underweight.

""It's now irrefutable that in absence of mom's own milk, donor milk increases survival rate and improves development of vulnerable infants,"" she said.

The milk banks are proliferating in response to mounting medical research that has shown donated breast milk can nurture babies just as well as their mother's own milk, Updegrove said.

Pediatricians hope mothers will see the milk banks as a better, safer alternative to the growing practice of online breast milk sharing, said Dr. Susan Landers, a neonatologist in Austin, Texas, who sits on the American Academy of Pediatrics' section on breastfeeding.

Breast milk banks screen all donors, running tests to make sure they are not carrying an infectious disease that could be passed on through their milk, Landers said. In addition, the collected milk is pasteurized before being frozen and passed out to hospitals and families on a doctor's prescription.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Updegrove's group acts as a professional organization for the network of milk banks, laying out guidelines and certifying new banks as they come online.

""The AAP likes that set up,"" Landers said. ""We like the milk to be pasteurized. We want the donor mothers to be screened. We want doctors to know it's a sterile product and prescribe it when donor milk is needed.""

By comparison, there are no safety precautions in place for milk shared through online sites. A recent study found that nearly three-quarters of 101 breast milk samples purchased through a milk-sharing website contained bacteria that could make a baby sick -- including three batches that tested positive for salmonella.

Women who buy milk from these websites ""don't know who's got hepatitis B and who's HIV-positive and who's got germs in their milk, and none of it's pasteurized,"" Landers said. The AAP is weighing a policy statement that would discourage mothers from participating in these online swapping sites.

The idea of breast milk banking is not a new one. Back in the early 1980s, a network of 30 milk banks stretched across the United States, with another 20 in Canada.

But the HIV/AIDS health crisis of the 1980s, along with a surge in hepatitis cases, led to the shuttering of nearly all the breast milk banks, Updegrove said. At the lowest point, only one breast milk bank -- in San Jose, California -- remained open.

Breast milk banks began to reestablish themselves in North America as the value of human milk for struggling infants became more apparent and new protocols were established to ensure the safety of banked milk, she said.

These efforts were sent into overdrive by a 2012 policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics supporting the use of donor milk for at-risk newborns.

Before that policy, the AAP had said that all premature babies should be fed their own mother's milk.

But the new policy broadened that recommendation, saying that when mother's milk is not available, then premature and low-birth-weight babies should be fed donated breast milk. ""That was a big difference,"" Landers said.

One of the nation's newest nonprofit milk banks, the Northwest Mothers Milk Bank in Portland, Oregon, has succeeded well beyond its expectations since it opened in July 2013.

Organizers had projected that they would screen 40 mothers to become milk donors by the end of 2013, executive director Lesley Mondeaux said. They ended up screening 122 donors in that time, and another 79 so far this year.

One of the milk bank's donors, Dr. Emily Puterbaugh, volunteered because she's a pediatrician who had seen the benefits of breast milk for struggling babies.

""I had an oversupply,"" said Puterbaugh, 33, of Portland's Multnomah Village area. ""Realizing I was going to have more milk than I needed for my baby, the first thing I thought of was the milk bank. I figured some of this milk could be used for other babies in need.""

Becoming a volunteer donor wasn't simple. Puterbaugh had to fill out an extensive medical history for herself and her 6-month-old daughter, Nina, and get both her doctor and Nina's pediatrician to sign off on her capability to donate. She also underwent a blood screening to check for infectious diseases.

Part of the challenge the new milk banks face is getting the word out to mothers, Updegrove said.

""I meet people almost weekly who say, 'I wish I knew about the milk banks because I ended up throwing out a gallon of milk,'"" she said. ""I long to hear milk banking has become as common as blood banking, where everybody knows about it.""

Another problem is money. Although the breast milk is donated, the banks rack up expenses as they screen donors, operate milk drops, process the milk and ship it to hospitals and families.

The Northwest Mothers Milk Bank currently charges $4.50 an ounce for breast milk to break even, although it has a charitable care program to help families who can't afford the fee, Mondeaux said.

More often than not, Medicaid programs and private health insurance companies won't cover the cost of breast milk, neonatologist Landers said.

""We're not where we need to be in paying for something that we know has definitive benefits,"" she said. ""Why aren't we paying for something we know is extremely beneficial? Why are we making the hospitals eat the cost?""",30/04/2014
NewsDay,"Makeup's possible downside: chemicals, allergy triggers and other dangers","Many women wouldn't even think about leaving the house without makeup, but have they stopped to think about what all those products might be doing to their skin? Or given more than a passing thought to what's in them?

Most products are probably safe for the skin, and some even provide benefits. However, some cosmetics contain irritating chemicals, and others may even have dangerous ingredients.

""People wear makeup for a lot of different reasons: It can give them extra self-confidence.

In addition, said Dr. James Marotta, an aesthetic skin care expert and facial plastic surgeon in Smithtown, ""some makeup has minerals in it that can be anti-inflammatory, and others have ultraviolet protection, which can help protect the skin from the sun.""

But, makeup isn't a positive thing for everyone.

""Makeup can cause a rash or irritation called contact dermatitis,"" Marotta said. ""In some cases, people have true allergic reactions, like hives, to ingredients in makeup. That's known as allergic contact dermatitis. Makeup may also cause acne if a product is comedogenic, which means it blocks the pores."" He suggests looking for products labeled non-comedogenic or hypo-comedogenic.

Both experts recommend reading labels, though they concede it can be difficult to know what all the chemical names mean. As Marotta said, ""It's very difficult to know everything that's in make-up, and what the absolute risks are.""

LEAD IN SOME LIPSTICKS

And, some substances that you'd never expect to be in your makeup are considered OK in small quantities. Take lead, for example.

The Food and Drug Administration tested 400 different lipsticks for the presence of lead, a known human toxin. Lead was found in many of the brands, including those you'd find at drug and discount stores, as well as more expensive brands. However, the amount of lead contained in lipstick was low enough to be considered safe by the FDA. The agency is currently considering whether it needs to set an acceptable limit for lead content in cosmetics.

Both experts also said it's probably a good idea to avoid loose-powder products because of the risk of breathing in the powder.

""Cosmetic products aren't tested the way pharmaceuticals are, and these products aren't really tested to see if they're safe to inhale,"" Ellis noted.

In fact, the FDA doesn't regulate much in cosmetics. The only cosmetic ingredients requiring FDA approval are color additives, according to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Makeup that's made in other countries could pose additional risks. For instance, Ellis said, makeup made outside the United States that's marketed to lighten the skin might contain mercury, another known toxin.

BACTERIA CONCERNS

And there's concern about bacteria in makeup, foreign- or domestic-made.

The FDA issued warnings this month about makeup contaminated with bacteria coming from other countries. But, bacteria also can develop in products kept too long. Some cosmetics are starting to come labeled with an expiration date, but that doesn't always mean you should use a product until that date.

Once opened, mascara should be used within two to four months, according to FDA recommendations. Marotta said that lipstick generally should be used within three months of opening, and there's a little more leeway with eye shadows, blushes and foundations, which should be used within three to six months.

He also cautioned never to put makeup on broken skin because that can potentially give bacteria a way into your body.",29/04/2014

NewsDay,No obligation to disclose HIV diagnosis,"DEAR AMY: Several years ago I was diagnosed with HIV. At the time, my husband, who thankfully is not infected, and I decided that we would wait a year before telling anyone. It has been four years now and I have yet to tell anyone. I have a conservative family and it took me a long time to even come out to them, and the thought of having to tell them is scary to me. Not only that, but there is an embarrassment factor -- the fact that I did not take care of my body or take the proper precautions to prevent myself from becoming infected. Is it my responsibility to tell the people in my life about this disease? Do they have a right to know? I worry about my family's reaction, and I also don't want them to treat me any differently.

-- Getting Better

DEAR GETTING BETTER: I realize there is stigma attached to HIV, but it might help you to attain some clarity here if you could see this as a health concern that is chronic but manageable and ultimately concerns only you and any sexual partners.

So, imagine you have lupus. Would you disclose this to your parents? You might if you were having symptoms. Otherwise, maybe not. Disclosing a health condition is a very intimate act; before you do it you must trust that the person can receive the news and react in an appropriate way.

I shared your question with Kelly Ducheny, a psychologist and director of behavioral health at Howard Brown Health Center in Chicago. As a counselor who deals with individuals and couples wrestling with this issue, she has a ready answer: ""It is completely every individual person's choice whom they tell -- and how and when, or if they tell. You are under no obligation to disclose anything about your HIV status. Furthermore, there is not one option that is healthier than another.

""If you do decide to tell people, have a plan for how to disclose it. Understand that there is a processing period and their initial reaction may not be their permanent reaction.""",14/04/2014
NewsDay,Investor Carl Icahn pulls proposal that eBay sell off PayPal,"Activist investor Carl Icahn has dropped his call for eBay Inc. to split off its fast-growing PayPal payments unit but has suggested he would keep pressure on the e-commerce company.

EBay said on Thursday that it had settled its proxy fight with the billionaire, who also withdrew his two nominees for the eBay board before the company's annual shareholder meeting next month.

In a concession to Icahn, eBay said it would add David Dorman, a founding partner of investment firm Centerview Capital Technology, as an independent director on its board.

But Icahn, who in January called for hiving off PayPal before engaging in weekslong war of words with eBay, indicated he had not given up on the idea.

""I continue to believe that eBay would benefit from the separation of PayPal at some point in the near future,"" Icahn said in a statement. He said Donahoe had agreed to meet regularly to discuss strategic alternatives for PayPal.

EBay shares were down 2.7 percent at $54.37 in midday trading.

PayPal was founded in the late 1990s and went public in 2002. EBay acquired it soon afterward for $1.5 billion.

PayPal is now eBay's fastest growing business, with 143 million active users at the end of 2013, up 16 percent from a year earlier. PayPal's revenue rose 19 percent during the holiday quarter, beating a 12 percent rise at the marketplaces unit.

Get the Biz Briefing newsletter! The latest LI business news in your inbox Monday through Friday. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In the weeks after eBay disclosed Icahn's proposal, the investor wrote a number of open letters to fellow shareholders questioning Donahoe's abilities and calling corporate governance at the company among the worst he had ever seen.

In a research note earlier this week, Cantor Fitzgerald said shareholder pressure for a PayPal spinoff could increase if the company does not at least meet its lowered 2015 forecasts.

Donahoe and board members, including founder Pierre Omidyar, have repeatedly said eBay had been funding PayPal's growth, and the two were better off together.

In mid-March, Icahn appeared to backtrack, calling on eBay to sell 20 percent of PayPal in an initial public offering, rather than do a full spinoff.

Donahoe, who has been CEO since 2008, expressed relief that a potentially bruising and distracting proxy fight had ended.

""This proxy fight was not something that was helping eBay shareholders, or helping us innovate and execute more effectively,"" he told CNBC.

Dorman is a former CEO of AT&T Inc and current chairman of drugstore operator CVS Caremark Corp.",10/04/2014

NewsDay,Roundup: LGBT center to open at new location,"WOODBURY

LGBT center to open at new location

A center that brings together advocacy efforts and community programs for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents of Nassau County has moved from Garden City, where it was established in 2011, to Woodbury as the group scouts properties for a permanent home.

The Center at Woodbury is already at its new location, at 20 Crossway Dr. North, but it will officially open for events and programs on Monday, said David Kilmnick, chief executive of the Long Island GLBT Services Network that oversees three centers on the Island.

“This is a big year of transition for the organization where we are putting roots down .?.?. to really give some permanency to our centers that are really a lifeline” for the LGBT community, Kilmnick said.

A deal for the purchase of a Hicksville building fell through this year over strict requirements for a certificate of occupancy, Kilmnick said, but the organization will continue its search for a permanent site.

Its other Suffolk County centers are in Bay Shore, where the network owns a building, and in Sag Harbor where it opened a center in rented space last year.

Kilmnick said the county center has quickly become a hub with about 160 volunteers, hosting programs ranging from events for youth and seniors to free HIV testing. “In Nassau County, there was a thirst for what we do,” he said.

BABYLON

Plan to spend $800G to build on site OKd

The Town of Babylon has approved spending more than $800,000 for work related to its ashfill site.

The site, in West Babylon, houses the town’s Covanta Energy-owned garbage incinerator as well as eight ashfill cells and administrative structures. The bulk of the approved funding is $650,000 in bonds the town will issue to construct a small administrative building on the site, said spokesman Kevin Bonner.

The building will replace two temporary trailers that have been used for 25 years, he said. Up to 20 employees, who also work on the town’s lot cleanups, work out of the trailers, Bonner said.

Another $85,000 in bonds will be issued to build a concrete slab in an area next to the ashfill that is used by dump trucks bringing ash from the incinerator. The area consists of dirt, Bonner said, and has been problematic when it rains. Additionally, $50,000 in bonds will be issued to pay for the building of a vertical lining system for ashfill Cell 7, the only cell that is operational. The liner is needed to provide containment and prevent leakage, he said.

In addition, the town has approved a $35,000 contract with Kosuri Engineering & Consulting PC of New Hyde Park to assist the town in renewing its seven-year permit to operate the Cell 7 ashfill. This and all bond repayments will come from the town’s garbage funds, Bonner said. — DENISE M. BONILLA

NESCONSET

Music room named after former student

Developmental Disabilities Institute, the leading service provider for children and adults with autism on Long Island, has opened the Matthew Stansky Memorial Music Room in Nesconset.

Stansky, 23, was a former DDI student who died last year after a long illness.

Stansky's family and other donors raised $20,000 to renovate the room, at DDI’s Lake Avenue Adult Day Program.

The room’s contents include a new smart TV, wireless microphones, piano, acoustic guitars, a new drum set, music stools and benches, and numerous other instruments. A plaque hangs on the wall that reads, “A song may end but its melody lingers on forever.”

The program in Nesconset provides numerous services for more than 70 adults with autism and other developmental disabilities.

“During his short life with us, Matthew became a source of inspiration to all who knew him and provided care to him,” said John Lessard, DDI’s executive director.

“Matthew had an immense love for music,” said his mother, Millie Stansky. “It didn’t matter if he was listening to his transistor radio or a fellow peer playing the piano. Matthew would lose himself listening to music for hours on end.”

LI fire departments to host open houses

Local fire departments across the state plan to hold open houses April 26 and 27 as part of the fourth annual RecruitNY, a recruitment effort established in 2011 to help bring in more volunteers to the local fire departments. During the open houses, visitors can tour the firehouses and fire apparatus, try on gear and take part in activities throughout the firehouse, according to the Firemen’s Association of the State of New York.

The association runs the program along with the New York State Association of Fire Chiefs, the Association of Fire Districts of New York State, the Volunteer Fire Police Association of the State of New York, and the Country Fire Coordinators Association of the State of New York.

“We encourage departments to sign up to let their communities know of their participation,” said James A. Burns, president of the Firemen’s Association of the State of New York. “RecruitNY has proven a success in past years and is a key initiative to help bolster membership numbers so fire departments can continue to provide the optimum level of protection to their local residents.”

On Long Island, 14 fire departments — 11 in Nassau and three in Suffolk — are expected to host open houses, according to the RecruitNY website.

For more information and to find a list of the fire departments participating in the program, residents can visit recruitny.org.

Fire departments interested in signing up for RecruitNY can log on and fill out the form at recruitny.org/signup. — PRISCILA KORB

BRENTWOOD

Students raise $30G for cancer research

Students in the Brentwood Union Free School District collected more than $30,000 in their second-annual Relay For Life fundraiser to aid with cancer research, school officials said.

The funds, which will go to the American Cancer Society, were donated in the past several weeks. More than 200 students from the Medical Society, a club that exposes children to careers in health care, and the Relay For Life club at Brentwood Senior High spent the night at the school last Friday until 6 a.m. Saturday. They stayed up all night and walked an indoor track through the hallways as well as played volleyball, dodgeball and danced to music.

Some of the participating students have been diagnosed with lung and brain cancers, said high school principal Richard Loeschner. The groups surpassed last year’s efforts, when they raised more than $20,000.

A “Survivor’s Dinner” was also held to honor 50 cancer survivors from the Bay Shore and Brentwood areas, Loeschner said.

Sharon Littman, a speech language pathologist who has been with the district for 19 years and is a skin cancer survivor, helped coordinate this year’s events. Along with cancer awareness, the students — led by fellow classmates Sumaiya Chowdhury and Mecca Tricoche — were able to learn communication skills through asking people for help.

“Between the high school and elementary schools, thousands of people gave either a couple of bucks or a hundred bucks,” Loeschner said. “It really motivated everyone for the last few weeks. There’s a real energy and passion for this event.”

SUFFOLK COUNTY

Discounts for vets at county golf courses

Veterans and active military personnel will pay reduced fees at Suffolk County golf courses, officials announced yesterday.

The county passed legislation this year making permanent lower prices to tee off at the county’s four public golf courses for service members.

Veterans and military personnel will pay $17 for 18 holes Monday to Friday, excluding holidays, compared to $28 for Suffolk County residents and $38 for nonresidents. Military and veterans will pay the same rate as residents on the weekends and holidays, $30. Nonresidents pay $48.

Discounts are also offered for nine holes of golf.

“This is one small way we can show our appreciation to the men and women of the armed forces,” said Legis. Jay H. Schneiderman (I-Montauk), sponsor of the bill, in a statement.

Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone, Schneiderman, Legis. Tom Cilmi (R-Bay Shore) and a dozen veterans made the announcement at the Timber Point Golf Course in Great River yesterday.

Suffolk County Veterans can contact the Parks Department at 631-854-4949 or go to Suffolk County Park locations where Green Keys are sold with proper proof of residency; veterans must submit DD Form 214 (Certificate of release or Discharge from Active Duty) or a Suffolk County Veteran Resident ID card issued by Suffolk County Veterans Agency.

A pilot program of reduced fees was introduced last year, when the county said 999 rounds of golf were played by active military and veterans, according to a Budget Review Office analysis. While the report estimated that $4,034 in revenue was lost because of the discounted fees, it also said more golf might have been played because of the discount. — DAVID SCHWARTZ",03/04/2014

Unions were a path to middle class

""Blocking off our roads to success"" [Opinion, March 16] was a good start, but columnist Peter Goldmark left out the strongest ladder to the middle class: a collective bargaining agent that empowers workers by seeking a greater share of productivity gains.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The decline of unions has not been an accident. A concerted effort was started in 1947, after veterans returned home from saving the world for democracy, with an act passed over the veto of then-President Harry Truman, who called it an assault on free speech.

The Taft-Hartley Act diminished the power of unions. From the allegiance clause, to the ban on secondary boycotts, to the right to work for less laws, the legs were cut out from under the working class. That assault saw unions decline from a high of 35 percent of the private-sector workforce to 6 percent in a continuing onslaught.

The attack continues, now focused on public-sector workers and their unions and pensions. Teachers and their unions have become public enemy No. 1.

Yes, they, not the plutocrats, are responsible for the dismal test results of impoverished students, even though studies show the correlation between test scores and income. Yes, they will be replaced by privately owned, yet taxpayer-funded charter schools, employing low-paid, non-union inexperienced teachers until they burn out.

E-cigs become new fad for teens

In the article ""E-cig pitch under fire"" [News, March 10], Sen. Charles Schumer said e-cigarette sellers were using questionable marketing tactics clearly aimed at youngsters by offering bubble gum and cotton candy flavors.

I am aware that smokers turn to e-cigarettes to quit or cut down on real cigarettes, which are more harmful to their health. However, the flair of having an e-cigarette is appealing to many and has caught the specific attention of those in middle and high school. It has become the new fad.

Truth be told, e-cigs are addicting. Adding special, cool, new flavors to them may increase their sales, but at the same time could lure children, teens and adults who may never have smoked a day in their life if not for e-cigs.

As Schumer said, ""We've made so much progress in getting kids not to smoke."" Why should we risk all of that for the benefit of a few companies trying to keep up on the latest trends?

NYS mental health overhaul is mediocre

Since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, society has been discussing mental health, specifically eradicating stigma and ensuring ready access to quality community-based care [""Newtown's mental health needs,"" News, March 17].

Seventy-five percent of serious mental illness occurs before the age of 24, and half before the age of 14. Yet, only one out of five children who has an emotional disturbance receives treatment from a mental-health specialist.

In New York, continued access to care is assured only to children and families with Medicaid coverage, because reimbursement from commercial insurance is far lower and many providers will simply not accept it. The state Office of Mental Health has established a multi-year vision for the mental health system called Regional Centers of Excellence, which does not change the reimbursement formula. This will continue to marginalize community-based care for middle-class or working-poor families that have commercial health insurance.

Community clinics are the last bastion in addressing the needs of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances. Private psychotherapists and child psychiatrists, with some exceptions, will not accept commercial health insurance or will not provide the costly, labor-intensive work necessary to properly serve children and families struggling with serious emotional disturbances.

NewsDay,Sunstein: The conspiracy of conspiracy theories,"Conspiracy theories surround us. Witness the reactions on the Internet to the tragic and mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Perhaps North Korea hijacked the plane. Perhaps the Chinese are responsible.

Maybe aliens did it.

Or, as an influential legislator in Iran contended to the New York Times, perhaps the U.S. ""kidnapped"" the lost plane in an effort to ""sabotage the relationship between Iran and China and South East Asia."" Pick your topic: Ukraine, the National Security Agency, assassinations of national leaders, recent economic crises, the authorship of Shakespeare's plays -- it's child's play to assemble a host of apparent clues, and to connect a bunch of dots, to support a relevant conspiracy theory. In recent years, for example, many Americans have become convinced that the U.S. (or Israel) was responsible for the attacks of Sept. 11, that the U.S. government concocted HIV/AIDS, and that federal agencies have conspired to hide the association between vaccines and autism.

Why do people accept such theories? The first explanation points to people's predispositions. Some of us count as ""conspiracists"" in the sense that we have a strong inclination to accept such theories. Not surprisingly, conspiracists tend to have a sense of personal powerlessness; they are also more likely to conspire themselves.

Here's an excellent predictor of whether people will accept a particular conspiracy theory: Do they accept other conspiracy theories? If you tend to think that the Apollo moon landings were faked, you are more likely to believe that the U.S. was behind the 9/11 attacks. (With a little introspection, many of us know, almost immediately, whether we are inclined to accept conspiracy theories.) Remarkably, people who accept one conspiracy theory tend to accept another conspiracy theory that is logically inconsistent with it. People who believe that Princess Diana faked her own death are more likely to think that she was murdered. People who believe that Osama bin Laden was already dead when U.S. forces invaded his compound are more likely to believe that he is still alive.

The second set of explanations points to the close relationship between conspiracy theories and social networks, especially close-knit or isolated ones. Few of us have personal or direct knowledge about the causes of some terrible event -- a missing plane, a terrorist attack, an assassination, an outbreak of disease. If one person within a network insists that a conspiracy was at work, others within that network might well believe it.

Once the belief begins to spread, a lot of people within the network might accept it as well, on the theory that a spreading belief cannot possibly be wrong. And once that happens, ""confirmation bias"" tends to kick in, so that people give special weight to information that supports their view. They also treat contradictory information as irrelevant or perhaps even as proof of conspiracy. (Why would people -- ""they"" -- deny it if it weren't true?) A third explanation emphasizes how human beings are inclined to react to terrible events. Such events produce outrage, suspicion and fear. Sometimes the perpetrator is self- evident, as in the case of many terrorist attacks, but if there is no clear perpetrator -- as with a missing plane, a child's disability or the outbreak of a disease -- people might go hunting for the malicious agent behind it all.

To be sure, some conspiracy theories turn out to be true. Republican officials, operating at the behest of the White House, did, in fact, bug the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate complex. In the 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency did, in fact, administer LSD and related drugs to unknowing subjects in an effort to investigate the possibility of “mind control.” In 1947, space aliens did, in fact, land in Roswell, New Mexico, and the government covered it all up. (Well, maybe not.)

Even when false, most conspiracy theories are harmless. Consider the theory, popular among younger members of our society, that a secret group of elves, working in a remote location under the leadership of a mysterious ""Santa Claus,"" make and distribute presents on Christmas Eve. And in a free society, conspiracy theories must be allowed even if they are both false and harmful. But sometimes conspiracy theories create real dangers.

If people think that scientists have conspired to cover up the harms of vaccines, they will be less likely to vaccinate their children. That's a problem.

Unfortunately, beliefs in false conspiracy theories are also peculiarly resistant to correction. Recent research suggests that in the context of the alleged autism-vaccination link, current public health communications are unhelpful, even when they enlist facts to set the record straight.

Efforts to establish the truth might even be self- defeating, because they can increase suspicion and thus strengthen the very beliefs that they were meant to correct.

Such efforts are far more likely to succeed if they begin by affirming, rather than attacking, the basic values and commitments of those who are inclined to accept the theory.

Conspiracists like to say that the truth is out there. They're right. The challenge is to persuade them to find their way toward it.

NewsDay,NAFTA's impact on Long Island,"The North American Free Trade Agreement was a cause célèbre in the early 1990s.

Presidential candidate H. Ross Perot warned a ""giant sucking sound"" would be heard as U.S. jobs went to Mexico.

Proponents of the trade pact, which encompasses the United States, Canada and Mexico, predicted an enormous economic boost as cross-border commerce swelled.

On Long Island, where defense plants were already shrinking, the debate between unions opposed to the deal and business groups that favored it mirrored the national argument.

Now, two decades after NAFTA was implemented, experts said, it's clear on the Island and across the country that free trade had an enormous effect on specific workers and companies. But overall the impact has been subdued.

""NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said last year. ""The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.""

In Nassau and Suffolk counties, at least 3,134 people have received pink slips since 1994 because manufacturers shifted production to Mexico or Canada, according to a Newsday review of government documents certifying the workers were eligible for retraining funds because they had lost their jobs to trade. More than 85 percent of those positions went to Mexico.

During the same two-decade period, state data show local factory payrolls shrank by 33,800 jobs for a variety of reasons, ranging from trade to mergers to changing business patterns.

Exports from New York State businesses to Mexico more than tripled between 1993 and 2012 to $2.6 billion, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. (Long Island numbers weren't available.)

But that's peanuts compared with $15 billion in exports from New York to Canada in 2012, and the $1 trillion value of all goods and services produced in the state.

""Free trade is generally a positive to the economy,"" said John A. Rizzo, chief economist at the Long Island Association business group. ""But there are costs and benefits. It's not a slam dunk.""

Rizzo and others said 1994's NAFTA, the 1989 Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement and subsequent pacts have increased competition in the U.S. marketplace.

Prices have fallen on some goods and services, and the merchandise on store shelves is more varied. But certain domestic companies have struggled, and some have shifted work to lower-cost countries and terminated better-paid U.S. workers.

NAFTA changed everything for a Ronkonkoma-based garment maker and a young engineer in 1995, a year after the trade agreement went into effect.

Lakeland Industries Inc. has had great difficulty for years in finding seamstresses to produce its protective clothing used in industry, health care and emergency response. In the 1970s, it moved sewing jobs off Long Island to Alabama.

COULDN'T HIRE IN U.S.

Chief executive Christopher Ryan said NAFTA led to the opening of a plant in Mexico in 1995 that now employs 250 people. He said the money saved in labor costs went to buy new equipment for the Alabama plant and to boost hiring there as sales increased.

Lakeland has 150 workers in Alabama, 40 in Pennsylvania, 100 in Brazil and 1,100 in China. Eight people work at the Ronkonkoma headquarters.

""Everybody says, 'Oh, we are losing jobs to Mexico,' "" Ryan said. ""Believe me, we couldn't hire anybody in the United States to do sewing, and we still can't.""

Yet, Mexico offers more than reduced wage rates.

He said its proximity to the United States means lower shipping costs and quicker delivery than China can offer. Plus, products made in Mexico aren't subject to import taxes charged by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela because Mexico has free trade agreements with those nations, which the United States and China do not.

""We wouldn't be in business today without NAFTA, because we wouldn't have been competitive,"" said Ryan. ""Most of my competitors from the 1990s are now out of business.""

A CHANGE OF CAREERS

NAFTA helped to turn James J. Lillie's world upside down for a while in 1995-96.

The industrial engineer was laid off in August 1995 after more than seven years at Ademco, the maker of fire and security alarms then based in Syosset. He said he was among 65 people fired that summer day because of NAFTA and the company's drive to reduce its manufacturing costs.

""I was dumbfounded . . . It didn't make any sense, because I had gotten a promotion a few months earlier,"" said Lillie, who at the time was newly engaged to his wife, Donna.

Lillie soon landed a job at the Jolly Rancher candy factory in Denver but had been there less than three weeks when the owner announced plans to close a different plant and sell off another. In January 1996, Lillie eagerly started attending law school at St. John's University in Queens.

""NAFTA was a natural progression for the economy that needed to happen, even though I might have been a casualty of it,"" said Lillie, who at 49 is now a patent attorney in Ronkonkoma. ""In hindsight, the best thing that ever happened to me was for them to let me go, because it pushed me to change.""

His former employer, Ademco, and its successor, Honeywell Security in Melville, shed 917 local jobs by moving production to Mexico in the past 20 years, according to approved applications for the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program.

Ademco/Honeywell had the most NAFTA-related layoffs, followed by the 520 at Symbol Technologies in Bohemia and Holtsville, and 300 at Condor PC Power Supplies in Brentwood.

""These were good-paying jobs, the kind that you can support a family on,"" said Roger Clayman, executive director of the Long Island Federation of Labor. ""NAFTA has led to the decline of manufacturing on Long Island.""

Lisa Tyson, director of the Long Island Progressive Coalition, agreed, saying fewer jobs at factories and more at stores and other service businesses have caused an exodus from Nassau and Suffolk counties as people no longer have the earnings to pay mortgages and tax bills here.

The coalition, together with local unions, environmentalists and peace groups, have been demonstrating against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement between North America and nine countries including Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam.

A HISTORIC PACT

Twenty years ago, NAFTA was considered historic because it was the first trade deal between two developed nations and a developing one -- previous pacts were between developed nations only.

NAFTA's supporters said recently that it created many jobs in research and development, high-tech manufacturing and sales -- enough to offset the loss of low-skilled production jobs.

""We didn't get the big sucking sound that Ross Perot was talking about, and to the extent that we lost jobs, it was not just because of free trade but a lot of reasons,"" said Gary Sazer, a Mineola attorney who co-founded the 1990s advocacy group Long Islanders for NAFTA.

Exports from New York State businesses to Canada and Mexico climbed 107 percent between 1993 and 2012 to $18 billion, according to the latest federal statistics. Data on imports wasn't available for the same period, but in 2012 they totaled $19 billion in Canadian goods and $3 billion in Mexican goods.

The 31-county metropolitan region that includes Long Island trades about $31.5 billion in goods with Canada and Mexico each year, said Joseph Parilla, a research analyst at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. The region placed first in trade with Canada and fourth with Mexico among U.S. metro areas.

The New York region's biggest import, in dollar terms, is energy, and its biggest export is pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

Anticipating more sales of its rapid tests for HIV and syphilis to Mexico and other foreign countries, Chembio Diagnostics Inc. has boosted its Medford workforce to 210 and recently rented additional space in Holbrook.

Mexico accounted for less than 5 percent of the company's sales of $29.6 million in 2013. But the country is expected to grow in significance now that a combination HIV-syphilis test has been approved for sale.

""We've been very successful in providing our products to a number of public health initiatives in Mexico,"" said Lawrence A. Siebert, who retired last week as Chembio's chief executive. ""It's a very large country with huge needs . . . We're anticipating a very strong year with Mexico.""",16/03/2014
NewsDay,Nassau hospital's call to test injected patients seen as opportunity,"For public health officials, the 4,247 letters South Nassau Communities Hospital recently sent to patients recommending they get tested for hepatitis B and C and HIV after the possible misuse of insulin pens are both disheartening and an opportunity.

""We're aggressively following up after this episode and we're hoping that people notice and ask: 'Is that the right way to do it?' "" said Mary Beth Wenger. She is the state Department of Health's representative for the One & Only Campaign, a drive to promote safe injection practices led by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a national coalition of advocates and medical groups.

The campaign was started in 2008 after hundreds of cases of hepatitis B and C nationwide were linked to unsafe injection practices. That included Dr. Harvey Finkelstein of Plainview, a pain management doctor who in 2004 was observed reusing syringes in multidose vials, causing at least one transmission of hepatitis C.

In 2008, Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow sent out 840 letters to diabetes patients urging them to get tested after nurses reported hearing of other nurses using insulin pens on more than one patient.

Something similar happened at South Nassau, where a nurse was heard saying it was all right to reuse the reservoir that contains insulin -- but not the needle -- in more than one patient, the Oceanside hospital said.

The hospital has said the risk of infection is ""extremely low.""

Because of potential backflow of blood into the open cartridge after injection, using a pen on multiple patients could expose them to infection, studies have found.

The campaign is trying to make that clear, and its message is straightforward:

""Needles and syringes are single use devices. They should not be used for more than one patient or reused to draw up additional medication. Do not administer medications from a single-dose vial or IV bag to multiple patients. Limit the use of multidose vials and dedicate them to a single patient whenever possible.""

Nevertheless, unsafe injection practices remain a problem.

Since 2001, at least 49 outbreaks have occurred because of contaminated injections, the CDC reported last year. Twenty-one of those involved transmission of hepatitis B or C; the other 28 included outbreaks of bacterial infections. They also resulted in about 150,000 patients who had to be notified to undergo testing, the CDC said.

Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued an alert systemwide after the report of insulin pen misuse at its Buffalo hospital. Of 395 patients tested, 18 were found to have hepatitis, a virus that affects the liver.

And a 2010 survey of 5,500 health care professionals found that 1 percent said they reused syringes and 6 percent reused single-dose vials.

Asked why the problem persists, Dr. Melissa Schaefer, a CDC medical officer, said: ""We don't feel there is an acceptable reason for this. There is no acceptable reason for unsafe practices.""

Wenger said she has heard a range of reasons. ""In some cases, it may be poor training or lack of training or you hear 'that's what we learned in school, but when you get into the work world, it's different,' "" she said. ""We all know the time pressures, and I think sometimes corners may get cut.""

But for both, an episode like South Nassau's presents a teachable moment. ""As unfortunate as these events are, it's important to learn from others' mistakes,"" Schaefer said.

THREE QUESTIONS TO ASK

The One & Only Campaign urges patients to ask their health care providers the following before an injection:

-- Will there be a new needle, new syringe and a new vial for this procedure or injection?

-- Can you tell me how you prevent the spread of infections in your facility?

-- What steps are you taking to keep me safe?

NewsDay,South Nassau Hospital flooded with calls on infection risk,"South Nassau Communities Hospital said Wednesday it has been flooded with phone calls since reports Tuesday that the facility has sent letters to more than 4,200 patients recommending that they be tested for hepatitis B and C and HIV because of the risk of infection from an insulin pen.

""We've been inundated with calls, as you might expect,"" hospital spokesman Damian Becker said.

Becker said that as of 2:35 p.m. Wednesday the hospital had booked 115 appointments and returned an additional 70 calls -- and had more to return.

Becker apologized if people had been put on hold and encouraged them to keep trying. ""We're pounding away at it as best we can,"" he said. ""We take this very seriously.""

South Nassau is offering free and confidential testing for those notified. To arrange a test, call 516-208-0029.

In the Feb. 22 letter, the Oceanside hospital said the patients may have received insulin from an insulin pen cartridge -- not the pen's needle, which is used only once -- that could have been used on more than one patient.

Those diabetics potentially exposed were patients between March 2011 and January 2014, Becker said.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Patients who may have been exposed within the past six months may need to be retested if they test negative, Becker said. ""This is because it may take up to six months for the test to become positive after an exposure, and we are recommending this out of an abundance of caution,"" he said.

An insulin pen is a pre-filled syringe that can be used multiple times -- but on only one patient. Because of potential backflow of a patient's blood into the pen cartridge after injection, using a pen on more than one patient could expose them to blood-borne infections.

Becker said no one was observed reusing the insulin pen cartridge on more than one patient, but a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so. That triggered a report to the state Department of Health.

George Hebert, 69, of Freeport, said he got a letter Wednesday from the hospital. A diabetic, he said he went to South Nassau after he broke his arm Dec. 30 and was released Jan. 4.

Frantic about possibly passing a disease on to his wife, who helps him test his blood twice daily, he said it took four phone calls Wednesday before he got through to the hospital. ""And I still don't have an appointment,"" he said. ""I will be worried until I know I'm not going to infect my wife.""

Evelyn McKnight of Fremont, Neb., a national advocate for safe needle use, said New York has been a leader in proper needle use, and the problem is with health care providers.

Becker said Tuesday the hospital, which is sending the letters out in phases, has received about 200 phone calls so far. The last letters should be received by March 17, Becker said.

It will take patients about two weeks to receive test results, he said.

The hospital said it has since banned the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use vials.

The state Department of Health said that last year three health facilities reported potential insulin pen re-use: two state-regulated facilities and the Veterans Administration's medical center in Buffalo.

South Nassau is offering free and confidential blood testing and has set up a dedicated telephone line for those patients notified. To arrange a test, call 516-208-0029.

Insulin pen misuse is not uncommon.

In May 2008, Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow notified 840 patients that nurses may have been using insulin pens on multiple patients.

In 2009, following reports of improper use of insulin pens in hospitals, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert reminding health care workers that insulin pens are meant for use on a single patient only.

In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that ""in spite of this alert, there have been continuing reports of patients placed at risk through inappropriate reuse and sharing of insulin pens,"" and it put out a clinical reminder on their proper use.

NewsDay,Sanders: What Arizona and Uganda have in common,"The state of Arizona and the East African nation of Uganda don't have much in common.

But there is one area in which the two are remarkably similar: They both tend to have backward, bigoted political leadership.

That has never been more evident than in what we have witnessed in the last couple of weeks, during which the Ugandan president signed into law an anti-gay bill that included life in prison for certain acts, and the Arizona legislature sent an anti-gay bill to its governor that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against homosexuals.

In each case supporters of the legislation invoked religion as the basis of their prejudicial action.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, after threats of economic boycotts and the possibility of losing the Super Bowl next year, vetoed the bill, but not before the state once again had cast itself as a bastion of intolerance. There are other recent examples of that which I'll get to later.

Pressure from other foreign countries and the United Nations, including withdrawal of economic aid, did not keep Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni from signing a bill that would send a person to prison for life if found guilty of ""aggravated homosexuality"" - having sex with minors, ""serial offenders"" or a person infected with HIV having sex, even if consensual and protected.

The bill, which originally included the death penalty, outlaws same-sex relations outright, but also calls for jail time for those who aid or counsel homosexuals.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Since 2009, after some American Christian evangelists warned Ugandan leaders about the ills of homosexuality, there has been a push to toughen the anti-gay laws there, with some in parliament pledging to get a bill passed ""in time for Christmas"" of 2012. They didn't make that deadline, but did pass it Dec. 23, 2013, and Museveni signed it Feb. 24.

A $90 million loan to Uganda for its health system has been suspended by the World Bank, and Norway and Denmark have said they would withhold funding because of the law, according to Reuters news service.

You may think I'm overreaching to compare Arizona's actions to the homophobia being exhibited in the African nation, but I'm not. In some ways what legislators there did was to use the guise of Christianity as a way to codify discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation.

Proponents of the legislation claimed it was not anti-gay, but a way to allow Christians to practice religious freedom by refusing to do business with those whose lifestyles conflict with the business owners' faith.

Sixty years ago, owners of businesses in the South made basically the same argument, claiming their rights were being violated if they could not refuse service to blacks based on long-held, and sometimes Bible-referenced, beliefs.

Arizona's intolerance is well documented. Its series of an anti-immigration laws, particularly the one that legalizes racial profiling, speak clearly to that. Those acts have caused many groups to avoid traveling to or doing business in that state.

One would have thought the state would have learned from its experience 25 years ago when its leaders, and later the electorate, refused to recognize the Martin Luther King holiday. In addition to losing major conventions and tourists, Arizona lost the 1993 Super Bowl when the National Football League moved it to Pasadena, Calif.

After passage of this most recent legislation, the economic dominoes began to fall quickly, and the NFL began to look at alternatives for next year's Super Bowl, which is set to be played in Glendale, Ariz.

In this latest show of discrimination, Arizona leaders permitted their economic interest to trump their bigotry.

But understand that the governor's veto, while stopping enactment of an unjust law, will not erase the stain that Arizona carries because of its repeated demonstrations of intolerance.

NewsDay,Longtime critic named to head NYC's HRA,"Mayor Bill de Blasio Friday picked a longtime foe of New York City government's poverty policies and onetime political rival to head its main welfare agency.

Steven Banks, now the chief lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, will lead the $9 billion Human Resources Administration, which serves more than 3 million New Yorkers. The agency doles out temporary cash assistance, Medicaid, food stamps and other programs for the old, infirm and those with HIV/AIDS, enforces child-support orders, and more.

""I've been at the Legal Aid Society through now five mayoral administrations, and this is the first one I'm not bringing a lawsuit against,"" Banks said yesterday at City Hall, eliciting a hearty chuckle from de Blasio.

Banks, 56, was among three appointments announced Friday. Nisha Agarwal, 36, was named to lead the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs. Lorraine Grillo, 64, will remain head of the School Construction Authority. First named in 2010 by Mayor Michael Bloomberg she will continue to get $192,528 a year; Agarwal, $192,198; and Banks, $205,180.

Banks battled the Ed Koch administration so destitute families would be entitled to city shelter at least on par with criminals. He castigated David Dinkins' City Hall for keeping homeless people in welfare hotels. He fought a Rudy Giuliani policy to send children to foster care if their shelter-seeking parents refuse work assignments. He railed against a Bloomberg-era database tracking the intimate details of millions of poor individuals.

And in 2001, he lost a Brooklyn City Council race -- to de Blasio.

Agarwal, a daughter of immigrants, will help spearhead a municipal ID card for city residents who are not in the country legally. The program is set to debut later this year, and the administration hopes the card will appeal to all New Yorkers by offering bonuses such as business discounts.

NewsDay,Opinion: The Taliban are winning the war on polio,"NEW YORK - This week's tragic reappearance of polio in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, after 13 years, poses serious questions about the future of health in the country following the scheduled withdrawal of United States military personnel at the end of 2014. Without their military escorts and protection, humanitarian and non-governmental aid organizations are expected to draw down foreign personnel as well.

Although the polio vaccine is safe, vaccination remains a sensitive topic in the region and aid workers face a mounting wave of cultural challenges. Some militants believe the common misconception that vaccinations are against Islamic law or are administered as part of a broader American plot to sterilize children or infect them with HIV. Taliban in Pakistan have been attacking polio workers and their security teams since it was revealed in 2011 the CIA used a fake Hepatitis B vaccine campaign in Abbottabad as part of an attempt to obtain blood samples from Osama bin Laden's children in order to confirm the al-Qaida chief's location.

Despite the Pakistani government's efforts to provide police protection, at least 31 polio vaccination workers have been killed in Pakistan since July 2012. (Police and security personnel working with them have also been shot at, wounded and killed.) These attacks, unfortunately, have had their desired effect. Along with systemic problems in supply chains and personnel management, the intimidation and violence have increasingly led mothers to opt out of all kinds of vaccines, and have stymied health efforts; outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, have increased. And as a result, polio remains unchecked in several provinces, particularly in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.

The 3-year-old Afghan girl named Sakina who was diagnosed with polio in Kabul comes from one of these tribal communities, the Kuchi nomadic tribe. Although her family currently resides in east Kabul, they regularly cross the border between the two countries. According to Kaneshka Baktash, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health, it is likely that Sakina contracted the virus while in Pakistan. The strain of polio she has is identical to the one circulating in Pakistan, further evidence that the case was imported. Sakina is paralyzed as a result of the disease; her family brought her to Pakistan where she is receiving treatment.

The family's nomadic lifestyle may have played a role in the young girl's illness. Baktash suggested the family may have been away from home when vaccination teams visited their neighborhood in Kabul. The Kuchis in Kabul, such as Sakina's family, live in a poorer district of the capital where there is no running water. The polio virus can live in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract without causing disease, and is primarily spread via feces. This means that the disease can be passed through sewers, polluted drinking water, and unclean hands. Oral administration of polio vaccine is the only way to ensure immunization of the entire GI tract; it is therefore preferred to use drops, versus polio shots. Although shots do give a stronger immunity to the individual child, the oral vaccine protects the public. Even though Kabul has the best sewage and water systems in the country, when a sewage system is contaminated, the only option to prevent outbreaks is mass vaccinations, and mass vaccination campaigns require a strong, well-coordinated public health response.

When Israel found samples of live polio virus after routine sewage tests in May 2013, authorities quickly launched a comprehensive response. The strain, originally discovered in Rahat, also matched the strain currently circulating in Pakistan, demonstrating how easily the disease can spread across borders. Subsequent tests showed polio in the sewer systems in several parts of the country including Jerusalem as recently as September 2013. But starting in August 2013, the oral polio vaccine was administered to 980,000 Israeli children under 9 years old, or 79 percent of the children in that age group. Because of this seven-month coordinated public health effort, there were no human cases of the disease, and recent samples from the same sewage treatment plant have tested negative for polio.

The ongoing outbreak of polio in Syria, on the other hand, demonstrates how quickly polio, measles and other vaccine-preventable disease can make comebacks when routine vaccinations are disrupted. Despite not reporting a single case since 1999, Syria recorded 17 cases of polio in October 2013; this strain is also closely related to the one found in Pakistan. International organizations have been trying to reach and vaccinate these vulnerable populations in Syria, but their efforts have been continuously stymied. Just last month, the World Health Organization and UNICEF condemned fighting in the city of al-Raqaa for interrupting a polio immunization campaign. Conflict zones in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa are rife with vaccination disruptions and outbreaks that are impeding global progress toward eradication.

The global health community is focused on polio because it is possible to eradicate the virus -- an achievement reached for only one human pathogen to date: smallpox. But the campaign to eliminate polio is revealing larger health system issues that exist worldwide. The infrastructure and funding behind the global polio effort far exceeds that supporting any other childhood contagious disease -- save, perhaps, HIV in Africa. Where polio efforts can fail, all of the less well-funded, weaker achievements in health are also in peril.

Time will tell if this case of polio in Kabul is a harbinger of grim times ahead. Achievements in health have been made in Afghanistan since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001. The total number of polio cases dropped from 120 in 2000, to just 14 in 2013. Other health indicators have also been improving, in no small part because of huge U.S. investment in the country. USAID has spent approximately $15 billion in Afghanistan since 2002, and $113.9 million on improving health outcomes in 2011 alone.

The results speak for themselves: Between 2004 and 2010, the infant mortality rate fell from 115 deaths per 1,000 live births to 77 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the estimated life expectancy rose from 42 years to 62 years.

But these advances in health outcomes are fragile, and continued investment is needed to keep up these gains. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative estimates that $156.82 million in funding is needed between 2013 and 2015 to eradicate the disease from Afghanistan alone. Maintaining forward movement in the improvement of health must be a key part of all agreements related to the withdrawal of U.S. military and government personnel, United Nations agencies, and NGOs. Otherwise, there is the real possibility that Taliban plots to obstruct polio vaccinations could derail many hard-fought gains in global health and development.

The children of Afghanistan must not pay the price for political squabbles both between Kabul and Washington, D.C., and inside the country itself.

NewsDay,Cooper: Require all to get drug education,"'Heroin. I am using heroin.""

I heard that admission from my 17-year-old son nearly two decades ago.

He is 36 now -- and surprisingly still alive. Many opiate addicts like him die before age 30. His wife died at 28 of an overdose, nine months after their wedding.

Despite love, rehabs, support, tough love, jail, and the loss of his wife, my son would not -- could not -- stop. Powerless to help him, I focused instead on the field of addiction.

As an addiction counselor at an acute care hospital in Manhattan, I spoke to patients as they lay suffering from gastritis, pancreatitis, broken bones, heart and kidney failure, lung disease, and HIV/AIDS.

I frequently found the underlying issue to be addiction -- alcohol, heroin, crystal meth, pills, crack, cocaine, even spray cleaner for computers. As I tried to help those patients, and now as I work with families and addicts, I find that society too often views the addicted as outcasts -- deadbeats who ""brings this on themselves.""

Philip Seymour Hoffman, the award-winning actor who died last week of an apparent heroin overdose, was not a deadbeat. And neither is my son -- who is doing very well thanks to his maturity and the structure he has in his life.

With the knowledge that comes from treating addiction and the personal angst I suffered until my son became sober, I learned that prevention is key, making sure the door to the first use is never opened. On the other side of the door, not a day will pass without fear and struggle.

When I speak to audiences about addiction, at times I sense the collective thought of some who think ""not-my-kid."" That's shortsighted: Addiction has touched scores of families across our country regardless of education, race, gender or economic status.

Mandatory education -- in schools, businesses, churches or health care facilities -- is paramount. It would raise awareness, create understanding and shed light on the shame of addiction.

NewsDay,Gabila's: Replacement knish machine has landed,"The end of America's fried-knish drought is in sight.

A custom-made machine that produces the square dumplings arrived Thursday afternoon at the Gabila's Knishes factory in Copiague, a company official said, almost five months after the original was damaged in a fire.

Stacey Ziskin Gabay, executive vice president and general counsel, said the factory has become a hive of activity since the arrival of the machine, which makes the product accounting for about three-quarters of the company's revenue.

""It's very intense right now,"" she said.

Ziskin Gabay said the company needs clearance from the Copiague fire marshal before it can put the machine through a dry run.

When can fried knish fans expect the first products to hit retail outlets?

That probably won't happen until ""some point next week,"" she said.

The knish machine's arrival follows months of dashed hopes after the company pointed toward resumed production in November, December and then January.

The Sept. 26 fire prompted a media frenzy as fried knish lovers bemoaned the loss of the nation's sole large-scale producer.

Until the fire, Gabila's made about 13 million fried knishes a year and distributed them through warehouse clubs, supermarkets, restaurants and pushcarts.

Once the impact of the fire became apparent, the 93-year-old company housed in a nondescript 10,000-square-foot factory became national news. Ziskin Gabay appeared on TV news shows, and headline writers rolled out Yiddishisms like ""kvetch,"" ""nosh"" and ""oy vey"" in the face of the shortage of the simple dish popularized by Jewish immigrants in New York City in the early 1900s.

Gabila's was founded by Bella Gabay, who cooked the knishes in her Lower East Side kitchen, and her husband, Elia Gabay, who sold them from a pushcart. By 1928 business was booming, and the Gabays moved production to a factory in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 2006 the company left Brooklyn and moved to the factory in Copiague.

Though the square, fried knishes stuffed with potatoes, spinach and other fillings are the company's flagship product, Gabila's also makes round, baked knishes, blintzes, potato pancakes and other dishes.",06/02/2014
NewsDay,Long Island briefs,"RIVERHEAD

Sober house plan draws much support

A proposal to open a sober house in a building across from Riverhead's Town Hall drew nearly 20 people to Tuesday's town board meeting, almost all of them speaking in favor of the plan.

Most, including Greg Conrad of Riverhead, spoke of problems with addiction and how it harms families, and praised Mainstream House and its founder, Robert Hartman, for turning around their lives.

Hartman, a former potato farmer who runs several other sober houses in Riverhead, is seeking a special permit to allow a now-closed building at 755 E. Main St. -- originally built as a house and later rezoned as an office building -- to again be used as a residence. He plans to run it as a seven-bedroom sober house.

""It's a family atmosphere that is needed. This house would be given a real meaning once again,"" he said.

Only one man spoke against the plan, saying it could increase crime downtown.

In contrast, Larry Oxman, who owns and rents several downtown buildings, said he supported the proposal. ""I don't see any kind of detriment at all. I would be happy to show property next door,"" he said.

The Riverhead Town Board kept its hearing open for written comments until Feb. 14, and Supervisor Sean Walter said the special permit request would come up for a vote at the regular town board meeting on Feb. 19. He said he expects the board to approve it.

GLEN COVE

Hearing on cleanup at Superfund site

The state Department of Environmental Conservation has scheduled a second meeting to hear public comments about a proposed $5.5 million amended remedy to address contamination at the Powers Chemco site under the state's Superfund Program.

The meeting has been set for Feb. 13 at 7 p.m. at Glen Cove City Hall.

The agency will accept written comments through Feb. 17 about the plans for the property at 71 Charles St.

The DEC is proposing to remove about 10,000 cubic yards of contaminated subsurface soils and replace it with clean fill, followed by chemical oxidation of residual contaminated groundwater.

After a 1991 cleanup, some contaminants remained, including toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, methyl ethyl ketone and benzene. Groundwater samples also detected several metals, including arsenic, chromium, lead and mercury.

The plan can be reviewed at the Glen Cove Public Library or at content.govdelivery.com /attachments/NYSDEC/2014 /02/04/file_attachments /267935/PowersChemco SecondPublicMeeting.pdf

ROSLYN

Meeting on plans to address fouled well

The Roslyn Water District plans to hold a public meeting next week on its plans to build a facility to address contamination in one of its wells.

The meeting is scheduled for 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Park at East Hills' Theater Building, 209 Harbor Hill Rd., East Hills.

The district last week agreed to hold the meeting at the request of the North Hempstead Town Board, after a three-hour public hearing during which the district presented its plans to address the Freon 22 contamination at its well on Diana's Trail in Roslyn Estates.

The district had asked the town board to approve a $20.9 million bond measure for 11 projects, including building an air stripper that would remove the Freon from the water and send it into the air.

District officials said the bond needed to be approved last week to begin construction on the air stripper in time for the shuttered contaminated well to be back on line in the summer, when demand for water peaks.

But residents in the district argued against the cleanup plan, citing concerns about environmental impacts and what they characterized as a lack of communication about the project from the district.

The town board, which is the only entity that can bond on behalf of the district, decided to put off its decision on the bond proposal until its Feb. 25 meeting, giving the district time to meet with residents.

The Roslyn Water District serves about 5,800 residential and commercial customers.

EAST MEADOW

Parking problem

to be discussed

Daytime residents-only parking permits on about a dozen streets near the Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow are to be discussed at a Town of Hempstead public hearing on Feb. 18, the town board has announced.

The volume of residential complaints about a lack of available parking in the area has steadily risen since the hospital closed a parking garage in mid-2011.

The hearing, at 10:30 a.m., moves forward following a state law sponsored by state Sen. Kemp Hannon (R-Garden City) and Assemb. Thomas McKevitt (R-East Meadow), passed last month, allowing such permits for two areas, including all or parts of Roosevelt Avenue, First Street, Second Street, Third Street, Franklin Avenue and Nottingham Road; and Florence Court, Jane Court and Erma Drive. Town spokesman Michael Deery said restrictive time differences were because of the preferences of most residents in each of the two areas.

AMITYVILLE

Free HIV testing offered tomorrow

Free HIV testing will be available in Amityville tomorrow as part of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.

The AIDS awareness event is sponsored by the Long Island Association for AIDS Care Inc., and is being hosted by Walgreens. LIAAC, a nonprofit based in Hauppauge, plans to have representatives on site offering free HIV testing, as well as blood pressure checks, flu shots and other health screening tests.

National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day was first observed in 1999. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African-Americans are the racial/ethnic group most affected by HIV and accounted for 44 percent of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing only 12 percent to 14 percent of the U.S. population.

The testing is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Walgreens at 275 Broadway. For more information, contact LIAAC at 877-865-4222.

RIVERHEAD

Town board hires law firm to aid borrowing

Saying that Riverhead could face a multimillion- dollar shortfall next year when the town's reserve fund runs out, the town board has hired a law firm to take the steps needed to borrow up to $6 million to keep that from happening.

""I hope we don't have to do it,"" said Supervisor Sean Walter. ""But I have to have a budget [for 2015] by Sept. 30.""

For the past several years, Riverhead has been able to use about $3 million a year generated from the sale of property at its Enterprise Park at Calverton and from options to buy land there as a way of holding tax levy increases to the state-mandated 2 percent cap.

But that fund runs out this year, and Riverhead could face a high double-digit tax hike next year unless it finds the money to replace it.

Walter said that there is a chance the town can sell off some of its land at EPCAL once environmental and planning studies are completed, and he held out hope that a proposal to sell or lease 90 acres for a solar power plant could be approved as early as next month. But, he added, it is important to be able to borrow money if those plans fall through.

The town board on Tuesday, acting under its power as the Community Development Agency, voted unanimously to hire Harris Beach PLLC, a law firm with offices throughout the tri-state area, to prepare required loan documents. Any money borrowed could only be used to keep 2015 and 2016 tax increases under the 2 percent cap.

BROOKHAVEN

Black history event to honor students

About 70 Brookhaven high school students will be honored for their academic achievement at a black history ceremony Friday at Town Hall. Brookhaven's Black History Commission is sponsoring the annual event, which will celebrate civil rights and bridging the gaps between older and younger African-Americans.

This year's theme is ""A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins With a Single Step,"" honoring in part the late Nelson Mandela. All students being recognized have a 3.0 or above grade-point average and will have the opportunity to recite a poem or give remarks about their academic success. They represent school districts such as William Floyd, Bellport, Longwood and Centereach, town officials said.

M. Jamal Colson, a William Paca Middle School assistant principal, and an author and founding member of the South Shore Scholars Association, is the featured guest.

Leah Jefferson, chairwoman of the history commission, said Colson's 2013 book, ""Raising Scholars from Infancy to Adulthood: Preparing Our Children for College and Demolishing Prison Walls,"" is an inspiration to students. The program will feature African-influenced performances, drum playing and choir singing. It is scheduled to be held from 6 to 9 p.m.

LONG BEACH

Contract OKd to remove 1,000 trees

Long Beach approved a contract to have a Brooklyn firm remove trees that died due to salt water intrusion because of superstorm Sandy.

Dragonetti Brothers Nursery and Landscaping, of East New York, will be paid $638,000 to remove about 1,000 trees, the City Council voted on Tuesday night.

The vote was unanimous, with one council member not present.

The ruined trees are located on city streets and rights-of- way and ""pose potential hazards,"" according to a resolution the council approved on Tuesday.

The city will also pay LiRo Engineers of Syosset $14 per tree to conduct an inventory of trees on residential streets and right-of-way areas.

LiRo also worked on the city's boardwalk replacement project. That project is finished.

The Town of Babylon Parks Department said Tuesday that it was seeking family-friendly photos for use in this year's parks and recreation guide, which it usually releases in the spring.

The photos should have been taken at a town park or recreational activity, such as a beach, pool, day camp, swimming lesson or concert.

The town said that participants should include the name of anyone in the photo, where they live, as well as the town park where the photo was taken.

NewsDay,"De Blasio won't ban NYPD, FDNY from St. Pat's parade","Bill de Blasio on Tuesday rejected a call by gay rights activists and other elected officials to ban uniformed New York City workers from marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade, saying they have ""the right"" to participate.

However, de Blasio said he would not join the March 17 parade, whose organizers have enforced a long-standing ban on openly gay groups. He noted he has declined to march in the past, adding, ""I simply disagree with the organizers of that parade in their exclusion of some individuals in this city.""

The mayor was responding to an open letter addressed to him and signed by Public Advocate Letitia James, State Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan) and groups including Stonewall Democrats of New York City. The letter said the presence of uniformed police officers and firefighters ""sends a clear signal to LGBTQ New Yorkers that these personnel, who are charged with serving and protecting all New Yorkers, do not respect the lives or safety of LGBT people.""

De Blasio said he would not order a ban.

""I respect the right of our city workers to march in uniform, period,"" de Blasio said when asked about the letter during a news conference at City Hall.

Former mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani -- both supportive of gay rights -- have marched in past St. Patrick's Day parades. De Blasio said he would participate in other events celebrating Irish heritage that day.

Sean Barry, executive director of Vocal-NY, a group run by people affected by HIV and AIDS, said he appreciates that de Blasio is declining to march but called the permitting of workers representing the city to do so ""insulting.""

Barry said workers participating out of uniform on their own time have a ""free speech right"" to do so.

NewsDay,News 12 anchor Judy Martin found dead,"News 12 Long Island anchor Judy Martin was remembered by colleagues Saturday as a tenacious, award-winning journalist and ""free spirit"" who spoke often about balancing her career and personal life.

Stunning station employees, Martin died suddenly in her Halesite home on Friday night. She was 49.

Suffolk County police, who were called to the home at 7:30 p.m., said criminality is not suspected.

As of Saturday night, the cause of death had not been determined. Martin's cousin Philip Gallagher said she died of natural causes.

Martin last appeared on the anchor desk Thursday night. She had been scheduled to anchor the 5 p.m. Friday broadcast but didn't show up, raising concerns, the station said.

A New York Emmy Award winner, Martin began working at Woodbury-based News 12 in 1988. During her 25-year broadcast news career, she covered a long list of major stories, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the 1990 crash of Avianca Flight 52 on Long Island.

""She was an aggressive reporter"" who wanted to know and explore the world around her, said Patrick Dolan, news director of News 12.

""She was a free spirit as a person, and I think that quality carried over into her natural sense of curiosity as she would tackle an assignment,"" he said.

During her career, she also worked for Marketplace Report, National Public Radio, CNBC Business Radio, World Vision Report and BBC Radio 3, according to her website, worklifenation.com, where she wrote about balancing professional and home life. An accredited yoga teacher, she gave workshops on stress management and released a CD on meditation.

The day she died, Martin tweeted a dozen times on a variety of subjects, sharing links to articles on careers, leadership and the Super Bowl.

Alan Goodman, executive producer at News 12, described Martin, whom he knew for about 25 years, as a hard-nosed reporter and ""a very well-prepared anchor.""

""She was a very empathetic person in general,"" he said. ""She just loved doing stories about people.""

Colleagues said Martin, who never married, was involved in women's issues and volunteered at hospices. A 2000 Newsday profile on Martin said she served on the board of directors for River Fund, a Florida-based volunteer organization serving people with HIV and AIDS.

Martin was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Baldwin, where she went to high school. She earned her undergraduate degree in communications and broadcast journalism from the New York Institute of Technology-Old Westbury.

Her aunt, Natalie Gallagher, of North Plainfield, N.J., said Martin was a ""beautiful, caring woman"" who made everyone laugh.

Martin's sister, Mary Martin Loder, was traveling to Long Island from Florida Saturday after learning of the death, family members said. Other survivors include her parents, John and Marietta Martin, of Long Island.

NewsDay,Gates optimistic on future of world's poor,"Philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates pitched an optimistic future for the world's poor and sick in their sixth annual letter Tuesday, arguing passionately against three myths they say hurt efforts to bring people out of poverty, save lives and improve living conditions.

In their yearly letter, which in the past has focused exclusively on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's annual activities, the co-chairmen of the world's largest charitable foundation seek to dispel beliefs that poor countries are doomed to stay poor, that foreign aid is wasteful and that saving lives will cause overpopulation.

""All three reflect a dim view of the future, one that says the world isn't improving but staying poor and sick, and getting overcrowded,"" Bill Gates writes in the 16-page letter. ""We're going to make the opposite case, that the world is getting better, and that in two decades it will be better still.""

Bill Gates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, says GDP per capita figures, adjusted for inflation to 2005 dollars, show that many countries such as China, India, Brazil and even Botswana that were once considered poor now have growing economies.

And in Africa, a place he says is all too often dismissed as hopeless, life expectancy has risen since the 1960s despite the HIV epidemic. Also, more children are going to school, and fewer people are hungry.

""I am optimistic enough about this that I am willing to make a prediction,"" he said. ""By 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world.""

Gates also argues against claims that foreign aid is wasteful because it is too expensive, it is stolen by corrupt officials receiving it or countries who receive it become dependent on it.

He says that in Norway, the world's most generous donor of foreign aid, the amount of its budget that goes to foreign aid is only 3 percent. In the United States it's less than 1 percent, or about $30 billion per year, of which $11 billion goes to vaccines, bed nets and other health causes.

Measles vaccinations, eradicating smallpox, controlling tuberculosis in China and a plan to eliminate polio in Latin America are all public health efforts achieved with aid funding.

""Health aid is a phenomenal investment,"" he writes. ""When I look at how many fewer children are dying than 30 years ago, and how many people are living longer and healthier lives, I get quite optimistic about the future,"" Gates writes.

His wife, Melinda, wrote a section of the letter disputing that saving lives worldwide will lead to overpopulation. She points to countries such as Brazil where both child mortality and birthrates have declined. When more children survive, she says, parents have smaller families.

NewsDay,Purity Labs Will Launch New Vitamin D Blood Spot Testing in 2014,"A revolutionary Blood Spot Testing Kit will be released by Purity Labs in the new year; providing an easy way to test a person's vitamin D status.

Vitamin D insufficiency affects as many as half of the U.S. population. Researchers in almost every medical discipline are finding that vitamin D may have a role in preventing, mitigating or treating disease. Conversely, researchers say that vitamin D deficiency may cause a wide range of health problems. Because of this, a person knowing his/her vitamin D status is of the utmost importance.

Purity Laboratories, Inc. (Purity), a 45-year-old environmental and clinical testing laboratory in Oregon, will launch its new blood spot test for vitamin D levels in the body early next year.

Purity’s blood spot testing is an easy, minimally invasive test. The patient will prick their finger and transfer blood from their finger onto a testing strip. The strip will then be sent back to Purity where it will be analyzed for the patient’s vitamin D status. The test will look at both vitamin D-2 and vitamin D-3 levels, the two most important types of vitamin D in humans. This is a fantastic option for patients who are unable to receive testing in the traditional doctors office setting; including children, the elderly and those who are homebound.

Robert Guthrie introduced blood spot testing in 1963 and it has been used around the world to test infants for phenylketonuria. This was due to the fact that a blood draw was not realistic for babies. Blood spot testing has now been expanded to include testing for vitamin D, hormone levels, hypothyroidism, HIV and many others.

Purity’s blood spot kit contains all the tools necessary to perform the test. It includes instructions on how to take the test, two lancets, a spot saver card, an alcohol prep pad, a surgical sponge and a latex free bandage. A requisition form and pre-paid return envelope are also included in the kit. When the test is complete it is placed into the pre-paid envelope along with the test requisition form and mailed back to Purity.

More information including pricing and how to order the test will be coming soon.

NewsDay,"Visage Sculpture, Premiere Cosmetic Clinic of Boston, Now Offers Botox and Dysport to Treat Migraines","Migraine is a complex medical problem. With proper diagnosis Botox is an effective treatment.

Visage Sculpture, cosmetic clinic dedicated to non-surgical face shaping, has always had a list of medical services. Among them was the treatment of HIV related face wasting, TMJ, excessive sweating, and consequences of facial nerve paralysis. In addition to all those valuable services treating migraines is now added to the list.

Botox and Dysport are used for relaxing dynamic lines of the forehead and brows. Often patients have reported positive “side effect” after a treatment-improvement, and often resolution, of migraines. Masha Banar, Board Certified Physician Associate and director of Visage Sculpture, then decided to offer this treatment for patients who suffer from this very common problem.

“Before proceeding with the treatment patient has to be diagnosed properly” Banar says. “Migraines have many etiologies: I have seen a patient recently with 2 different types of headaches, one type I was able to help with Botox as it was related to muscle strain; and the second type of headache was misdiagnosed for years-she was prescribed a strong anti-depressant medication by her Physician for something that turned out to be a chronic sinus infection resulting in sinus headache.”

Besides the muscles of the forehead and brows, Banar often treats muscles of the temples and head that cause headache when in spasm of strain. Results last about four months and can last longer when procedure is repeated.

Complimentary consultation can be scheduled by calling at (617)795-0201 or via e-mail. Office is located at 31 Channing Street, Newton Corner, MA 02458.

NewsDay,7 great books from 2013 you might have missed,"Anyone who has spent time browsing the ""new releases"" tables of their local bookstore -- or lost an hour web-surfing Amazon.com -- knows just how many books are published in the course of a year: a lot. (Some might say too darn many.) Inevitably, certain titles are singled out for a chorus of praise while others quietly disappear. Before looking ahead to 2014, Newsday asked some of its regular reviewers to single out a book that deserved more acclaim than it got in the crowded literary marketplace.

1. FAREWELL, FRED VOODOO: A Letter From Haiti, by Amy Wilentz (Simon & Schuster, $16 paper)

Nearly four years after the devastating earthquake in that country, Haiti has once again slipped off the front pages. This account of life in the literal ruins of this natural disaster -- which was followed by a serious cholera outbreak -- is a vital, fascinating corrective. Wilentz, who writes for The New Yorker and The Nation, has been reporting from the island since the 1980s, and her subtle insights and complicated love for the Haitian people, culture, religion and history bring the place to life. Her pointed criticisms of international aid unsettle our notions of what it means to help the less fortunate, but they are sharp and essential. -- TOM BEER

2. IN THE HOUSE UPON THE DIRT BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE WOODS, by Matt Bell (Soho Press, $25)

In Matt Bell's beguiling novel, a man battles bears and squids in the wilderness as he strives to reconcile with his family. The storytelling is strange and mythical, almost hallucinogenic. But the rhythm of Bell's prose (hinted at in the title) is enchanting, and once you recognize its beat, the adventure story is both entertaining and affecting. -- MARK ATHITAKIS

3. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL: An Autobiography of My Appetites, by Kate Christensen (Doubleday, $26.95)

PEN/Faulkner-winning novelist Christensen explains that memoir intruded on her fiction ""the way a cat might sit on a book you are trying to read."" Food adventures and quirky recipes (Dark Night of the Soul Soup, Bean Burrito) accompany a rare, juicy, sometimes searing, study of the formation of a writer's soul and a woman's heart. -- MARION WINIK

4. THE HIVE, by Gill Hornby (Little, Brown and Company, $26)

Writing comic novels about the foibles of wealthy parents -- or, more accurately, wealthy mothers -- never seems to get old. Taking its place on a shelf that includes ""Where'd You Go, Bernadette"" and ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" is Gill Hornby's ""The Hive,"" a sprightly send-up of the Queen Bees and Wannabes buzzing around school drop-off in a small English town. -- LAURIE MUCHNICK

5. THE DESERTERS: A Hidden History of World War II, by Charles Glass (Penguin Press, $27.95)

Amid the general flood of World II books, which continues unabated, Charles Glass' ""The Deserters"" stands out for its frank and clear-eyed examination of an underexplored phenomena of the Greatest Generation: soldiers who went AWOL and fled the front lines. Glass tells the story of three men -- one English, two American -- who deserted in Europe, and goes beyond opposition of cowardice versus bravery. These were battled-hardened men who had had enough. Glass tells you why in this stripped down, unromantic portrait of war. -- MATTHEW PRICE

6. STAY UP WITH ME, by Tom Barbash (Ecco, $22.99)

In these 13 stories, Barbash proves himself a crafter of gorgeous sentences and a wise, witty observer. He specializes in suffering -- especially the romantic kind -- and is brilliant at capturing awkwardness among family members. In ""The Break,"" a woman can't cope with her college-aged son's love life: ""The mother watched the hostess watching her son as he crossed the room, as though he were a chef's special she was hoping to try."" These tales, populated by lonely, well-meaning people, are compassionate but wickedly funny -- no easy feat to pull off. -- CARMELA CIURARU

7. A LIFE WORTH LIVING: Albert Camus and the Quest for Meaning"" by Robert Zaretsky (Harvard/Belknap, $22.95)

Albert Camus, the philosopher, moralist, journalist and author, would have been 100 in November. The centenary has spurred books, papers and reconsideration of his contributions to literature and his times. Robert Zaretsky's is one of the best. The Algerian-French Nobel Prize winner, known for novels such as ""The Stranger"" and ""The Plague"" and essays including ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" and ""Reflections on the Guillotine,"" wrote piercingly and urgently about facing injustice, the need for revolt, confronting absurdity and the search for meaning. Zaretsky underscores why the ideas of Camus, who died in a car accident in 1960, remain important today. -- PETER M. GIANOTTI",27/12/2013
NewsDay,Two New Radio Programs Launch in Nigeria to Entertain and Educate,"Population Media Center launches two new radio programs in Nigeria. Although the programs are supremely entertaining, their ultimate goal is to educate about important health and family planning issues to improve the health of women and children.

In Nigeria, most people turn to the radio for entertainment. This November, Population Media Center launched two new radio dramas in Nigeria that will air once per week for the next nine months. However, these soap operas bring something in addition to intriguing characters and lots of drama – these soap operas also educate.

“Two radio serial dramas, “Tafigawalo” (Working Towards Change) and “Hannunika Mai Sanda” (Power in Your Hands), are now at the broadcast stage,” says Ephraim Okon, Population Media Center’s country representative in Nigeria. “It has been challenging, but worth while as we hope to improve people’s health and well-being.”

Population Media Center is based in Shelburne, Vermont, but has worked in over 50 countries in its 15 year history. In every country, Population Media Center’s dramas are written, performed, and produced by locals.

“Characters and messages can only be meaningful if they’re defined by the culture,” says Kriss Barker, Population Media Center’s Vice President for International Programs. “That’s why we train and hire staff for each program. Each story has to be uniquely crafted to be effective.”

The new programs in Nigeria will be addressing a number of issues. “Tafigawalo,” which is in Pidgin, addresses family planning, safe motherhood, adolescent reproductive health, girls’ secondary education, and HIV/AIDS. “Hannunika Mai Sanda,” which is in Hausa, addresses early marriage, a health condition caused by early childbearing called obstetric fistula, family planning, reproductive health, and girls’ education. The programs will be broadcast in different regions of the country, aligning with the language and information needs identified by Population Media Center’s formative research.

“We impart information to people by creating believable characters dealing with regular issues,” says Barker. “When Dela pulls her 12-year-old daughter Aisha out of school to be married to a much older man for a dowry, our listeners will follow Aisha as she becomes pregnant before her young body is ready. We don’t need to preach messages because the consequences of different behaviors are clearly demonstrated. People are smart – they make connections for themselves.”

NewsDay,ANY LAB TEST NOW(r) Helps to Set a Health Baseline for the New Year,"Lab Testing Company Explains That Monitoring Resolutions Can Assist in Meeting Goals

The New Year inevitably brings an avalanche of resolutions, many of which involve living a healthier and more active life. ANY LAB TEST NOW® encourages all Americans to set a health baseline for the new year, utilizing lab tests to determine the state of their health and use that information to make their resolutions.

“Everyone wants to be healthier and fitter, and changes to diet and exercise are a great first step to that goal,” said Terri McCulloch, vice president of sales and marketing of ANY LAB TEST NOW. “But you can’t effectively make those resolutions and changes without knowing the state of your current health. Getting yourself tested so you have an accurate picture of your current health is an important first step to making a New Year’s resolution that sticks.”

ANY LAB TEST NOW encourages customers to begin setting their health baseline with tests like the Cholesterol Lipid Panel, Basic Check-Up Panel and Heart Health Panel. People can also download the Health & Wellness eBook for more comprehensive information. Once an initial baseline is determined, it is equally important to maintain routine testing so progress can be monitored as resolutions are put into practice.

NewsDay,Taking Drug to Prevent HIV Doesn't Seem to Encourage Risk-Taking,"Should people in danger of contracting HIV because they have risky sex take a pill to prevent infection, or will the medication encourage them to take even more sexual risks?

After years of debate on this question, a new international study suggests the medication doesn't lead people to stop using condoms or have more sex with more people.

The research isn't definitive, and it hasn't changed the mind of every expert. But one of the study's co-authors said the findings support the drug's use as a way to prevent infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

""People may have more partners or stop using condoms, but as well as we can tell, it's not because of [taking the drug to prevent HIV infection],"" said study co-author Dr. Robert Grant, a senior investigator with the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology in San Francisco.

The medication in question is called Truvada, which combines the drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir. It's normally used to treat people who are infected with HIV, but research -- in gay and bisexual men and in straight couples with one infected partner -- have shown that it can lower the risk of infection in people who become exposed to the virus through sex. However, it does not eliminate the risk of infection.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for prevention purposes in 2012.

Few people seem to be taking it for prevention purposes, however. Its manufacturer, Gilead, has disclosed that about 1,700 people are taking the drug for that reason in the United States, Grant said.

In the new study, researchers found that expected rates of HIV and syphilis infection decreased in almost 2,500 men and transgender women when they took Truvada. The study participants, who all faced high risk of HIV infection, were recruited in Peru, Ecuador, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand and the United States.

Some of the participants took Truvada while others took an inactive placebo. Those who believed they were taking Truvada ""were just as safe as everyone else,"" Grant said, suggesting that they weren't more likely to stop using condoms or be more promiscuous because they believed they had extra protection against HIV infection.

Grant said the design of the study allows scientists to better understand the choices that participants make.

The study is limited, however, because the researchers recruited participants instead of waiting for people to come to them. For that reason, it's impossible to know if people will seek out Truvada to take new levels of risk by, say, no longer using condoms.

There are many skeptics, including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, who fears that the drug will simply encourage people to make riskier decisions in regard to sex. One of these skeptics is Arleen Leibowitz, a professor emeritus of public policy at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles.

She said the study shows that many people failed to take Truvada as prescribed and often didn't take enough to be protected from HIV. That raises the prospect that some people would take risks because they believe they're protected when they actually aren't, she noted.

Leibowitz also said some of the statistics in the study are questionable because they don't include enough participants. And she said the participants may have lied about their sex lives to please the people who interviewed them.

""We'll learn a lot when its use becomes more general,"" Leibowitz said. ""But it's unfortunate to do experiments on the general population.""

For the moment, she said, the drug may be appropriate for some patients who need protection from HIV, but doctors should be cautious and make sure their patients take the medication.

The study is published in the Dec. 18 online edition of the journal PLoS One.

In other HIV/AIDS news, a new study -- also published in PLoS One -- reports that 20-year-old men infected with HIV in the United States and Canada can expect to live almost as long as the general population and make it, typically, to their early 70s.

NewsDay,Feds: Pharmacy owner charged in prescription drug fraud scheme,"A Port Washington man who runs two New York City pharmacies sold secondhand prescription drugs as ""factory fresh"" from legitimate suppliers in a scam to defraud government health programs out of millions of dollars, federal authorities said Friday.

Purna Chandra Aramalla, 65, has been held on a $2 million bond since his arraignment Tuesday on one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud and one count of money laundering, said the U.S. attorney in Manhattan and the FBI. He faces up to 20 years on each count.

Aramalla would order certain expensive, brand-name drugs, such as HIV medicines, from a street supplier who'd get them from patients who didn't want to take their medicine, federal officials said.

He, his supplier or another pharmacist working for him would use lighter fluid to dissolve the original labels, authorities said, and the drugs would be repackaged to look new, as if they came from legitimate suppliers, officials said.

Having bought the drugs cheap, he'd sell them for a profit at the pharmacy he owned, A Fair Deal Pharmacy in Corona, Queens, and at Quality Health Drug in the Bronx, which he ran for a relative, investigators said.

At the same time, Aramalla would also get reimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare on some of the prescriptions filled, authorities said. From October 2010 to August 2012, for example, he ordered about $1.7 million of certain brand-name HIV drugs from legitimate wholesalers but got about $4.3 million in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements -- an indication he had illegally charged the government programs for secondhand drugs, officials said.

""The illegal diversion of prescription medications threatens the health of those induced to sell their medication rather than take it,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. ""It threatens the health of those who unwittingly purchase the repackaged drugs believing them to be factory fresh.""

Aramalla's attorney, Catherine Foti in Manhattan, said she has not seen the evidence in the case, including alleged phone conversations taped by the FBI.

""Mr. Aramalla denies the charges and intends to defend his case vigorously,"" Foti said.

Authorities said they suspect Aramalla might have been selling secondhand prescription drugs and defrauding the government health care programs for the poor as early as 2009.

With the permission of Aramalla's top street supplier, FBI investigators taped the supplier's phone conversations with Aramalla, who could be heard in one call say that he'd take ""whatever"" the supplier could get, according to the FBI complaint.

The pharmacy owner would also buy MetroCards in bulk -- $2 million between 2010 and March 2013 -- and sell them to generate cash, which he used to buy unfilled prescriptions from customers, authorities said. He'd bill Medicaid or Medicare for reimbursements on those prescriptions, then share the proceeds with the customers, dubbing the payments ""loans,"" one of his pharmacists told agents, according to court papers.

Diverted drugs are dangerous, the court complaint said, because they may have been stored under bad conditions or may have expired.

Anyone who believes they may have bought secondhand prescription drugs may call the FBI hotline at 212-384-3555.",13/12/2013

NewsDay,UNITAID welcomes Bristol Myers Squibb's agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool,"UNITAID welcomes the announcement that yet another major pharmaceutical company has joined the Medicines Patent Pool, this time Bristol Myers Squibb, which finalized an agreement today that will make the vital HIV medicine Atazanavir more widely available in developing countries.

UNITAID welcomes the announcement that yet another major pharmaceutical company has joined the Medicines Patent Pool, this time Bristol Myers Squibb, which finalized an agreement today that will make the vital HIV medicine Atazanavir more widely available in developing countries.

“As the founder and the sole funder of the Medicines Patent Pool, UNITAID is delighted another licensing agreement has been obtained,” said Dr Philippe Douste-Blazy, Chairman of the UNITAID Executive Board. “This agreement will open the market for generic manufacturers to produce affordable versions of atazanavir in 110 developing countries.”

People on HIV treatment eventually need more potent drug combinations known as second-line treatment when they develop side effects or become infected with a drug resistant virus. Atazanavir is a key component of second-line medicines preferred by the World Health Organization (WHO).

“This agreement is particularly timely as some of the almost 10 million people who are now on HIV treatment in low- and middle-income countries will need to make the switch soon to second-line medicines,” said Dr Denis Broun, UNITAID Executive Director. “Moreover, UNITAID’s roll-out of better monitoring technology means more people will be diagnosed as needing second-line treatment. More affordable, generic versions of these medicines are essential to meet this rising demand and enable improved treatment.”

This agreement builds on UNITAID’s intervention to bring down the price of second-line medicines. In 2011 UNITAID helped launch the first generic version of Atazanavir, in a one-pill-a-day version combined with the Antiretroviral ritonavir. These pills do not require refrigeration, making them ideal for use in low-income countries.

“Now we look forward to more companies joining the Medicines Patent Pool with other vital HIV products,” concluded Dr Douste-Blazy.

NewsDay,Globalsurance Releases New Article on HIV Amongst Adolescents,"Globalsurance has released a new article on its blog titled ""HIV in Adolescents on the Rise"".

Globalsurance has released a new article on its blog about the rising prevalence of HIV amongst adolescents. The article examines the reasons why the virus is on the rise, and it cites studies from groups such as the World Health Organization.

The article begins by recapping World AIDS Day, which took place on December 1st. At the event, it was reported that over 2 million children between the ages of 10 and 19 have the disease, and although the general population has seen a 30 percent decrease in AIDS deaths over the past seven years, amongst adolescents and teens, AIDS deaths have increased by 50 percent.

The Globalsurance article then explains that AIDS is becoming more fatal to adolescents even as it becomes more manageable in adults because adolescents are less likely to get tested for HIV. Adolescents who are unknowingly HIV positive are more likely to engage in unsafe sex or drug use with others their own age, further spreading the virus within the adolescent demographic.

The article then explains how children and teens may require HIV counseling and treatment services specifically tailored to the needs of young people. Health care professionals offering counseling and treatment must also be trained in acting in a non-judgmental and positive manner toward their young patients, or else teens may be afraid to seek further medical services.

Lastly, the article offers some suggestions for increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS beyond World AIDS Day. The article proposes that more educational campaigns should be created to generate interest among children and teenagers, more celebrity role models should advocate HIV testing, and social media channels can be better utilized. Awareness campaigns can also be used within HIV clinics, and flexible hours, lower prices and even separate waiting areas for teens might encourage more young adults to see a medical professional and discuss HIV and AIDS.

NewsDay,DKT Ethiopia Contributes to Family Planning Success Story Highlighted in Population Council's Studies in Family Planning,"The Population Council’s Studies in Family Planning (December 2013) credits the contraceptive social marketing and behavior change communication implemented by DKT Ethiopia as contributing factors to ""an emerging family planning success story.""

A new article published in the Population Council’s Studies in Family Planning (December 2013) calls Ethiopia, which was the site of the 2013 International Conference on Family Planning, ""an emerging family planning success story,"" and credits the contraceptive social marketing and behavior change communication implemented by DKT Ethiopia as contributing factors to that success.

Authors David J. Olson and Andrew Piller posit that four elements were mainly responsible for the success – political will by the government, generous donor support, the government’s network of health extension workers, and NGOs and public-private partnerships – and offer some lessons learned that could be applied to other African countries in emulating the Ethiopian success.

One NGO and its contributions made in Ethiopia noted by the authors was DKT International and its DKT Ethiopia operation. ""DKT regularly supplies 32 percent of Ethiopia’s couple years of protection (CYPs) and more than quadrupled its annual CYPs from nearly 600,000 in 2000 to more than 2.5 million in 2012,"" the authors noted.

DKT Ethiopia has been a major contributor to effective family planning in that country since it began operations in 1990 with the introduction of Hiwot Trust condoms. DKT’s program now supplies over a third of the country’s condom sales as well as oral and injectable contraceptives and other reproductive health products, and operates the second largest contraceptive social marketing project in Africa, based on analysis of services and products delivered. In 2012, DKT Ethiopia’s efforts averted 1.1 million pregnancies, 780,000 births, 3,300 maternal deaths, 28,300 child deaths and 101,400 abortions.

""Our social marketing of contraceptives and family planning services has proved highly cost-effective in Ethiopia as it improves lives and living conditions in that country,"" said Christopher H. Purdy, Executive Vice President of DKT International and a former country director of DKT Ethiopia. ""By leveraging the power of the private sector, we market and sell attractive, affordable contraceptive products and services through normal commercial channels while educating consumers on the choices that best suit their needs. Paying even a modest sum for a product or a service turns a ‘beneficiary’ into a ‘customer,’ who is more likely to actually use what they paid for, enabling the program to be self-sustaining.""

With regard to family planning activities, DKT Ethiopia maintains offices and warehouses across the country as supported by a database of nearly 20,000 sales points providing real-time data, and provides several brands across product type in order to reach all economic segments with messages linking family planning and reproductive health to a better life. DKT Ethiopia also uses condom distribution in successful programs to fight sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

This market research report evaluates the global vaccine market by technology class, types, end users, disease indication, and geography. Furthermore, the technology class is divided into eight segments, namely, live/attenuated, toxoid, conjugate, sub-unit, recombinant vector, DNA, synthetic, and dentritic vaccines. Of the above mentioned segments, sub-unit vaccine is the largest revenue segment; however, synthetic vaccines, recombinant vector vaccines, and DNA vaccines will be the fastest-growing segments.

The global vaccine market was valued at $27 billion in the year 2012. At the end of 2013, the market is expected to be $32.05 billion and is poised to reach approximately $84 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 11.36% from 2013 to 2022.

Therapeutic vaccines, specifically targeting cancers and allergies, will offer vast opportunities for new players entering this market. The launch of the first FDA-approved therapeutic vaccine, Provenge by Dendreon (U.S.), for treating prostate cancer has acknowledged the potential of vaccines in therapeutics. This scenario is expected to further revolutionize the industry towards massive growth in the next 5 to 10 years.

The global market for vaccines is expected to grow, backed by technological advancements with respect to the development of novel vaccines towards emerging infectious diseases, cancers, and allergies.

NewsDay,Remarks of President Barack Obama – Remembering Nelson Mandela,"To Graça Machel and the Mandela family; to President Zuma and members of the government; to heads of state and government, past and present; distinguished guests - it is a singular honor to be with you today, to celebrate a life unlike any other. To the people of South Africa - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us. His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.

It is hard to eulogize any man - to capture in words not just the facts and the dates that make a life, but the essential truth of a person - their private joys and sorrows; the quiet moments and unique qualities that illuminate someone’s soul. How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, and in the process moved billions around the world.

Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by elders of his Thembu tribe - Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement - a movement that at its start held little prospect of success. Like King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed, and the moral necessity of racial justice. He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War. Emerging from prison, without force of arms, he would - like Lincoln - hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. Like America’s founding fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations - a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power.

Given the sweep of his life, and the adoration that he so rightly earned, it is tempting then to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, he insisted on sharing with us his doubts and fears; his miscalculations along with his victories. “I’m not a saint,” he said, “unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.”

It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection - because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens he carried - that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood - a son and husband, a father and a friend. That is why we learned so much from him; that is why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness; persistence and faith. He tells us what’s possible not just in the pages of dusty history books, but in our own lives as well.

Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Madiba was right that he inherited, “a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness” from his father. Certainly he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of, “a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments…a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people.”

But like other early giants of the ANC - the Sisulus and Tambos - Madiba disciplined his anger; and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand-up for their dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price. “I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination,” he said at his 1964 trial. “I’ve cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”

Mandela taught us the power of action, but also ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those you agree with, but those who you don’t. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and passion, but also his training as an advocate. He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depended upon his.

Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough; no matter how right, they must be chiseled into laws and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of conditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that, “prisoners cannot enter into contracts.” But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement, but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy; true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African.

Finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa- Ubuntu - that describes his greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. We can never know how much of this was innate in him, or how much of was shaped and burnished in a dark, solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small - introducing his jailors as honored guests at his inauguration; taking the pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS - that revealed the depth of his empathy and understanding. He not only embodied Ubuntu; he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailor as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion, generosity and truth. He changed laws, but also hearts.

For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe - Madiba’s passing is rightly a time of mourning, and a time to celebrate his heroic life. But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. With honesty, regardless of our station or circumstance, we must ask: how well have I applied his lessons in my own life?

It is a question I ask myself - as a man and as a President. We know that like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took the sacrifice of countless people - known and unknown - to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are the beneficiaries of that struggle. But in America and South Africa, and countries around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not done. The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality and universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important. For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger, and disease; run-down schools, and few prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs; and are still persecuted for what they look like, or how they worship, or who they love.

We, too, must act on behalf of justice. We, too, must act on behalf of peace. There are too many of us who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us who stand on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.

The questions we face today - how to promote equality and justice; to uphold freedom and human rights; to end conflict and sectarian war - do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child in Qunu. Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows us that is true. South Africa shows us we can change. We can choose to live in a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity.

We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa, and young people around the world - you can make his life’s work your own. Over thirty years ago, while still a student, I learned of Mandela and the struggles in this land. It stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities - to others, and to myself - and set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be better. He speaks to what is best inside us. After this great liberator is laid to rest; when we have returned to our cities and villages, and rejoined our daily routines, let us search then for his strength - for his largeness of spirit - somewhere inside ourselves. And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, or our best laid plans seem beyond our reach - think of Madiba, and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of a cell:

It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the master of my fate:

I am the captain of my soul.

What a great soul it was. We will miss him deeply. May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela. May God bless the people of South Africa.",10/12/2013

NewsDay,Patel: An end to AIDS is within our reach,"Advances in medicine since the discovery of AIDS in 1981 have given us the technology to contain, if not eradicate, this deadly disease. Yet HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, continues to spread. There are 34 million people living with HIV or AIDS worldwide, 1.1 million of them in the United States. Every 9.5 minutes, someone is infected with HIV in the United States. Every year, approximately 50,000 new infections occur.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this number has been stable since the mid 1990s. That’s one way of looking at it. But why hasn’t the number decreased? The statistics could lead one to say that government is not doing enough, or that the policies in place aren’t working. It could also be that the people who are affected or at risk are ignoring HIV-prevention messages or failing to adopt healthy behaviors to fight against this epidemic, which, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has claimed almost 636,000 lives in the United States alone.

CDC data show that injection drug users represented 8 percent of new HIV infections nationwide in 2010 and 16 percent of those living with HIV in 2009. According to the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance study, New York City has the largest population of injection drug users in the country, with estimates of 40,000 to 120,000. To date, 85,000 cases of HIV have been related to injection drug use in New York City.

According to the New York State Department of Health, in 1992, more than half of new HIV infections — 52 percent — were due to injection drug use. That year, the state implemented the Syringe Exchange Program to reduce HIV infection through contaminated syringes. The program, which provides injection drugs users with clean syringes and needles, permits community-based groups, not-for-profit organizations and government entities to posses and provide hypodermic needles and syringes without a prescription with the purpose of reducing HIV transmission.

Since its implementation, statewide rates of HIV infection by use of contaminated needles have dropped: to just over 5 percent in 2009. The state health department expanded the program in 2000 to prevent other blood-borne disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C. There are 21 program sites: 14 are in New York City, and there’s one each in Nassau County (Hempstead) and Suffolk (Wyandanch). Statewide, the program has enrolled 150,000 injection drug users.

Yet syringe exchange programs have been a matter of heated debate in the United States, more so because of our country’s “zero tolerance” attitude toward drug use. Federal policy prohibits the use of federal funds for syringe exchange programs, though state and city health departments are free to use their own money to operate such programs. Additional funding is required to reach more people, but the federal policy starves the program of the resources it needs.

Despite the encouraging results of New York’s syringe exchange program, it is difficult to replicate in much of the United States. Where similar programs are allowed, laws forbidding the possession of drug paraphernalia make their implementation difficult. This disconnect between public health and the legal system needs to be changed.

Our country might be far from ending illegal drug use, but the end of the AIDS epidemic should be in our sights. We can get even closer by decriminalizing syringes and expanding access to funding for these community-based life-saving programs.

NewsDay,"Roberts: Nelson Mandela was a great man, but not a saint","DELHI, India - Be in no doubt that Nelson Mandela, the world's most famous political prisoner, campaigner against racist rule and magnanimous leader, was a great man.

When spending time with him, one felt awed, weak at the knees. Madiba, the tribal name by which he was fondly known by many, had charm and warmth. He was also responsible, more than any other individual, for the remarkably peaceful transition in South Africa.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Madiba's close friend and fellow leader of the anti-apartheid campaign, once told me how he felt an immense ""generosity of spirit"" from Mandela. The archbishop naturally saw Christian elements in Madiba's readiness to forgive his white racist abusers, and his compassion for the weak. ""You can even think of Jesus - it's quite in order to say that there are Christ-like aspects of him.""

But you shouldn't remember him as a saint. Bishop Tutu didn't think of him this way - guffawing at the idea that Mandela was anything so dry, hollow and uninteresting. He may be compared to the likes of Mahatma Gandhi or Mother Teresa, as a great moral figure of our times. But the myth should not overpower the reality of a humane, richly complicated, and passionate individual.

In comparison with other politicians, in Africa and beyond, he stands out for his self-restraint.

As free South Africa's first president, he volunteered for only a single term in office. Look just next door, to Zimbabwe, for a striking contrast: Its near-despotic leader, Robert Mugabe, is now in his fourth, disastrous, decade as ruler.

Yet Madiba is far more interesting than either the villain next door or the simple saintly figure. His achievements are the greater because he himself admitted to errors, at times bungling policy. Those failings matter. He was more likely to learn from mistakes than the haughty sort of leader who refuses to accept he made any. Others should pay as much attention to his slip-ups as to his achievements.

Take the great post-apartheid misery that South Africa suffered in the first two decades of democracy: the AIDS epidemic. Mandela failed as president to tackle the spread of HIV, even as terrifyingly large numbers of South Africans became infected.

As early as 1991 he had grasped (judging from one of his private notebooks from that year) that the disease threatened a ""crisis for the country."" Yet in office he did almost nothing to stop its spread.

He recalled later at an event I attended in Cape Town that after spending so many years in prison, he was shy when it came to talking about a sexually transmitted virus. South Africa, too, faced a host of other challenges on his watch - political violence, economic upheaval, ongoing racial tension. But his inaction on AIDS then gave way to the outright denial of the epidemic, and harassment of those who tried to tackle the spread of HIV, by his successor as president, Thabo Mbeki. The result was a pandemic that claimed millions of South African lives, many unnecessarily, as drugs to treat victims were long withheld.

To his immense credit, however, Mandela conceded his early error. After leaving the presidency, he became a significant part of a campaign for a new AIDS policy. In retirement, he would speak up for effective education and treatment, especially when his own son succumbed to the disease in 2005. To Mbeki's fury, too, Madiba pushed within the ruling African National Congress for South Africa to tackle AIDS seriously. With the denialist Mbeki gone from office, thankfully the country has now come to grips with the pandemic.

Or take economic policy. After years in prison, Mandela emerged to lead South Africa still believing, in effect, in Soviet-style economics. It took advice from China's leaders (among others) to change his mind. But he was willing to switch, to get South Africa's Afrikaner state-run economy to open up and flourish.

For that, South Africa should be grateful. The past two decades of relative stability and steady economic growth went far better than many predicted would follow the end of apartheid rule. Yet many young, jobless, and angry South Africans are, understandably, still angry. Some attack Mandela as a stooge and a fool for abandoning nationalist, populist or far-left policies of old.

I recall attending a funeral for a much-loved African nationalist leader in Soweto in 2003, at which both Madiba and Mugabe were present. The crowd of mostly young African men roared in far louder appreciation for the Zimbabwean strongman than for Mandela or any other leader present.

The reason: Many were furious that whites still control a huge proportion of capital in South Africa. Even now some young South Africans accuse Mandela of being a sellout to privileged minority interests. The deal he struck at the end of apartheid, they feel, saw a shift in political power but too little economic change.

I recall one bitter letter to a newspaper a decade ago in which Madiba was called ""an albatross round our necks."" Poorer South Africans are the least likely to venerate him. For all the political change that came in 1994, South Africa's economy is still remarkably dominated by whites.

But Mandela made the best of a very difficult economic job, stabilizing South Africa's vulnerable post-apartheid economy, encouraging growth, and handing out welfare, even if rapid redistribution of assets between whites and blacks proved impossible to achieve quickly.

His great achievement in policy was, of course, to oversee a profoundly liberal constitution for South Africa that enshrines racial, sexual, gender and other rights. But also he could compromise, and admit the need to shift policy.

In his personal life, similarly, Mandela had his failings. Take his wife's word for that. At an event marking Mandela's 90th birthday, Graca Machel told me of her husband, ""He is definitely not a saint!"" With great warmth she related, too, how it ""definitely wasn't love at first sight"" when the two met in 1990. Their great fondness for each other grew only later.

Even in old age Madiba had an eager eye for beautiful women. One female Irish journalist recalls how he offered to marry her, at a press conference. A close friend of mine, an Indian-South African, thought that Mandela had, in effect, offered to marry her, too (rather more seriously), right before Machel came along. As a young man, a handsome boxer, lawyer of near-regal descent, he was widely described as a heartbreaker.

He could be petty, too. At a small lunch I attended with him in 2005, old friends teased him about his being persnickety and pedantic, after he had demanded a particular brand of sparkling water and rejected another. He insisted that his newspapers and hearing aid be arranged just so. To be fair, he took the gentle mocking in good humor.

His children were known to resent him at times as a distant father. He could be aloof, stiff and calculating. Machel told me that ""Papa"" (as she sometimes called her husband) could be stubborn, quick to anger and intolerant when his grandchildren performed badly at school.

And particularly difficult questions should one day be answered about what he knew of the activities of Winnie Mandela, his second wife and the great love of his life. She, though acquitted in 1991 in one murder case (but convicted of kidnapping), remains under a cloud because of other unexplained deaths in Soweto in the 1980s. There is much yet to be revealed about the disappearances and deaths of political figures in the anti-apartheid movement.

In all this - and in his achievements as a rich, humane but at times flawed figure - Mandela has much to offer other leaders. He liked to joke about his eventual death, chuckling that the first thing he would do in heaven - he had no doubt that he was headed there - would be to sign up for membership at the local branch of the African National Congress. It was his way of saying that he was a political and pragmatic man: not a saint.

Remember him as a warm, powerful and humane figure. Not an unearthly one.

NewsDay,"Jan-Pro of Columbus Announces the Exclusive ""Enviroshield"" Electrostatic Disinfecting System","With the flu season among us, Jan-Pro, a Columbus cleaning company announces an exclusive disinfectant called EnviroShield. EnviroShield provides users with a sprayer nozzle that adds an electrostatic negative charge to the disinfecting solution as it is applied, so that it actually surrounds and clings to the surface it touches.

Fighting infection is an issue everywhere right now. According to MRSA Survivors Network, more Americans die annually from invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections than from HIV/AIDS, H1N1 influenza and Parkinson’s disease. These deaths are caused by making physical contact with contaminated areas which includes light switches, door knobs and bathroom fixtures. Killing bacteria is essential in preventing the spread of these infections.

A Columbus commercial cleaning company, Jan-Pro, offers a system called the EnviroShield Spray Disinfecting System which can help fight these flu bacteria. The Owner of Jan-Pro Columbus, Rick Wolverton, told us, “EnviroShield is a high performance method of disinfecting surfaces that are normally difficult to reach.” EnviroShield provides users with a sprayer nozzle that adds an electrostatic negative charge to the disinfecting solution as it is applied, so that it actually surrounds and clings to the surface it touches. This means that, the system will safely disinfect anything that it comes in contact with. It can be used on office desks and furniture (no worries about damp papers, the Electrostatic System is dry to the touch), bathrooms, kitchens, anywhere that people come in contact with.Since “Enviroshield” is applied through an electrostatic applicator, the operator just points the tool at all surfaces that need to be disinfected and the disinfectant thoroughly coats all surfaces front, back and in between.

The disinfecting agent used in the “EnviroShield” system is a product called EnviroTru®, it is a multi-purpose disinfectant and deodorizing cleaner that meets all EPA requirements for Toxicity Category IV (no harmful dermal, ocular, inhalation or ingestion effects). Environmentally safe, EnviroTru requires no special handling, does not require protective clothing, gloves or special ventilation or biohazard disposal, is non-flammable, and poses no health risks or side effects.

The “Enviroshield Sprayer achieves 100% coverage. Rick also went on to tell us, “We have tried many processes to disinfect surfaces over the years and we have yet to find anything that compares to this type of commercial cleaning disinfectant.""

NewsDay,Florida-based Dr. Robert Dean Joins Relief Mission to Philippines,"Dr. Robert Dean visits The Philippines with The Starkey Hearing Foundation on a mission to help survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, and provide hearing aids to children in need.

It has been nearly a month since the devastating Typhoon Haiyan hit the islands in the Philippines, but the long-term recovery has just begun. Dr. Robert Dean of Tampa, Florida has partnered with the Starkey Hearing Foundation to join in the relief efforts. He left on November 28th to join the foundation on a previously planned mission to fit over 5,000 deaf children with hearing aids, but the trip now has an even broader relief objective.

The partnership between Dr. Dean and the Starkey Hearing Foundation formed through Dr. Dean’s passion for making people healthier across the globe. His over 20-year medical experience has led him to study cholera, treat post-travel illnesses, and conduct research on women with HIV in Mexico. Dr. Dean also runs a foundation focused on conserving the world’s natural eco-systems and improving the quality of life in rain forest regions by increasing sustainability through improved social and economic infrastructure.

“When I agreed to go on a volunteer trip for the Starkey Hearing Foundation several weeks ago, I had no idea how dramatically circumstances there were about to change,” said Dr. Dean. “I had already booked my trip when Haiyan struck and devastated the islands. Those who were lucky enough to survive are in dire need of basic aid such as food, water, and shelter – resources that are scarce if available at all. I feel privileged to play a small part in helping the local population together with Starkey.”

Dr. Dean intends to post updates during his travels from November 29th – December 12th. Please visit http://www.doctorrobertdean.com for his latest blog entries and to learn more about Dr. Dean. He is also encouraging others to support the efforts in the Philippines by donating here: http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/DrRobertDean/RobertDeansFundraisingPage.

More about the Starkey Hearing Foundation: The Foundation donates and fits more than 100,000 hearing aids annually. As a member of President Clinton’s Global Initiative, Starkey has pledged to fit one million hearing aids this decade. In addition to giving the gift of hearing through worldwide hearing missions, the Starkey Hearing Foundation also promotes hearing health awareness and education through the Listen Carefully initiative and provides hearing instruments to low-income Americans through the Hear Now program.

NewsDay,Association of Nurses in AIDS Care Announces Chief Nursing Officer,"ANAC appoints Carole Treston, RN, MPH as first Chief Nursing Officer.

The Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (ANAC) is pleased to announce the appointment of Carole Treston, RN, MPH as Chief Nursing Officer (CNO). Carole is a visionary nurse leader with significant clinical, senior management and health policy experience and expertise.

ANAC’s search for its first CNO included a competitive process that garnered multiple applications which were evaluated by an objective review panel. Carole’s high level of experience and competence in clinical, education, research and political issues affecting the field of HIV nursing emerged as an ideal fit for this important position.

Since January of this year, Carole has worked with ANAC as a Public Policy Consultant, representing ANAC and the unique perspective of nurses in HIV care in national coalitions and through frequent interactions with members of the Administration and Congress. Previously, Carole was the Executive Director of AIDS Alliance for Children Youth and Families, a national organization headquartered in Washington, DC providing policy, advocacy, training and capacity building assistance programs for Ryan White Part D providers and consumers.

Carole developed one of the first comprehensive, family-centered HIV/AIDS programs in the country, a demonstration project in Philadelphia in 1988 that led to the development of the Ryan White Title IV/Part D programs. During the 10 years that she directed that program, she also served as a Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) Study Nurse and Study Coordinator, managing a multi-site pediatric and maternal clinical trials unit in Philadelphia. She received her MPH from Columbia University, with an emphasis on health policy and management. Carole served as Executive Director of the Children’s Hope Foundation – an organization that partnered with 120 agencies to improve the quality of life for families with HIV/AIDS in the New York City area. From 2002-2006, she was the Director of Operations for the PACTG/IMPAACT Group, the multi-site, international clinical trials network, sponsored by NIAID at the NIH. During her tenure, significant expansion of international research sites occurred.

With Carole as CNO, ANAC looks forward to advancing ANAC’s mission and working collaboratively with the HIV, Nursing and health care communities towards a shared goal of an AIDS free generation.

Carole can be contacted directly at carole@anacnet.org.

NewsDay,"STRENGTH: A One-night Only Art Happening Featuring Paintings, Sculpture, and an Interactive Performance Piece at the HIGHLINE LOFT","NYC artist MITCHEL COFFMAN’S exhibit, STRENGTH, opens at the HIGHLINE LOFT Thursday January 16th, 2014 from 6-9PM for one-night only. The HIGHLINE LOFT is located at 508 W. 26TH ST., 5th floor, NEW YORK, NY.

Strength pays homage to Coffman’s painting mentor, COLOMBIAN ARTIST/MURALIST JORGE ALVAREZ who lost his battle with HIV in 2007. The two met while Coffman was competing in men’s lacrosse at the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2004. It was a recommendation from Coffman’s coach to take a course offered by Alvarez that brought them together. Working under Alvarez in his studio for the next three years, Coffman learned the classical academic approach to painting. This also gave him the opportunity to paint a mural under the direction of Alvarez for the Brooklyn Diner, located in Times Square.

In order to deal with the passing of his mentor in 2007, Coffman began to incorporate components of his athletic training into his artwork. His first breakthrough came in the form of a 400 lb. tractor tire that he covered in paint and flipped across a large piece of canvas. The piece began as a form of catharsis, but was eventually the spring board for what Coffman’s work would ultimately become.

STRENGTH will feature paintings, sculpture, and a large scale interactive performance piece.

The performance piece is Coffman’s tribute to his mentor. It combines elements of art, athletics, and live Latin jazz music resulting in a large scale painting to be created that evening. The music will be provided by the Gabriel Guerrero Quartet, presented by the New York Jazz Academy.

THE EVENT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. TO SEE MORE GO TO WWW.MITCHELCOFFMAN.COM

NewsDay,Papachristos: We can end gun violence by treating it as an epidemic,"Is it possible to predict who is most likely to die at the hands of a gun? Not shootings like those at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., or the Washington Navy Yard, but the all-too-common shootings that occur in neighborhoods across the country.

The idea is not far-fetched if one drills down into the nature of gun violence, which, in the way it is transmitted, bears striking similarities to public health epidemics such as cholera in Haiti or HIV/AIDS in the United States.

Epidemics of any kind are not random. HIV is a blood-borne pathogen transmitted primarily through sex or intravenous drug use. Once its patterns of transmission and the communities most affected were identified in the United States, extensive public health campaigns helped transform AIDS from an always-fatal disease into one that is chronic and manageable for many of those infected.

Along the same lines, a cholera epidemic exploded in Haiti in 2010 when sewage from a base housing United Nations peacekeepers leaked into a nearby river that supplied drinking water. The transmission, far from random, ultimately killed more than 8,000 Haitians.

So it is with gun violence. There are patterns of transmission in the United States that go beyond aggregate factors such as race, age, gender and income. On an individual level, social networks - the people one hangs out with - can predict a given person's likelihood of being shot and killed.

In a study published last month in the American Journal of Public Health, my colleague Christopher Wildeman and I applied the science of social networks to patterns of gun homicide in Chicago. The idea is straightforward: Treat gun homicide like a blood-borne pathogen, something transmitted from person to person through specific risky behaviors. Put another way, gun violence is not an airborne pathogen: You don't catch a bullet like you catch a cold.

More than 40 percent of all gun homicides in the study occurred within a network of 3,100 people, roughly 4 percent of the community's population. Simply being among the 4 percent increased a person's odds of being killed by a gun by 900 percent.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

These numbers tell us that gun violence spreads like HIV infection: You're more likely to ""catch"" the disease if you engage in risky behaviors with someone who might be infected. And it's not just people's friends who affect their likelihood of getting shot, but also their friends' friends. This is similar to the transmission of HIV: Your current partner's past sexual partners affect your exposure, even if you don't know them.

In the case of gun homicide, seemingly random victims end up ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" by indirect exposure, such as getting a ride from a friend's cousin or by going to the party of a friend's friend. In these cases, victimization is tragic but not random.

Understanding the networked nature of gun violence has important implications for how it can be addressed. Prevention efforts can be directed toward those individuals and communities most susceptible to the infection. The solution is not broad, sweeping policies, such as New York's ""stop and frisk"" or mass arrests, but the opposite: highly targeted efforts to reach specific people in specific places, akin to providing clean needles to drug users to prevent the spread of HIV.

By studying gun violence like we study disease, we, as a society, can improve our chances of discovering who has a greater chance of being shot and focus resources to police better, smarter and more fairly.

NewsDay,Global Fund Commitments Show the World's Dedication to an AIDS-free Future,"Statement of Charles Lyons, President and CEO of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation

“The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) commends the many nations, private organizations, and individuals who committed to supporting the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) during Tuesday’s replenishment conference in Washington, D.C.

“We are at a historic moment in the fight against HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. The $12 billion pledged by partners will allow for much-needed scale-up of proven and effective lifesaving programs, ensuring that we fully capitalize on the results achieved to date and make even more dramatic gains over the next three years. These pledges are also a promise to the millions of people living with HIV, TB, and malaria that the world remains united in its commitment to defeat these devastating diseases.

“The Global Fund has been a leader in pushing to scale up programs that prevent and treat HIV infection. In many of the countries where EGPAF works, the Global Fund supports the purchase of antiretroviral medications used in EGPAF-supported clinics to prevent and treat pediatric and adult HIV infections— to keep keeping women, children, and families affected by HIV healthy and alive.

“While the replenishment meeting resulted in an unprecedented level of funding commitments—almost $3 billion more than the $9.2 billion pledged at the last replenishment meeting in 2010 — and as President Obama stated in his remarks on Monday, efforts must continue in order to reach the $15 billion pledging goal and to ensure that funding committed to the Global Fund by the United States does not end up left on the table.

“EGPAF once again thanks those who stepped up to the plate to support the Global Fund. We look forward to working with the Global Fund and other partners to fight HIV, TB, and malaria and to end pediatric AIDS.”

NewsDay,"Non-Profit Foundation, Test It Develops Home STD Test Kit, Tests for 6 Major STDs, Plans to Distribute to Third World Nations","Test It Foundation, a Washington Non-profit Organization, plans to develop an easy, affordable and discreet at-home STD Test Kit with a Humanitarian Twist

Test It Foundation is now developing technology from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to create an easy-to-use STD testing kit, capable of diagnosing six major sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It can screen for HIV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Herpes Simplex, Bacterial Vaginosis and Trichomoniasis, all from one kit.

Test It Foundation's home STD testing kit will work in the same way as an over-the-counter pregnancy test, using a urine sample that shows a clear reaction if STDs are present. The STD test kit is projected to cost under $50. Once developed, the kit should be available in major drugstores, where it can be easily and discreetly purchased.

During the Indiegogo Crowdfunding campaign, for $55.00, Test It Foundation will send one test to a developing or third world country for every test that is purchased in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, England and Australia. Test It Foundation is working towards partnering with other nonprofit medical relief organizations that are presently working in third world and developing countries and plans on using them for logistics and distribution of the test.

“Our goals in developing this product are not to just market it to the US in the Over-The-Counter markets, but to distribute this technology to third-world and developing countries where healthcare is not readily available,” says Director, Jarrett LeClaire.

Test It Foundation decided to use crowdfunding in their efforts to raise capital, and Indiegogo in particular because they have supported efforts in both the science and health field as well as for philanthropic endeavors. A crowfunding campaign was the best option for Test It Foundation, because it will enable them to develop the product and distribute it either free of charge or at a reduced cost to the area’s of the world that are underserved medically. Test It Foundation is planning on starting their crowdfunding campaign on Tuesday December 3rd. The initial amount they are trying to raise will be $75,000. This money will be used to develop a prototype and start first round testing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US reported over 1.6 million STD cases in 2009. This number is likely only a fraction of the total as many infections go unreported and undiagnosed. Estimates suggest there are 1.9 million new cases every year, costing the US healthcare system $16.4 billion. A simple and affordable home testing kit will provide a convenient way to obtain instant results and will allow every sexually active adult to test themselves regularly.

“Many people avoid STD screening due to their embarrassment or the expense. As a result, the incidence of some infections has grown exponentially because people who are unaware of their infection inadvertently infect their sexual partners,” says Jarrett LeClaire, Director and Founder of Test It Foundation.

About Test It Foundation

Test It Foundation was developed by Jarrett LeClaire through the work of Malignext Targeting Technologies. Malignext is a company he formed after his wife Ilene was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy to remove the cancer. The mastectomy was not successful because a clear or negative margin was not obtained from around her tumor. Jarrett was informed that up to 35% of these small and/or nonpalpable tumors required a second and sometimes third surgery to completely remove the tumor. Jarrett partnered with a surgeon and set about developing a way to mark these tumors and make them palpable as well visible so that the re-excision rate would drop significantly. After doing research at Texas A&M university through the Bio-Medical engineering school and funding research at Washington State University, Malignext won a grant through the TAP (Technology Assistance Program) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory at Richland, Washington.

Jarrett was made aware that the national laboratory system had existing technologies and were looking for entrepreneurs to further develop them. Jarrett contacted the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory about an unrelated technology and was made aware of the STD testing technology that would become Test IT Foundation. After some research about the technology and how many people it positively affect, Jarrett decided to go all in and develop the technology so that it would be available in the US, but also make a

massive positive impact for people that are not able to readily get medical care or service.

British director Steve McQueen won the best director prize for ""12 Years a Slave,"" the historical drama about a free black man sold into slavery and based on the 1853 memoir of Solomon Northup.

Tuesday's awards pit director David O. Russell's ""American Hustle,"" which will be released in U.S. theaters later this month, and ""12 Year a Slave,"" the winner of the top prize at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, as early contenders in the race for the Academy Awards.

Redford picked up the best actor award for his solo performance in the survival drama ""All is Lost,"" and Blanchett was named best actress for her portrayal of a pill-popping former socialite forced to deal with reduced circumstances in Woody Allen's film ""Blue Jasmine.""

Actor Jared Leto won the best supporting actor prize for his role in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" as an HIV-positive transgender woman who helps smuggle medication not approved in the United States to AIDS patients.

NewsDay,New HIV Strain May Move to AIDS More Quickly: Study,"A recently discovered, aggressive strain of HIV leads to faster development of AIDS than other HIV strains, according to a new study.

More than 60 epidemic strains of HIV-1 exist. This new strain has the shortest period from infection to the development of AIDS, at about five years, according to researchers at Lund University, in Sweden.

The new strain is a fusion of the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau, a small country in West Africa. It has been identified only in that region. When two strains join, they form what's called a ""recombinant.""

""Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they developed,"" doctoral student Angelica Palm said in a Lund University news release.

Previous research has shown that the global spread of different recombinants is increasing. Moreover, increasingly mixed and complex HIV strains are becoming more common in countries and regions with high levels of immigration, such as the United States and Europe.

The new study was published online recently and will appear in the print version of the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Patrik Medstrand, a professor of clinical virology at Lund University, said HIV is a dynamic and variable virus.

""New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing,"" Medstrand said in the news release. ""We therefore need to be aware of how the HIV-1 epidemic changes over time.""

Health care services should be aware that certain HIV types can be more aggressive than others, the researchers said.

NewsDay,"The Bee2Bee Network Teaches Young Professionals a Lesson in ""Paying it Forward.""","The best gift that you can give a young professional today is a job – but not just any job, an opportunity for them to learn, grow and create their own futures. That is what the Bee2Bee Network is about.

A group of Young Professionals at the Bee2Bee Network are getting a lesson in paying it forward and the latest Google Virtual Reality software and at no cost to them or their families.

The Bee2Bee Network will be launching the first virtual 3D mall in the US using Google's Virtual Tour Technology. Soon you will be able to take a look inside local stores and malls without actually stepping foot onto the property. Local businesses can now affordably market their businesses online 24/7 thanks to the Bee2Bee Network's new application.

Yasmine Clarke, a 20-year software industry veteran, former software engineer and corporate trainer is the founder of the Bee2Bee Network, a non-profit which teaches young professionals how to code and the very latest in Agile/Lean software application development at no cost to them or their families. The Bee2Bee Network is also the first Digital Agency Internship Program in the country which is also operated by Young Professionals ages (12-24).

The Bee2Bee Network’s mission is to introduce Young Professionals to the many new skills and opportunities that are available in the technology industry while helping small businesses with their social media and technology needs at a reasonable cost. Ms. Clarke left her comfortable six-figure salary with an international consulting firm and used her own money to fund this initiative because she wants to make a difference in the future of American Young Professionals within the technology industry.

According to Ms. Clarke, “We are building talent that is made in America. There are so many highly skilled opportunities that are available but often go unfilled or outsourced to other countries because of the perception that we do not have qualified talent here in the US to fill those opportunities.""

The Bee2Bee Network Internships are the ideal solution for the young professional before or after graduation. According to Ms. Clarke, ""The longer a young professional waits to develop and or utilize his or her skills, before or after graduation, the less marketable he or she will be to the industry. In the technology industry, this lag time can be exponentially detrimental to a young professionals' future prospects"".

The Bee2Bee Network's consortium of academic and industry partners include Kathleen Lee, a national award-winning Service Learning Expert formerly of Microsoft School of the Future and top industry technology experts and instructors in the nation including Chris Sardinas of CS3 Design.

In addition, their projects are hand-picked to mirror the most in-demand skills and technologies which the market is looking for. For the small business, the Bee2Bee Network offers very sophisticated solutions for small business such as a Google Virtual Tour and social media marketing tools from vendor partners from Constant Contact to IBM at a very reasonable cost to local small businesses. For the intern, a Bee2Bee Network Internship guarantees that they are not grabbing coffee for the first year of their career. Instead, a Bee2Bee Network intern will have the opportunity to build their resumes and project portfolios by actually learning and working hands-on directly with industry experts and clients to solve real-world problems using the latest technologies and participating in 'Enterprise Level' projects in Web Development, Internet Broadcasting and Social Media Marketing.

According to Ms. Clarke, the ultimate vision is for all Bee2Bee Network Interns to launch their own entrepreneurial start-ups with the hands-on knowledge and ongoing support which is available to them through their year-round mentorship program. ""We need help from the business community to make this possible. A Bee2Bee Network intern is provided with their own laptops, software and customized training to fill a role of their choice in the technology industry - from software designer to coder but the business community needs to know that we are here to help.""

Participating businesses such as the Downtown at the Gardens, Whole Foods, Mercedes Benz of North Palm Beach, The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club & Spa in Jupiter, FL and Too Jays Gourmet Deli are given a Bee2Bee intern to assist with their technological needs and, in turn, they are not only funding the intern's education, but giving them the valuable experience they need to take their skills to the next level. Local sponsors also include, Whole Foods, Downtown at the Gardens, SONY, Best Buy, Office Depot, Bella Fierce Entertainment and Cobb Theatres.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are directly linked to creating strong, economically sustainable communities,” Clarke said. “Our program continues to emphasize the importance of these businesses in our community as well as the development of our youth.”

With the tagline “Doing Good is Good Business,” the Bee2Bee Network believes in the power of giving back. Once involved in the program, all participants are expected to “pay it forward” and share their new found skills with family and members of the community.

Their next HIVE project has been approved by the town Celebration, Florida and is slated for commencement after the New Year. The Bee2Bee Network plans to continue pollinating businesses across the country with plans to start a new hive in Philadelphia at ABO Haven Inc. in 2014. According to Yasmine Clarke, founder, ""We are investing in “Futures” because “doing good is good business.”

NewsDay,Obama pledges up to $5 billion to global infectious-diseases fund,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama pledged on Monday to give up to $5 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria over the next three years, saying an ""AIDS-free generation"" may be within reach.

The pledge represents $1 billion more than the United States committed during the previous round of funding in 2010, when Obama faced criticism for not doing enough and setting a bad example that gave other countries an excuse to limit their donations.

The $5 billion contribution, the amount activists asked for, will be met if other countries commit to giving $10 billion, as per a 1-to-2 funding ratio set by Congress.

""We're making progress,"" Obama said at a White House event marking World AIDS Day, which was Sunday. ""But we're all here today because we know how much work remains to be done.""

Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Germany and France announced separately that they had raised their contributions to the Global Fund, which was created in 2002 to coordinate international efforts to fight infectious disease in low-income countries. It now provides more than 20 percent of resources for HIV treatment and prevention.

The announcements represent a redoubling of global efforts to fight AIDS.

Despite billions spent on research in the 34 years since the virus was recognized, a vaccine has eluded scientists, and efforts to stop the spread of the disease through preventive measures, such as microbial gels, have been unexpectedly challenging. One million Americans are living with AIDS today.

NewsDay,Ryan: We can end AIDS without finding a cure,"NEW YORK - This Dec. 1, as we mark yet another World AIDS Day without a cure, a vaccine, or an intelligently interdependent global response to the crisis, I'd like to propose a thought experiment based on a radical - yet commonsense - proposition: We can end AIDS without a cure for AIDS.

After all, we have learned ways to prevent transmission between mother and child, discovered drugs that bring the viral load down to undetectable levels, and placed a critical understanding of sexual health in the hands of (some of) those who need it most. With proper funding and political will, these advantages can be replicated in every population, in every country, in every corner of the globe. Incurable is not unbeatable - as we already know from polio and smallpox.

So why haven't we beaten AIDS? Clearly, it's not because we don't need to. In the United States alone, an estimated 1.2 million people are living with HIV. Globally, it's around 35.3 million people.

For one reason or another - because they are black or brown, gay or transgender, drug users or sex workers, and overwhelmingly because they are poor and disenfranchised - the life-or-death needs of these people do not dictate global policy or move world markets. Because AIDS has from its very beginning been a disease of the marginalized, we have allowed it to spread like a weed through the cracks in our society. Inaction, more than transmission, is at issue here. HIV causes AIDS, yes, but the AIDS crisis is caused by stigma, oppression, discrimination and apathy. The virus is not our biggest enemy - we are.

And here, the thought experiment begins.

Currently, the popular understanding of HIV/AIDS is that it is a disease that affects certain ""high-risk groups"": gay men, for instance, or black women. To be sure, rates of infection among these groups are disproportionately high, as any number of depressing statistics show.

According to recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control, approximately 30,000 men who have sex with men (MSMs) contracted HIV in 2010 - up a significant 12 percent from 2008. While infection rates among black women seem to have fallen recently, they are still 20 times higher than those of white women. Such strong correlations between racial or sexual identities and infection rates suggest that this model is informative, that it is an accurate way to understand the AIDS crisis.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But these statistics conceal as much as they seem to reveal. In three distinct ways, the ""risk group"" approach to conceptualizing HIV actually impedes efforts to end the crisis. First, it pathologizes all people within a broad category, regardless of their actual sero-status or real likelihood of contracting HIV. Under this simplistic rubric, all gay men or black women or injection drug users are treated as likely sources of infection.

Second, this approach diminishes our ability to properly understand and target the real vectors for the disease by hiding them inside nearly useless categories. After all, there is nothing inherent to being a black woman that makes one more likely to contract HIV. It is the social position of black womanhood in our society that puts these women at risk, not their identities.

Third, by leading us to believe that these broad groupings have some causal relationship to HIV infection, this model limits our understanding of the crisis to our local context. Because we are actually dealing with correlation, not causation, these groupings do not have the same relationship to HIV in other places. Efforts to work globally - or even in different communities in America - will always be hampered by our own preconceived notions of who is and is not at risk.

But what if we flipped the lens? What if we focused more on marginalization (and its real-world effects) and less on identities? What if we understood AIDS not as a disease affecting certain types of people, but rather, as a disease that affects those living at the intersection of a constellation of conditions, such as poverty, lack of access to education, inadequate health care, stigmatized sexual practices, drug and alcohol abuse (legal or illegal) and political disenfranchisement? This would not only reduce the stigmatization of identity groups with high rates of HIV infection, it would also allow us to tailor our health remedies to those who really are most at-risk.

For example, in a further breakdown of that statistic regarding rates of infection among MSMs, the CDC notes that the numbers of new infections among white and black MSMs were almost identical - despite the fact that non-Latino whites represent 63 percent of the U.S. population and blacks only 12 percent.

Additionally, the greatest number of infections was seen in the youngest age group. Again and again, it is those who sit at the intersection of marginalized identities - those with the least social capital and political agency - who are most at risk. We must discard generic categorical bromides in favor of health remedies targeted to their specific needs.

Further, this way of understanding the crisis would turn our attention away from prevention models based solely on behavioral change, which studies have shown are often difficult to enact in real life. Though it is tempting to isolate a single action or inaction that could stem the tide of infection, in truth, we are complex social animals whose behaviors arise from our specific circumstances and experiences. Thus, without broader contextual shifts, our actions tend to be change resistant.

For example, behavioral models routinely admonish young women with little education, no access to health care, and a cultural lack of sexual agency to make difficult decisions in highly sexual situations. In an (oversimplified) metaphor, it's like telling someone to use a condom every time they have sex - without considering where they will get the condom, who their partners are, how they will negotiate safer sex acts, what the word sex means to them, and so on. A more successful (and, to be blunt, fair) approach would be to ensure that these women are empowered to enter these situations with adequate support, knowledge, and decision-making agency - things marginalized groups often lack.

This requires HIV prevention efforts that also work to create political power for marginalized groups; address issues of poverty and social justice; help individuals find or prepare for meaningful employment, housing, and health care; address mental health issues - efforts, in effect, that address a client's life circumstances as a whole. Many, many on-the-ground service providers already work in this kind of model. But this is a long and slow process, which requires support from an informed populace and a government that sees the vital connection between civil rights, community empowerment, and HIV/AIDS.

By focusing on marginalization, not identity or behavior, we could begin to address the root causes of inequality that leave certain members of our society more at risk for experiencing any negative life or health outcome, AIDS included.

If we can stop AIDS and have chosen not to, the hard truth is that it is because certain lives don't seem worth saving: They would cost too much, or have brought it upon themselves, or aren't our concern, or don't even exist in our worldview. And this is what needs to change.

Until we see every life as equal, we will never end AIDS.

NewsDay,PositiveSingles.com Offers One Extra Month to Members with HIV/AIDS Who Upgrade In Honor of World AIDS Day,"PositiveSingles.com is offering one month free for all members who have HIV/AIDS and upgrade their account during November 30 to December 2, 2013, which is to commemorate World AIDS Day.

PositiveSingles.com has announced that they will be offering one month free for all members who have HIV/AIDS and upgrade their account during the three days of November 30 to December 2, 2013, which is in honor of World AIDS Day.

The upgrade must be done during the three days of November 30, December 1 and December 2, 2013. Members who are living with HIV/AIDS and who upgrade their memberships during those three days will get one extra month of gold membership. That is to say, they do not need to pay for this extra month.

World AIDS Day is always held on December 1 every year, and is dedicated to raising awareness about the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Annually, this is a great way for people all over the world to unite together to fight against HIV/AIDS. As the largest STD dating site, PositiveSingles.com has hundreds of thousands of members who suffer from HIV/AIDS. Each year on World AIDS Day, HIV/AIDS members like to show their tremendous gratitude to all the people who have helped them get through a difficult time, whether it is through emotional support, or financial support by donating to the cause.

To commemorate this day of awareness, some members write articles for magazines or other publications, while others may spend the day in church in remembrance of so many people who have died from HIV/AIDS. Still other members will make videos to express their feelings in an attempt to let people see how his terrible disease has affected them and raise viewers' awareness about the devastating effects.

One HIV/AIDS member on PositiveSingles.com said, “I cannot give enough gratitude to those who have this virus who continue to supply me with support and education. Despite the fact that there is no cure for our STDS, everyone on this site must be awake to the topics of Immunology and Infectious Disease, not just those of us living with HPV or AIDS, because what is fundamental depends on it.”

Stigma and discrimination still remain a reality for so many people who live with HIV/AIDS. World AIDS Day also reminds people to fight against prejudice and many people who live with this devastating illness hope that more and more people can learn about the disease on World AIDS Day.

NewsDay,Entertainment-Education Program Bolsters Ethiopian Public Health Initiative,"An independent evaluation of Population Media Center’s award-winning radio serial drama, Mieraf, has shown the program made significant contributions towards improving Ethiopian public health.

An entertainment-education radio serial drama broadcast in Ethiopia has effectively increased awareness of HIV prevention methods and modern sanitation in the country, while also familiarizing citizens with the country’s innovative public health initiative.

The award-winning program, named Mieraf (“New Beginning”), was produced by Population Media Center (PMC), a global leader in entertainment-education. It was broadcast in Ethiopia twice a week from June 2010 through December 2011.

The highly-entertaining and informative drama was designed by PMC’s Ethiopia office to support the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health’s large-scale public health initiative, known as the Health Extension Program (HEP). Launched in 2006, the health extension program employs 30,000 community-based workers, known as Health Extension Workers, to help provide essential health services at the grassroots level.

By 2010, however, authorities had realized the program’s services – which included providing family planning assistance, prevention of HIV/AIDS and malaria, and improving sanitation – were being under-utilized by Ethiopian citizens. In turn, this was causing morale to drop among the Health Extension Workers.

In order to help promote the importance of health extension workers, boost their morale and encourage people to use their services, PMC was retained to produce its flagship product – an entertainment-education behavior-change radio serial drama.

The effective use of entertainment-education in international development work hinges on the realization that emotional as well as cognitive factors influence behaviors. Specifically, social learning theory demonstrates that humans adopt many of their values and learn much of their behavior from role models. By employing local writers, actors and producers to create culturally-specific stories that show the gradual evolution of character role-models in response to real-life problems that audience members are facing, PMC’s serial dramas can facilitate the adoption of new behaviors.

The Mieraf radio serial drama was infused with highly entertaining characters, plot-twists and cliffhangers. It tells the story of Hibist, a 21-year-old-girl living with her family in a rural village in Ethiopia. Two of Hibist’s female siblings die young because of birthing complications, leaving Hibist as the only girl in a family of four living children. With very traditional parents, she struggles to find her place among her three brothers and to overcome the challenges of being female in a male-dominated society. Despite the criticism she endures from all sides, Hibist completes her 10-year education and joins the Health Extension Worker Program, where she is determined to find a way to improve the health of her family and community.

Throughout the course of the drama, Hibist is confronted with numerous challenges – her relationship with her fiancé hangs in a delicate balance; she must survive the temptations of drugs and alcohol; and she must fight against a malaria outbreak in her village by teaching her neighbors to use malaria nets and to drain dirty water from ponds and pools to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.

A UNICEF commissioned analysis of the program, completed in 2012, shows that listeners to the program were 3.6 times more likely to know about HIV prevention methods than non-listeners. Listeners were also 1.9 times more likely to know about sanitation measures than non-listeners and had better awareness of the Health Extension Program. Mieraf also won a Global Media Award for best radio serial drama.

“Awareness of the effectiveness of entertainment-education initiatives in promoting health and human rights objectives continues to build in the international development community,” said Bill Ryerson, founder and president of PMC. “In addition to being highly effective as stand-alone interventions, the strong results from Mieraf should further reinforce the notion that behavior change serial dramas can also be leveraged as powerful supplements to both new and existing development initiatives.”

About Population Media Center (PMC):

Population Media Center (PMC) is a nonprofit, international nongovernmental organization, which strives to improve the health and well-being of people around the world through the use of entertainment-education strategies, like serialized dramas on radio and television, in which characters evolve into role models for the audience for positive behavior change. Founded in 1998, PMC has over 15 years of field experience using the Sabido methodology of behavior change communications, impacting more than 50 countries around the world.

NewsDay,The STI Clinic to Offer Comprehensive Screening for MSM,"The STI Clinic, a licensed sexual health testing website, announces the introduction of a comprehensive STI screen targeted at men who have sex with men (MSM).

The STI Clinic is now offering two additional sexual health tests aimed at MSM. Results are communicated to patients in as little as 24 hours after the sample arrives to the lab. The tests can be purchased online at: http://www.thesticlinic.com.

The STI Clinic is a recognised website where people can order their sexual health test discretely online, provide a sample at home and view their results online by logging onto a secure portal. The online sexual health screen provider has just launched two new types of tests aimed at men who have sex with men (MSM).

These two types of screening will test for multiple infections in multiple areas of the body, namely, the pharyngeal, genital and rectal areas. Patients will also be asked to provide a small blood sample to test for HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B and C. Testing is conducted by an accredited laboratory and results are highly reliable.

The STI Clinic has launched these two new test profiles because it is recognised that MSM have a higher risk of contracting infections and have specific testing requirements. These tests are targeted at male patients who have sex with other men but can be ordered by anybody who wants to get tested for the same infections.

Robert MacKay, the founder of The STI Clinic, said:

“In 2012, 79% of all syphilis infections and 58% of all gonorrhoea infections were among MSM. 22% of MSM gonorrhoea infections were rectal and 20% were pharyngeal only. Traditional testing from a urine sample would not be able to detect these infections. Our new MSM screens are the most comprehensive sexual health tests available online. We hope that the accessibility of these tests will encourage more people to come forward to get tested and ultimately lead to a reduction in STIs in the MSM population”.

----------------

The STI Clinic is an online platform that allows individuals to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through an accredited laboratory without making a trip to the clinic. The goal of The STI Clinic is to deliver a service that is fast and reliable. It achieves these aims by offering same-day dispatch of the chosen test kit and laboratory-based testing with a quick turnaround time.

NewsDay,The Most Effective Way to Learn a Foreign Language,"International Volunteers through CrossContinental.org Recently Shared Their Secrets for Learning a New Language Based on Their Firsthand Experience Abroad

Countless people struggle when trying to learn a foreign language. Many fail to acquire conversational proficiency even after years of classes. College students often spend a great deal of time and tuition to meet the language requirements for their degrees. Fortunately, there is a better way to learn a new language that takes students out of the classroom as recent volunteers through CrossContinental.org can attest.

In the attached video (http://youtu.be/_9q_nOfcCg0), 18-year-old Claire Lingham from Boston USA shares how her volunteer abroad experience contributed greatly to her success when learning Mandarin Chinese. After spending only 4 months in China, Claire's Chinese language skills went from only knowing how to name a few colors to having full conversations with locals without resorting to English.

Claire found the program online when she was researching gap year programs. She chose it because of its flexibility and uniqueness. She wanted to go to rural China in order to fully immerse herself in Chinese culture and experience traditional Chinese festivals. She wanted to do part time volunteer work and stay with a local family because her primary goal during her 4 month program was to learn Chinese. In the end, she was amazed by the progress she made while living in China.

""It has been really amazing teaching English here and I've learned so much Chinese,"" Claire exclaims. ""My Chinese has gone from basic color words to actually having conversations with [my host family's] mother who doesn't speak any English. So, I think that is pretty good.""

The host family contributed greatly to her rapid language acquisition, and the immersive cultural experience was just the icing on the cake. Claire states, ""I've had an incredible time here teaching the kids and learning Chinese. My host family has been really like a family to me. Living here in China, rural China, where there are no other foreigners, and where people are so welcoming and so heart-warming, has been amazing.""

Such linguistic success is mirrored by many other volunteers who have traveled to Latin America to enhance their Spanish. Working and living side by side with locals seems to be a far more effective means for learning a language than one’s typical language class experience. International volunteers not only get to fine-tune a second language, but also gain intercultural experience and valuable volunteer hours as well.

NewsDay,Study: Hepatitis Linked to Fibromyalgia; polyDNA Recommends Gene-Eden-VIR Against Latent HCV and HBV,"A study published on September 25 in The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine found that Fibromyalgia (FM) “prevalence was found to be as high as 25% in a single study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers (1).” polyDNA recommends Gene-Eden-VIR to help the immune system target the latent HCV and HBV.

Patients with life-long infections of the hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses tend to develop Fibromyalgia (FM). “(FM) is a syndrome characterized by widespread and chronic musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, morning stiffness, and sleep disturbance. The condition affects middle-aged women, in particular, and FM prevalence in the general population is thought to be as high as 2% (1).” However, “the prevalence of FM is higher in patients with Lyme disease, and those with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (1).” In addition, “FM prevalence was found to be as high as 25% in a single study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers (1).” Compare the numbers, 2% in the general population versus 25% in hepatitis B patients.

Researchers found that Fibromyalgia was more prevalent in those with a latent HBV infection. “The prevalence of FM in inactive hepatitis B carriers were 23%. We also found, for the first time, that the frequency of FM in chronic active hepatitis patients was 21% (1).”

This means that those with Fibromyalgia need a remedy specifically designed to target the latent hepatitis virus. Gene-Eden-VIR is such a remedy.

“For a long time, we’ve said that latent viruses can cause disease. These findings provide evidence to substantiate this belief.” – Mike Evans, polyDNA

A study published on August 12, 2013 in the peer reviewed, medical journal Pharmacology & Pharmacy, in a special edition on Advances in Antiviral Drugs, showed that Gene-Eden-VIR reduced hepatitis symptoms. Study authors wrote that, “Individuals infected with HCV…reported a safe decrease in their symptoms following treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR (2).” The study authors also wrote that, “We observed a statistically significant decrease in the severity, duration, and frequency of symptoms (2).”

NewsDay,World AIDS Day 2013: Technology can help shift the HIV response to the community level,"Already moving HIV prevention and treatment to the community level has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in the countries that have made this move, avoided thousands of unnecessary hospitalisations and allowed much more rapid diagnosis and treatment for millions, said Dr Denis Broun, Executive Director of UNITAID.

To cover most people living with HIV with full access to treatment within the amount of resources available today and with a fully funded Global Fund, it is essential that activities for appropriate prevention, detection, treatment and surveillance of HIV infection are performed at the community level, said Dr Denis Broun, Executive Director of UNITAID.

“Already moving HIV prevention and treatment to the community level has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in the countries that have made this move, avoided thousands of unnecessary hospitalisations and allowed much more rapid diagnosis and treatment for millions,” said Dr Broun. “Further cost-savings can be gained if we move laboratory-based diagnosis to communities by using technology adapted for the point of care.”

UNITAID has already invested $140 million in portable and easy-to-use HIV diagnostic technology. These tools can monitor a person’s immune system strength and also use molecular-based testing to measure the amount of HIV in the body, today’s standard for evaluating the efficacy of treatment.

“Community health workers can use these devices to manage a person’s response to HIV treatment, without having to refer anyone to distant urban hospitals,” said Dr Broun. “Importantly, they can determine if people are adhering to treatment correctly or if stronger medicines are required – an essential part of any chronic disease management.”

This World AIDS Day, UNITAID is announcing an additional $20 million in grants to diagnostics developers of these innovative new tools. This is the first time ever that UNITAID is providing direct subsidies to manufacturers to expedite the evaluation and registration of new machines. These grants will bring more products to market more quickly and will also increase the number of countries these technologies will be available in.

“The aim of these new grants is to create a sustainable and competitive market for these products,” added Dr Broun. “We want to make these technologies affordable, for high-burden countries.”

UNITAID funding is already allowing its implementers Médecins Sans Frontières, the Clinton Health Access Initiative and UNICEF to roll out new tools in the heart of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, notably in Eastern and Southern Africa where HIV prevalence rates are often above 10-20% of the population. In Mozambique, remote districts are receiving compact immune system monitoring devices that allow people to receive test results the same day instead of months later. In Malawi, new methods are being tested to provide monitoring services to remote communities, including the first “point-of-care” device in clinical use to measure the amount of HIV in the blood. Meanwhile, in West Africa, UNITAID is funding France Expertise Internationale to stimulate market entry of new HIV monitoring tools.

“Our efforts to provide better quality of care at the community level – for affordable prices – are critical. It is essential that other donors target their investments in a similar way,” concluded Dr Broun.

NewsDay,Sentinel Offender Services Gives Back to the Community with Help From Employee Volunteers,"Sentinel’s Corporate Responsibility Program supports their local communities through employee participation in charity walks, food and toy drives, and other volunteer efforts. This holiday season the corporate office in Irvine, California maintains its support of Crittenton Services for Children and Families based in Fullerton, California.

Sentinel Offender Services, a national provider of offender management services, is continuing their tradition of supporting local charities through employee volunteer efforts. With 58 offices nationwide and approximately 450 employees, Sentinel’s Corporate Responsibility Program encourages staff to participate in charity walks, food and toy drives, and other volunteer efforts that support their local communities.

With the holidays having arrived, charities nationwide are in desperate need of donations to make it a happy holiday season for all children in need. Crittenton Services for Children and Families (CSCF) based in Fullerton, California is one of the foundations that Sentinel supports. Founded in 1966, Crittenton provides a full array of residential, in-home, community based, foster care, and advocacy programs and services throughout Southern California.

For over six years, Sentinel’s Irvine office has participated in CSCF’s popular holiday gift drive known as The Angel Tree Program. This 15-year-old program collects new toys and clothes, gift cards, toiletries, and stocking stuffers on behalf of families and children served by Crittenton. The program runs from October to early December and over 750 children in all departments of Crittenton Services rely on the kindness of the public for their holiday gifts. Sentinel aims to provide 100 gifts every year to CSCF—a goal they will meet again this year and are on track to surpass.

Pat Williams, Angel Tree Program Coordinator and CSCF Volunteer stated “The larger gift that Sentinel brings to our children is the knowledge that someone cares. Our children struggle to understand the concept that total strangers would want to do something so kind for them and expect nothing in return. They have not known people like you [Sentinel employees] before. You are such a blessing.”

The Angel Tree Program connects one child at a time to each caring donor through their simple and specific wishes. Group home children, refugees, human trafficking victims, and children who have experienced all forms of abuse will receive personalized Christmas gifts from Sentinel employees.

On the other side of the ocean, Sentinel employees located in the state of Georgia were at their finest this past October supporting both local and national charities.

These employees, with their families and friends, participated in the Augusta Miracle Mile Walk for breast cancer. The group raised money in support of breast cancer research that affects 1 in 8 women over the course of their lifetime. About 85 percent of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. Employees who worked at the Sentinel office showed their solidarity by wearing their gray and pink shirts to work which read “Time to Tackle Breast Cancer. Sentinel Walking for a Cure.”

Also in October, the Georgia team gathered together their friends and family to participate in Douglasville’s annual AIDS walk. More than 1.1 million people in the United States are living with HIV infection, and almost 1 in 5 (18.1 percent) are unaware of their infection. The employees raised money, including Sentinel matching their donation. Douglasville Office Manager Seth Gholston says the staff is also working toward collecting canned food items to donate to a food bank and toys for children.

Crittenton Services for Children and Families (CSCF) is a non-profit social services agency whose mission is to heal the wounds of abuse and neglect; strengthen families; and help troubled adolescents reach their full potential. They provide a full array of residential, in-home, community based, wraparound, mental health, foster care, and adoption services with a service planning area throughout Southern California.

Sentinel Offender Services, a privately held company, will celebrate 20 years in business this December. In the two decades since its inception, over 500,000 misdemeanants have participated in programs designed to keep probationers out of jail, reduce recidivism, and aid correctional agencies in the effort to manage their offender populations.

NewsDay,"Multivitamins May Help Fight HIV Progression, Study Suggests","New research from Africa suggests that basic multivitamin and selenium supplements might greatly lower the risk that untreated people with the AIDS virus will get sicker over a two-year period.

It's not clear how patients who take the vitamins and mineral might fare over longer periods. And the impact of the study in the United States will be limited because many Americans diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, immediately begin treatment with powerful medications known as anti-retroviral drugs. Those in the African study hadn't yet begun taking drugs to keep the virus at bay.

Still, ""it is incredibly useful to find new strategies to delay the progression of HIV disease,"" said Dr. Jared Baeten, an associate professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle who's familiar with the findings. ""Not every HIV-infected person is immediately willing, or able, to initiate anti-retroviral therapy. Inexpensive, proven treatments ahead of starting anti-retroviral therapy can fill an important role.""

At issue: Do HIV-infected people benefit from nutritional supplements? Previous research has suggested that even well-fed people infected with HIV may not properly process nutrients in food, said study author Marianna Baum, a professor of dietetics and nutrition at Florida International University's Stempel School of Public Health.

The researchers wondered whether the immune system would get a boost if patients who hadn't yet begun anti-retroviral treatment took nutritional supplements. No study had looked at this before, Baum noted.

For the study, published in the Nov. 27 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the researchers divided nearly 900 HIV-infected patients in the African country of Botswana into several groups. Some took a placebo, a sugar pill with no active ingredients. Others took a multivitamin including B, C and E vitamins. Another group took the multivitamin along with supplements of the mineral selenium, and still others took only selenium.

None of the treatments had a noticeable effect except the combination of multivitamin and selenium. After adjusting their statistics so they wouldn't be thrown off by various factors, the researchers reported that those who took the combination were about half as likely to show signs over two years that their infection had progressed toward AIDS as those who took the placebo.

Overall, the risk that the disease would progress over the two years of the study was fairly low: 32 of the 217 who took the placebo suffered progression of the disease, she said, compared to 17 of the 220 who took the vitamin/mineral combination.

Baum didn't have information about the costs of the supplements, but she said they are low. In the United States, supplements that contain many vitamins and minerals can cost just pennies a day.

The supplements appeared to have no side effects, said Baum, who recommends that people newly diagnosed with HIV begin taking multivitamins. They seem to boost the immune system, she said. The selenium supplements, in particular, may provide enough of the mineral that the virus isn't able to hog it, she said.

Baeten cautioned that not just any multivitamin will do. ""The results of this study appear to illustrate that it is not just any supplement,"" he said.

""Only the combination of vitamins plus selenium was effective,"" Baeten said. ""For U.S. patients, this latter point is relevant, as there's a huge variety of supplements available. I would suggest talking with a doctor before taking any supplements.""

He added that the study doesn't detract from the crucial importance of anti-retroviral drug treatment.

Researchers next want to see if the supplements help patients already taking anti-retroviral medications, study author Baum said.

NewsDay,Talking Openly With Partner Linked to HIV Testing in Teens,"Teens who are in committed relationships and have good communication with their partner are among those most likely to get tested for HIV, a new study finds.

Researchers surveyed 980 sexually active teens aged 14 to 17 in the Bronx, where there is a high rate of AIDS. They found that 44 percent of the teens had been tested for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Further analysis showed that 60 percent of those who have good HIV-related communication with their partner had been tested. The same was true for 54 percent of those in committed relationships, and 48 percent of those who had good communication and were comfortable discussing sex with their partners.

Overall, teens who had high HIV/AIDS-related communication with their parnters were 3.7 times more likely to have been tested for HIV than those with low levels of partner communication, according to the findings in the November issue of the journal AIDS Patient Care and STDs.

Teens who had more knowledge about HIV and engaged in risky sexual activity were not more likely than other teens to get tested for HIV, the investigators found. This group included teens who knew more about HIV and understood how the virus is transmitted, as well as protection and treatment methods.

""Despite efforts to educate about the risks of HIV and AIDS in schools, it is clear that more is needed to prompt adolescents to speak up and take the next step of getting tested,"" study author Dr. Hina Talib, an adolescent medicine physician at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, said in a college news release.

""Early identification of HIV in adolescents is associated with earlier treatment and better health outcomes, so it is especially important that these sexually active high school-aged adolescents be tested,"" noted Talib, who is also an assistant professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.

""These findings highlight opportunities for health care providers to include a discussion of the partner's testing status when counseling adolescents about HIV testing,"" Talib said. Programs to encourage HIV testing in the teens who need it most should be designed to include partner communication methods, she suggested in the news release.

NewsDay,"HealthCrave's Dermatologist, Dr. Chad Hivnor, Receives Paul W. Myers Award","On September 16, 2013 Dermatologist Lt. Col. (Dr.) Chad Hivnor was presented with the 2013 Paul W. Myers award at the Air Force Association's annual Air and Space Conference in Washington D.C.

HealthCrave is proud to announce their very own Dr. Chad Hivnor’s success in obtaining The Paul W. Myers Award. Formally known as the Clinical Surgeons Award, it became the Paul W. Myers Award in honor of retired Lt. Gen. Paul W. Myers for his 45 years of active membership within the society of Air Force Clinical Surgeons. The prestigious award is reserved for the Air Force medical corps officer who has made significant contributions in the health care of men and women serving in the United States Air Force.

Chad M. Hivnor, M.D., is a Board Certified Dermatologist fellowship trained in dermatologic surgery. Dr. Hivnor received extensive training in laser medicine and surgery and has treated many wounded warriors. He specializes in the care of scars.

Dr. Hivnor graduated from the US Air Force Academy with a BS in Biochemistry, with distinguished honors. He then attended the University of Texas Health Science Center where he received his medical degree. He completed his residency in Dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Hivnor then returned to San Antonio where he served as Staff Dermatologist at Lackland Air Force Base.

Dr. Hivnor is one of the nation's foremost laser experts in the country. He has done extensive research in lasers, cosmetics, onychomycosis (toe nail fungus), skin cancer, and scars. He was also awarded a $1.1 million dollar grant to collaborate with Harvard University to study lasers’ effects on scars and functional improvement after scars and surgery. Dr. Hivnor was the dermatologist who treated many wounded warriors at Wilford Hall and Lackland Air Force Base and is known for using innovative techniques on scars and burns for both the military and civilian population.

Dr. Hivnor's superb work with lasers, which serve to improve skin texture and flexibility on burn wounds and amputee scars on wounded warriors, made him an easy choice to receive the honor. He says of his laser technique ""By using a carbon dioxide laser, a number of wounded warriors were able to be treated for their burns and scars, to include leg amputations,"" Hivnor stated. ""We were then able to increase the sweat and decrease hair which causes frictional folliculitis, a skin condition caused by inflammation of hair follicles due to the prosthetics. We're really helping the wounded warriors to assimilate back into society."" Dr. Hivnor is thrilled to now be able to offer these treatments, among others, to the civilian population at HealthCrave Medical Centers.

NewsDay,New Clues to How Long-Term Drug Therapy Keeps HIV at Bay,"A new study suggests that the replication of HIV may slow or stop altogether in patients who are on long-term treatment, although remnants can still lurk in the body.

And the researchers now suspect that the virus is especially weak in those people who started treatment immediately after becoming infected.

The study is very small, involving just eight patients. However, the findings add more evidence to the debate over how soon patients should begin drug treatment after they're diagnosed as being infected with HIV. One of the study authors is ready to say that treatment must begin immediately.

""Patients should be started on therapy as soon as they are diagnosed to prevent the virus from hiding in large numbers of cells,"" said the researcher, Sarah Palmer, deputy director of the Center for Virus Research at Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, in Australia. ""Diagnosing HIV infection early and initiating therapy immediately is crucial for limiting the number of cells containing HIV.""

While doctors can use drugs to kill the AIDS virus in the body, it's impossible to eliminate it completely. That means there's no cure for HIV infection or AIDS, the potentially deadly condition that the virus causes.

But what does the virus do when a patient is on medication -- does it keep replicating [making copies of itself] or does it hide? The authors of the new study sought to find an answer by analyzing immune-system cells taken from eight HIV-infected patients. All had been taking anti-HIV drug treatment for years.

This combined drug treatment is known as antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The researchers analyzed the cells and found that drug treatment appeared to stop the virus from replicating -- an important finding that suggests a possible weakness. However, HIV didn't vanish but instead hid in certain types of immune-system cells known as ""resting memory T cells."" These cells ""remember"" how to fight a particular body invader, such as a germ or virus and sit around waiting for it to return.

""These cells can remain dormant for many years even though they are carrying HIV,"" Palmer said. ""When these cells start to replicate or are stimulated to replicate as part of our normal immune response, they also produce HIV, keeping the virus viable. Essentially, these cells are a ticking time bomb in patients, and once they are ignited they explosively produce HIV.""

This finding confirms previous research showing that the lurking virus is ""very stable for years,"" said David Schaffer, director of the Berkeley Stem Cell Center at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It means that treatments must be developed to directly eliminate this long-lived pool, which is challenging,"" said Schaffer, who is familiar with the study's findings.

However, there's some good news. The numbers of these cells were smaller in patients who had started treatment soon after being diagnosed instead of waiting until they began to show symptoms.

""Diagnosing HIV infection early and initiating therapy immediately is crucial for limiting the number of cells containing HIV,"" Palmer said. ""The scientific community must develop better strategies to flush HIV from its hiding place in patients without causing new infections.""

Schaffer agreed. A treatment can't just halt the virus from growing in the body and wait for the infected cells -- the ""latent pool"" -- to die out, he said. ""Finding a cure for HIV means that therapies must be developed to directly eliminate the latent pool of virus.""

The study will appear online in this week's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

NewsDay,Allsup Observes World AIDS Day 25th Anniversary,"Raises Awareness of HIV-Related Disabilities and SSDI Eligibility

Allsup, a nationwide Social Security Disability Insurance(SSDI) representation company, is joining with thousands of other organizations worldwide to mark the 25th anniversary of World Aids Day Dec. 1, 2013. More than 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, according to AIDS.gov.

Not everyone who has HIV will develop AIDS, which is the final stage of HIV infection. However, individuals with HIV are susceptible to multiple complications due to a suppressed immune system. These complications include bacterial, fungal, protozoan and viral infections as well as cancers, lymphomas, blood disorders and neurological abnormalities. If individuals living with HIV are unable to continue working due to a physical or mental impairment, they may be eligible for federal disability programs, including SSDI.

SSDI is a federally mandated insurance program funded by FICA payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers. It provides monthly income to individuals who are under full retirement age (age 65 or older) and who can no longer work because of a severe disability expected to last for more than 12 months or is terminal.

“The diagnosis of HIV itself does not mean an individual is disabled,” said Ed Swierczek, senior claimant representative at Allsup. “It is the impact of the disease process on the individual that determines whether HIV is disabling.”

Conditions related to HIV that often make a return to work impossible include:



End stage renal disease. Up to 30 percent of people living with HIV have abnormal kidney function, which can lead to the complete or almost complete failure of the kidneys.

Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Antiretroviral therapy helps people living with HIV/AIDS live longer, healthier lives, but some HIV medications can increase the risk for heart disease and diabetes by causing high cholesterol levels and insulin resistance.

HIV-associated dementia /AIDS dementia complex (ADC). HIV can affect the central nervous system and an individual’s ability to think and function. This may cause poor concentration, memory loss, slowed movements, lack of coordination, mental slowness, difficulty learning new things, confusion and depression.

Acute respiratory failure. This accounts for approximately 25-50 percent of intensive care unit admissions for people with HIV disease.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has an extensive medical listing (14.08) that addresses HIV. This provides the guidelines one must meet to receive Social Security disability benefits at step three of its five-step evaluation process.

“If an individual does not meet any of the criteria in medical listing 14.08, then the SSA will assess residual functional capacity to determine if he or she has the ability to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” said Swierczek. SSA defines “substantial gainful activity” as the ability to work and earn at least $1,040 per month in 2013.

Their recent project is a collaboration with Google to create the first online virtual mall in the country at Downtown at the Gardens in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Their next HIVE project has been approved by the town Celebration, Florida and is slated for commencement after the new year. The Bee2Bee Network plans to continue pollinating businesses across the country with plans to start a new hive in Philadelphia at ABO Haven Inc. in 2014.

“Having the appropriate skills and knowledge in the technology industry will only further assist a student’s chances for success,” said Bee2Bee Network Founder Yasmine Clarke. Ms. Clarke founded the Bee2Bee Network after a 20-year career in the software industry. For over a decade, she has taught the Agile Software Methodology and coached software teams for corporate clients like Google, Disney, MTV, American Express, Kaiser Permanente and Johnson & Johnson.

According to Ms. Clarke, “The Bee2Bee Network Internships are the ideal solution for the young professional before or after graduation. Our projects are hand-picked to mirror the most in-demand skills and technologies which the market is looking for. For the small business, we are offering the most sophisticated solution that the market has to offer at a very reasonable cost and for the intern, a Bee2Bee Network Internship guarantees that they are not grabbing coffee for the first year of their career. Instead, our interns have the opportunity to build their resumes and project profiles by actually learning and working hands-on directly with our industry experts and clients to solve real-world problems using the latest technologies and participating in 'Enterprise Level' projects in Web Development, Internet Broadcasting and Social Media Marketing. It is a “win-win” for everyone involved.""

Participating businesses such as the Downtown at the Gardens, Whole Foods, Mercedes Benz of North Palm Beach, The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club & Spa in Jupiter, FL and Too Jays Gourmet Deli are given a Bee2Bee intern to assist with their technological needs and, in turn, they are not only funding the student’s education, but giving them the valuable experience they need to take their skills to the next level. Local sponsors also include, Whole Foods, Downtown at the Gardens, SONY, Best Buy, Office Depot, Bellafierce Entertainment and Cobb Theatres. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are directly linked to creating strong, economically sustainable communities,” Clarke said. “Our program continues to emphasize the importance of these businesses in our community as well as the development of our youth.”

Sandy property tax relief could be on way

The Town of Huntington plans to hold an early morning public hearing next month to consider adopting a law to provide assessment and tax relief to property owners impacted by superstorm Sandy.

Because the town's assessment for taxes for 2012 were done before Sandy, many homeowners were forced to live in homes that were damaged or uninhabitable. Even though the homes were unusable, property owners who experienced substantial damage to their homes were still required to pay their normal property tax bill in 2013.

""It's for people who had damage and were not able to utilize their home,"" Town Supervisor Frank Petrone said. ""We have about 400 homes in the township that probably will qualify.""

The state enacted the Super Storm Sandy Assessment Relief act earlier this year. The act says municipalities can elect and adopt a law that grants assessment relief to those impacted and grant them a rebate of their taxes based on a formula established by the state. The basis of the formula will use the amount of damage as a scale to determine the rebate.

""According to the law, we have a schedule to follow on promulgating our own law,"" Petrone said. ""That's why we are having a public hearing. We have to do it and enact it the same day in order to meet a deadline."" The hearing will be held Dec. 6 at 9 a.m. at town hall.

WEST SAYVILLE

Museum to expand volunteer program

The Long Island Maritime Museum is expanding its volunteer program with a local nonprofit that works with people with intellectual disabilities, mental illness and traumatic brain injuries.

Participants from the Old Bethpage-based Family Residences and Essential Enterprises program will volunteer at the museum in West Sayville twice a week as part of the museum's ""Collections Care Crew.""

The program will be expanded in the spring so that area school districts can send their special education students to participate in the crew, which washes, polishes and maintains the museum's collection of wooden boats.

An initial program ran from May through October.

""FREE's collaboration with Long Island Maritime Museum has been highly beneficial to our individuals, and we look forward to growing the volunteerism program to imbue others with greater self-esteem and the importance of teamwork and communication so that they become work-ready,"" said FREE's chief executive, Robert Budd.

Stephen Jones, Long Island Maritime Museum's executive director, said officials have felt ""fortunate to have the FREE 'Collections Care Crew' with us for the season! This well-supervised group was always there week in and week out, keeping our Small Craft Building and the 60 display vessels within the building in top shape."" He said the old wooden boats require extra care to maintain them properly, and they appreciate the crew's work. ""We look forward to having them back in the spring.""

RONKONKOMA

Turkeys collected for vets, military families

Adding to the tables and shelves filled with boxes of stuffing and nonperishables, Michele and Scott Beauchamp dropped off two turkeys, a ham and all the fixings.

They were among the families that stopped by Boots on the Ground's Veteran Activity Center in Ronkonkoma to donate turkeys and other thanksgiving items on Saturday.

Boots on the Ground, run by military veterans, collected 40 turkeys Saturday and would later deliver the food to veterans.

Members of the organization had taken the Beauchamp family under their wing after Army veteran Scott Beauchamp, 44, was injured by a roadside bomb on Dec. 28, 2010, while serving in Afghanistan. He was treated at Walter Reed for a broken back, injured left shoulder, crushed left hand and a traumatic brain injury.

""This is one of the ways we try to give back for all they did for us,"" said his wife, Michele Beauchamp, 44, of Woodmere. ""Our family wasn't forgotten, so it's important to us that other families aren't forgotten.""

Army veteran Frank Bania, president of Boots on the Ground, said the organization's main mission is to leave no veteran behind and help them get back on their feet.

""We've been collecting turkeys for three years, but this is the first time we're collecting at our new location,"" said Bania, 44, of Patchogue.

The organization will officially open the Veteran Activity Center, at 2184 Pond Rd., Unit A4, in several weeks, Bania said. It will provide a food pantry, recreational area, computer classes and veteran support programs.

Boots on the Ground will deliver Thanksgiving meals to veteran and military families again on Nov. 23, and will continue to accept donations of frozen turkeys and all the fixings on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

CENTEREACH

Afghan children sing 'Three Little Birds'

As a group of children approached Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Coscia while his Army unit provided security in Qalat, Afghanistan, recently, he began singing Bob Marley's ""Three Little Birds.""

Before he knew it, the kids -- smiling and jumping up and down -- repeated after him. The kids knew his unit, who supplied them with cases of water, food and candy.

"" 'Three Little Birds' is a great song that I've known for a long time, and it always puts me in a good mood,"" said Coscia, 30, a Centereach native, who is still deployed there and corresponded with Newsday via email. ""They don't know English, so I sung another verse and they repeated it. I gave it a shot and they sang with me.""

Jennifer Faut, who has known Coscia since middle school, said her friend has a huge heart and deserves the praise he's getting from those who watch the YouTube video, which was filmed by a fellow soldier and then shared by Coscia on Facebook.

""Joe is missing out on the first year of his daughter Gabriella's life, yet still took a few minutes out of his day to bring smiles to these children's faces who are surrounded by war every day,"" said Faut, 30, of Centereach. ""Joe has been a great friend to me, and I worry about him being over there every day. This video reminds me that he's serving a purpose and making a difference.""

The hardest part about serving his third tour in the Middle East is missing holidays with his wife Michelle -- whom he married last year -- and his daughter. He hasn't been there for many of the 8-month-old's ""firsts,"" Coscia, who has been serving in the Army for 11 years and now resides in Killeen, Texas, said.

AMITYVILLE

Dominican Village to refinance $18M bond

Dominican Village, the not-for-profit assisted living community in Amityville, will refinance an $18 million bond issue from the late 1990s in a move to lower operating costs.

The refinance will be done through a local development corporation whose board members, taken from the Babylon Town Industrial Development Agency, were appointed at Monday's Town Board meeting.

The move does not use any taxpayer dollars, said Robert Stricoff, Babylon IDA chief.

Dominican Village is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Dominic. The original bonds funded construction and improvements to the 150-unit facility, Stricoff said.

AMITYVILLE

Trustees to consider term limits bill

Amityville trustees will consider a bill to limit their own terms but have backed away from one that would have limited the term of the village justice.

Judge Debra Urbano-DiSalvo, the village justice, had threatened to sue over that measure, which she said would have unconstitutionally infringed on her office.

""We have had threats of a lawsuit,"" Mayor James Wandell said at Monday night's board meeting, announcing that the bill had been stricken from the agenda. ""While we believe we were on sound legal ground, we do not wish to spend money on a lawsuit to defend a principle.""

That bill would have limited the village justice to three four-year terms. A bill that would limit trustees, including the mayor, to two consecutive four-year terms, is set for a public hearing at the Dec. 9 board meeting.

""I'm glad the board recognized this was beyond their powers to do,"" Urbano-DiSalvo said in an interview yesterday. ""I hope the board, going forward, spends its energy on matters that will improve the quality of life for village residents.""

Trustees scheduled the hearing for the remaining term limits bill by a 3-1 vote, with Kevin Smith dissenting and Dennis Siry absent.

Trustee Nick LaLota and Mayor Jim Wandell have said the term limits bills were written to discourage people from making a career out of public office, and Deputy Mayor Jessica Bernius has joined them in support of the measures.

Siry has said he opposes term limits because they take authority away from voters.",19/11/2013

Obama Nominates Health Care Law Backer To Be Surgeon General

An early supporter and advocate for the Affordable Care Act has been nominated by President Barack Obama to be the country's next surgeon general.

Dr. Vivek Murthy is founder and president of Doctors for America, a group that campaigned for the controversial health care law before Congress passed it in 2010. He is a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, The New York Times reported.

He also has been a leader in HIV prevention and AIDS education in both the U.S. and India.

Murthy ""will be a powerful messenger"" on health policy, according to a statement release Thursday by White House spokesman Jay Carney. His nomination is subject to Senate approval.

The previous surgeon general, Dr. Regina Benjamin, left her post in July to return to work at a clinic she founded in Bayou La Batre, Ala. Since then, Dr. Boris Lushniak has been acting surgeon general, The Times reported.

New Drug for Rare Blood Cancer Approved by FDA

A new drug to treat a rare and aggressive form of blood cancer was approved Wednesday by the Food and Drug Administration.

Imbruvica was approved for patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have already undergone at least one previous drug treatment. This type of cancer typically begins in the lymph nodes but has usually spread to the bone marrow and other parts of the body by the time it's diagnosed, the Associated Press reported.

The new once-a-day capsule blocks a protein that enables the cancer to multiply and spread. The FDA's approval is based on a study of 111 patients. Tumors shrank or disappeared in 66 percent of the patients who took Imbruvica. However, it's not clear if the drug actually prolongs patients lives.

The new drug from Pharmacyclics and Janssen Biotech Inc. is the second to be approved under the FDA's breakthrough designation, which was approved by Congress last year. The classification is meant to accelerate development of promising drugs by giving companies additional meetings and earlier communication with FDA scientists, the AP reported.",18/11/2013
NewsDay,'Dallas Buyers Club' review: Matthew McConaughey is Oscar-worthy,"The last time most viewers saw Matthew McConaughey was in last year's stripper comedy ""Magic Mike,"" when he played a strutting slab of beef named, coincidentally, Dallas. Prepare yourself for a shock: In the new biopic ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" McConaughey has shed nearly 50 pounds to play a real-life AIDS victim. At something like a third of his normal weight (the 6-foot-tall actor reportedly plummeted to 135 pounds), McConaughey is almost literally a shadow of his former self.

He is also twice the actor he's ever been, delivering the performance of his career as Ron Woodroof, a homophobic Texan diagnosed with HIV in 1985. This somewhat fictionalized version of Woodroof is a foul-mouthed sleazeball addicted to cocaine and bargain-priced women, and McConaughey (a Texas native) throws himself into this vividly off-color role, body and soul.

Woodroof initially laughs off his 30-day life sentence. Like Denzel Washington's Captain Whitaker in ""Flight,"" he's seemingly unkillable, a party-cockroach immune to all poisons. After several fainting spells, however, he's begging Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) for the then-breakthrough drug AZT. When he learns that other promising drugs are banned in the United States, Woodroof sets about smuggling them in. All he needs are some customers.

Enter Rayon (an excellent Jared Leto), a transgender woman who becomes Woodroof's unlikely business partner. She's a fictional character, a stand-in for an entire class of people that Woodroof initially abhors. What they share is a desire to live, and Rayon, a gay nightlife denizen with a heroin habit, has the better Rolodex. The movie's best moments are shared between these two outsiders, who evolve from antagonists to co-workers to almost-married couple. A scene in which one of Woodroof's good-ol'-buddies catches them bickering in the supermarket is nearly worth the ticket price.

Directed with a bit of flair by Jean-Marc Valée from a well-crafted script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" mostly unfolds as a solid and straightforward biopic, but McConaughey is so fierce and funny that he turns it into something transcendent. When he's on the screen, the movie feels thrillingly alive.



PLOT In 1985, a homophobic Texan with AIDS becomes an unlikely hero for the gay community.

CAST Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, Jennifer Garner

LENGTH 1:57

BOTTOM LINE A solid biopic is made transcendent by McConaughey, who shed nearly 50 pounds and deserves to gain an Oscar for his ferocious, funny performance.

-----



McCONAUGHEY IS WAY MORE THAN ABS

After a string of fluffy rom-coms (""Failure to Launch,"" ""The Wedding Planner"") and mindless actioners (""Reign of Fire,"" ""Sahara""), it was hard to regard Matthew McConaughey as more than prime Texas beef with a well-chiseled six-pack. But over the past two years, he's become a darling of critics, thanks to these complex performances.

KILLER JOE (2011) -- As a Dallas cop who moonlights as a contract killer, McConaughey earns kudos from critics, including Newsday's Rafer Guzmán, who found him ""charming, funny and repellent all at once.""

BERNIE (2012) -- ""The actor wears the role of good ol' boy-political opportunist as comfortably as the boots and Stetson,"" the Los Angeles Times wrote of McConaughey's amusing turn as a showboating Texas DA in this black comedy.

MAGIC MIKE (2012) -- McConaughey steals the show as the slick, fast-talking owner of a club featuring male strippers. He also gets to show off his abs -- and more -- during a striptease to KISS' ""Calling Dr. Love.""

MUD (2012) -- As a Boo Radley-ish loner living on the bayou in this noirish thriller, McConaughey's powerful performance inspired The Washington Post to note ""the boy with the bedroom eyes and bong-hit grin is a real actor, after all.""

NewsDay,NY Knicks' Tyson Chandler Appointed Newest UNICEF Ambassador,"Chandler to light the UNICEF Snowflake this Friday on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue to help raise awareness for children and families in Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan

The U.S. Fund for UNICEF today announced that NY Knicks’ Tyson Chandler is the newest UNICEF Ambassador. Chandler—the first American NBA player to be named a UNICEF Ambassador—will fundraise, educate and advocate on behalf of vulnerable children around the world.

In his first role as UNICEF Ambassador, Chandler will light the UNICEF Snowflake this Friday on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. The lighting ceremony will help raise awareness of areas of the Philippines ravaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan. The latest estimates indicate that as many as four million children could now be affected by the disaster. UNICEF is providing children and families with immediate necessities including food, water, and medicine. Designed by Ingo Maurer and dedicated to UNICEF by The Stonbely Family Foundation in 2002, the Snowflake serves as a beacon of hope and compassion.

Following his gold medal win with the U.S. Olympic Men’s Basketball team at the London Olympics, Chandler travelled to Tanzania with the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. While in Tanzania, Chandler visited UNICEF-supported programs that provide children with life and vocational skills training and health centers for mothers of children with HIV/AIDS.

“Traveling to Africa with UNICEF and seeing kids who don’t have access to an education, or who are living on the streets was a life-changing experience for me,” said Chandler. “I’m incredibly honored to help raise awareness of UNICEF’s work that’s truly making a difference for the lives of children.”

In the U.S., Chandler has served as a strong advocate for the organization, raising awareness of emergency relief efforts and campaigns such as the UNICEF Tap Project to millions of basketball fans. An aspiring photographer, Chandler hosted a photo gallery exhibit in October 2012. Featuring powerful images from his trip to Tanzania, the exhibit generated thousands of dollars for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. Additionally, Chandler donated the exclusive opportunity to spend a day with him during NY Knicks practice as part of the 2012 UNICEF Snowflake Ball live auction.

""Tyson’s deep commitment to saving and improving the lives of children is evident to those around him,” said Caryl Stern, President and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. “We’re excited that he’s using his voice to help shine a light on the issues that children around the world face every day, such as lack of access to clean water or medicine.”

Chandler -- who is in his third season with the Knicks after joining the team in 2011 – has quite a few career accomplishments. In 2012 he was selected for the NBA All-Star team and named the Defensive Player of the Year. In 2011 he helped lead the Dallas Mavericks to their NBA championship. Off the court, Chandler, with his wife Kimberly, is devoted to philanthropic efforts. In addition to their work with UNICEF, they launched ‘Rebound 4 Rockaway’ to help those affected by Superstorm Sandy in Far Rockaway, New York.

Chandler joins a roster of celebrities who have supported UNICEF over the years, from Danny Kaye and Audrey Hepburn, to Laurence Fishburne, Selena Gomez, Angie Harmon, Téa Leoni, Lucy Liu, Alyssa Milano, and Sarah Jessica Parker, among others.

NewsDay,Global Health Corps Calls for Young Professionals to Join the Movement for Health Equity,"Applications for 2014-15 Fellowship Now Open!

Today, Global Health Corps (GHC) opened applications for its sixth class of fellows and urged young professionals who want to make an impact in global health and development to apply for its fellowships in Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and the United States.

GHC is creating a new breed of health sector leaders - a global community of changemakers - that develop innovative solutions to the world’s most challenging health problems. GHC seeks to engage young professionals with skill-sets that are often viewed as outside of the traditional health field, such as financial managers, communications specialists, architects, computer scientists and supply chain analysts. Through the fellowship, these professionals apply their expertise to help address urgent global health challenges by working with Ministries of Health, non-profits and other health organizations. Fellows work on issues such as HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, agriculture and health financing.

“Global Health Corps is proud to recruit its sixth class of outstanding fellows,” said CEO and co-founder Barbara Bush. “The GHC community is comprised of young leaders who share a common belief that health is a human right, and we invite passionate young leaders who are committed to social justice to apply for the fellowship and join the fight for health equity.”

GHC offers young leaders year-long paid fellowships in partnership with internationally renowned organizations, including Partners In Health, Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and USAID, who are working on the frontlines of the fight for global health equity. Each international fellow is paired with a fellow from the host country in which they work to promote cross-cultural knowledge sharing and support. Throughout the fellowship year, GHC provides training in partnership with The Global Health Leadership Institute at Yale University, mentorship, and professional development opportunities to ensure that fellows are equipped to be global health changemakers during the fellowship and beyond.

“What makes this partnership special is that it brings together talented young people and organizations working on the ground to create innovative solutions in global health,” said Adrian Stuart, Country Director of CHAI Malawi. “Our Global Health Corps fellows work seamlessly with the CHAI employees to bring fresh ideas to the table and implement new strategies to ensure that individuals suffering from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis have regular and affordable access to life-saving medicine.""

Since 2009, Global Health Corps has placed 322 fellows to work in non-profit and with government partners focused on healthcare delivery. Our fifth class currently in the field consists of 106 fellows from 16 countries, who work with 44 non-profit and government partners. The fellows are working on a range of projects, including developing electronic medical record systems in Malawi, counseling homeless youth in New Jersey, and constructing a world-class hospital in rural Rwanda. For our 2014-2015 fellowship class, GHC received more than 100 applications from partner organizations, which will allows us to expand our work with a diverse range of partners doing high impact work in global health.

“Global Health Corps is a unique opportunity not available anywhere else,” said Lisa Grossman and Neil Malilwe, 2012-2013 fellows with Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ). “During our fellowship, we worked directly on complex problems like the need to improve women’s health and service delivery, while simultaneously gaining a better and broader perspective on the complex issues of social justice and equity.”

To apply for a 2014-2015 Fellowship, please visit http://ghcorps.org/fellows/apply/. All applicants must be 30 years or younger, have earned an undergraduate university degree by July 2014, and be proficient in English.

Applications close on January 26.

NewsDay,Role model still unique position for UFC's Liz Carmouche,"Losing that fight changed her life. Just not in the way we typically associate with being on the wrong side of victory in sports.

“It went from ‘I was a nobody on the street, just another person,’” said Liz Carmouche about life after losing to star-in-the-making Ronda Rousey in the first UFC women’s bout last February. “It turned into something completely different. People were coming up to me, they knew who I was us, requesting pictures. On Facebook, people [were] telling me the influence and impact I had on their lives.""

For a self-described “recluse,” that’s a tough adjustment. But, it speaks to how relatable Carmouche is to people who aren’t even MMA fans.

""I don't know that I fully can process it,” Carmouche said. “To me, I feel like I play such small role in this life and this world. For me to not really have an opportunity to know the person personally but to still have an impact on the person’s life, to me, that's mind boggling.""

She fits neatly into far more demographic checkboxes than most fighters. She was in the Marine Corps. She served three tours in Iraq. She’s a mixed martial artist. She’s a spokeswoman for the UFC’s new HIV awareness partnership with The Center in Las Vegas. She’s one of the few openly gay athletes in U.S. pro sports.

“I think I'm a different creature from the rest,” said Carmouche, 29. “Growing up, I never thought that I would fall into any category. I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere. So now to kind of be a role model for all these different social groups is a huge change for me, and it's a really humbling change because it was never a place I saw myself being in life.”

Carmouche now defines herself simply – “just me.”

She will be looked at Wednesday night as the No. 4 ranked bantamweight facing No. 6 Alexis Davis at UFC Fight for the Troops in Fort Campbell, Ky.

It’s the third time in the past six years the UFC has promoted such an event. The purpose of the fight card is to help raise money through auctions and donations for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, a non-profit group that aids military personnel who suffered traumatic brain injury during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""Having been in the Marine Corps and seeing the influence the UFC and Strikeforce had on military personnel lives, and when they would do similar events in Iraq and on the bases, it just brought up morale so much,” Carmouche said. “So to be a part of it and know that I’m going to play a role in helping bring up military personnel morale, it's just awesome to be on the reverse side of it now.""

Three other members of the U.S. armed forces, be it veterans or still on active duty, are on the UFC Fight for the Troops card.

Tim Kennedy, an Army Ranger and Green Beret, headlines the night against Rafael Natal. Kennedy (16-4) is coming off wins over Roger Gracie and Trevor Smith.

Colton Smith, a staff sergeant on active duty in the Army and a Season 16 winner of “The Ultimate Fighter,” fights Season 15 winner Michael Chiesa.

Illinois Army National Guard Sgt. Neil Magny fights Seth Baczynski.

Long Island’s Dennis Bermudez also continues his climb up the featherweight division against Steven Siler. That fight airs as part of the prelims on Fox Sports 1 beginning at 5 p.m. ET. The main card airs at 7 p.m.

NewsDay,Ubuntu Africa Launches Global World AIDS Day Campaign for HIV+ Youth in South Africa,"Campaign focuses on ‘ubuntu’, African philosophy of humanity and inter-connectedness.

Ubuntu Africa (UBA) has launched a World AIDS Day campaign called #DoUbuntu, encouraging individuals and businesses to spread the spirit of ‘ubuntu’ to raise funds and awareness for UBA’s work around the world. ‘Ubuntu’ is an African philosophy meaning: “I am human through the humanity of others.”

For the month of November, participants are asked to choose a day as their #DoUbuntu day and, in a creative way, raise $1,000 for UBA. This will contribute to UBA’s goal of raising $30,000 in the 30 days leading up to World AIDS Day on December 1st.

#DoUbuntu global highlights: In Canada, a group of individuals will participate in a scavenger hunt; in Germany an elementary school will hold an African bazaar; in the UK an individual has donated her birthday gifts to UBA; California college students are holding on-campus fundraising competitions; and a South African night club will host a fundraising party. The campaign will culminate on World AIDS Day where UBA children will perform at a concert hall in Khayelitsha. On December 12th, UBA will host a celebratory Rock ‘n Roll concert in New York City.

Founded by Whitney Johnson at the age of 21 after she witnessed devastating impacts of HIV at an orphanage in Khayelitsha, UBA serves more than 200 HIV+ children, and provides them with psychosocial support, health and nutrition, community support and HIV and life skills education.

“Every World AIDS DAY is an opportunity to raise awareness not only of the challenges HIV infected children face, but also, more importantly, to shine a light on the bright futures these amazing children can have when given the right care and support. The #Doubuntu campaign gives us a chance to garner support for the children we serve and share the spirit of Ubuntu on a global scale,” said Johnson.

Join the Campaign: If interested in taking part in the #DoUbuntu campaign, there are still days available. Passionate individuals and businesses welcome! Event URL: http://ubafrica.org/2013/09/doubuntu-world-aids-day-2013/.

NewsDay,HIV Resistance Mapped by Gene Researchers,"Researchers who created the first map of human resistance to HIV say their achievement could lead to improved treatments for the virus, which causes AIDS.

When a person is infected with HIV, the immune system tries to destroy the virus. In order to thwart those attacks, HIV undergoes millions of genetic mutations a day. In most cases, this tactic enables HIV to defeat the immune system.

However, some people's immune systems manage to hold HIV at bay without any treatment.

""The virus survives but replicates more slowly, and thus its capacity for destruction is in some sense neutralized,"" study co-author Jacques Fellay, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, said in an institute news release.

In this study, Fellay and fellow geneticists used a supercomputer to analyze immune system-triggered mutations in the genomes of a variety of strains of HIV from more than 1,000 patients.

The findings improve understanding of how the immune system tries to defend against HIV and how HIV adapts to that defense, according to the study published Oct. 29 in the journal eLife.

By studying people's natural defenses against HIV, it may be possible to develop new treatments and individualized therapies that take into account patients' genetic strengths and weaknesses, the researchers suggested.

NewsDay,"Early HIV Treatment a Win-Win, Researchers Report","Providing early antiretroviral drug treatment for recently infected HIV patients and their uninfected sexual partners is a cost-effective way to help patients stay healthy and prevent transmission of HIV, a new study finds.

The study, published Oct. 31 in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at HIV patients in India and South Africa. Some of the patients received early antiretroviral therapy while the start of treatment was delayed for other patients. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.

During the first five years of the study, 93 percent of those who received early antiretroviral therapy survived, compared with 83 percent of those whose treatment was delayed. Life expectancy was nearly 16 years for those in the early treatment group, compared with nearly 14 years for those in the delayed treatment group.

During the first five years, the potential costs of infections -- particularly tuberculosis -- prevented by early treatment of HIV patients in South Africa outweighed the costs of antiretroviral therapy drugs, suggesting that the early treatment strategy would reduce overall costs.

This was not the case in India, where the costs of treating HIV-related infections are less. Even so, early antiretroviral therapy in India was projected to be cost-effective according to established standards, the researchers said.

They also found that across patients' lifetimes, early antiretroviral therapy was very cost-effective in both countries. While most of the benefits of early treatment were seen in the HIV-infected patients -- fewer illnesses and deaths -- there were also added health care and economic cost savings from reducing HIV transmission, according to the study.

""By demonstrating that early HIV therapy not only has long-term clinical benefits to individuals but also provides excellent economic value in both low- and middle-income countries, this study provides a critical answer to an urgent policy question,"" study corresponding author Dr. Rochelle Walensky, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Division of Infectious Disease, said in a hospital news release.

""HIV-infected patients live healthier lives, their partners are protected from HIV, and the investment is superb,"" she added.

Walensky, a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the findings point to a need to ""redouble international efforts"" to provide early antiretroviral therapy to any HIV-infected person who can benefit from it.

Her colleague, Dr. Kenneth Freedberg, director of the Medical Practice Evaluation Center at Massachusetts General, agreed.

""Some people have questioned whether providing early [antiretroviral therapy] to all who need it would be feasible in resource-limited countries,"" he said in the news release. ""We've shown that in countries like South Africa, where it actually saves money in the short-term, the answer is 'yes.' We believe that continued international public and private partnerships can make this true in other countries as well.""

Freedberg said such an investment could bring about dramatic decreases in infections and illness that could save millions of lives over the next decade.

NewsDay,Key Safety Questions May Linger for FDA-Expedited Drugs,"When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration whisks new drugs to market, they do get to patients faster. But they are often not tested as strictly as treatments that get standard reviews, a new study shows.

The research suggests that speed may come at the expense of safety when it comes to testing new medications.

The study, which was published online Oct. 28 in JAMA Internal Medicine, tracked the fates of the 20 new drugs approved by the FDA in 2008.

Eight of the drugs were granted some kind of expedited review. Under expedited reviews, the FDA can waive some of its own rules if regulators decide that new drugs represent key treatment advances or fill unmet needs.

Drugs that were hurried through included treatments for cancer, HIV, pain, abnormal bleeding and a rare disease.

On average, researchers found that expedited drugs made it to market in just over five years. That's about two and a half years sooner than drugs under standard review.

""Development time and approval of new drugs is really quite rapid, especially for the novel drugs, but a large number of safety questions remain unanswered,"" said lead researcher Thomas Moore. He is a senior scientist at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit patient safety group in Horsham, Pa.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The expedited drugs were tested in an average of 104 patients, while drugs that got routine reviews were tested in an average of 580 patients, the study authors noted.

""I was surprised by how limited some of the testing was,"" Moore said.

The FDA also ordered more additional studies for fast-tracked treatments than they did for treatments getting standard reviews.

Post-marketing studies are typically required by regulators to address lingering safety questions.

""There were enough unanswered questions that they required 85 post-market studies,"" Moore said. ""We're deferring a lot of our testing until after approval,"" he added.

The agency ordered 48 post-marketing studies for the eight expedited drugs compared with 37 for the 12 medications that got standard reviews.

Some of those studies may still be ongoing. The study authors couldn't find any information on testing timelines for six of the drugs reviewed in 2008. But of the 48 additional studies that were due to be completed by 2013, researchers found that 14 had not been completed or submitted for review on time.

Four years after approval, the study found that many of the drugs had newly discovered safety issues. Five drugs got new or expanded boxed warnings, the most serious kind of caution, added to their labels. Four drugs had additional warnings or precautions added to their packaging.

Moore said he expects that won't be the end of it. On average, he said, previous studies have shown that it takes about 11 years for the FDA to act on safety issues.

In response, the FDA said the study shows that its expedited drug development programs are working as they are supposed to.

""In situations of serious and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical need, patients and physicians who treat them have told us repeatedly that they are willing to accept greater uncertainty about risk in order to have access to the hope of improved treatment today,"" the FDA said in a written statement. ""We believe that we have set the bar for the balance between pre-approval testing and early availability of promising new drugs to treat serious and life-threatening diseases in the right place.""

But Moore isn't so sure.

""I think that having poorly tested drugs that we don't know enough about is of very limited benefit to anybody,"" he said.

NewsDay,LI women help themselves by helping others,"When Lori Schonfeld retired in 2004, she worried that she would lose her identity and become a ""nonperson."" ""I didn't know what I would do with myself,"" the Island Park resident recalled.

Determined to stay active, Schonfeld, who is in her 70s and retired from a career in property management, joined a handful of community-service, recreational and social organizations in search of meaningful activities and friendship. One group stood out: a Long Island nonprofit now known as the Meadowbrook Women's Initiative (MWI). ""I bonded with the women, and all the activities are during the day, so my days are full,"" she said.

Celebrating its fifth year under its current name, MWI is a 550-member organization of women with a threefold mission — education, community service and philanthropy. Its members meet those objectives with a calendar of study groups, a plethora of volunteer activities and financial donations to local nonprofit service agencies. In return, members say MWI imbues their lives with purpose and friends. ""It's a community,"" said the group's president, Barbara Goldstein, 70, a member since 2005, who lives in Plainview.

Breaking with Brandeis

MWI (meadowbrookwomen.org.) began in 1958 as the Meadowbrook Chapter of Brandeis University National Women's Committee. The name was inspired by the large percentage of members living in communities along the state parkway in Nassau County.

But dissatisfaction with the university's policies regarding everything from fundraising to membership and a growing desire to support local nonprofit institutions, drove members to step away from Brandeis and recast their group as the Meadowbrook Women's Initiative, according to board member Linda Susman, 70, of Merrick. Their emphasis turned to helping others on Long Island ""where most of us raised our families, where we have chosen to spend our retirement and where there are so many worthwhile charities,"" Susman explained.

Best Bets Get the scoop on events, nightlife, day trips, family fun and things to do on Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

MWI is open to all women. Members range in age from the mid-60s to their 90s. Many worked in marketing, advertising, real estate, education or retail before retiring. With guidance from an attorney, members segued from Brandeis to Meadowbrook while continuing the efforts that first attracted them to the Brandeis committee.

Annual membership dues are $65, and several fundraisers are held each year, including a book-and-author luncheon in the spring and a fall gala. This year's gala, held Oct. 15 at the Crest Hollow Country Club, was themed ""Hooray for Hollywood"" and proved so popular that attendance had to be capped at 300, according to Schonfeld, who served as the event chair. The dues and monies they raise go toward the group's annual philanthropic objectives. MWI allots 60 percent of its charitable dollars to different Long Island charities every year.

$45,000 to charities

June Stelboum, the group's vice president of philanthropy, heads a five-person committee responsible for selecting the charities. This year, MWI gave away $45,000, a 20 percent increase over last yer. Grants supported Angela's House in Smithtown and Family Residence and Essential Enterprise (FREE), in Hauppauge. Last year, the Head Injury Association in Hauppauge and the Long Island Crisis Center in Bellmore were recipients.

""MWI has our total admiration,"" said Fran Karliner, development director at the Crisis Center, which received $10,800. ""They want to give back to the community, and they do it in such a generous and caring way."" In light of government cutbacks, Karliner said MWI's gift helped in sustaining the crisis center's community education program for middle and high school students that addresses ""suicide prevention and awareness and other self-injurious behaviors, such as anger management and cyberbullying.""

Stelboum, a 70-something resident of Middle Island, said the group learns about worthy organizations from its members and newspaper articles. The committee researches the nonprofits' websites, interviews key personnel, reads the charity's literature and reviews its tax returns.

Every year, MWI uses 40 percent of its charitable dollars for stipends to Hofstra Medical School students volunteering in summer internships. Collin Fuller, 26, was one of six Hofstra medical students who received MWI stipends, which ranged from $2,500 to $5,000 this year. During the summer break, Fuller spent two weeks in the Dominican Republic researching neonatal care on a sugar plantation, with the help of an interpreter.

""It was an amazing experience, and I want to go back and serve the community in the future,"" said the Minnesota native and New York University graduate. ""The people were so generous of their time, opening up to us so that future generations on plantations will have better health care."" Fuller, a second-year medical student, said he is indebted to MWI for its $2,500 stipend, which covered his airline travel and living expenses. ""It was pretty expensive, and I wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for their support,"" he said.

Earlier this year, MWI also gave a $1,500 grant to Advancing Women in Science and Medicine, an arm of the Feinstein Institution for Medical Research at North Shore/LIJ Medical Center.

Members also perform community service in a wide-range of volunteer efforts, including staffing a sundries shop and running monthly Bingo games at A. Holly Patterson Extended Care Facility in Uniondale; and helping at the Kiwanis gift-wrap kiosk at the Roosevelt Field mall. The women also craft Ouch Babies — dolls that enable children in hospitals to indicate where they feel pain and that help doctors explain a procedure to them.

With donations from members and stores, the group provides school supplies to abused and neglected kids living in a Long Island safe house and the children of parents who have cancer. Members also knit hats and scarves and buy gloves for these children.

Using her knitting and crocheting skills, Bea Wolf, 83, makes hats and scarves for children, as well as afghans for hospitalized veterans, children and AIDS-HIV patients. But, as she tells it, MWI's knitwear efforts take teamwork. Her husband drives her to various locations to deliver the finished goods, and she has marshaled 20 women, who don't belong to MWI, to help with the handiwork. ""It keeps me active and going,"" said Wolf, who also lives in East Meadow.

Gloria Cohen's East Meadow home serves as a drop-off site for donations of clothes and other items from club members. ""The more we do, the more we see there's a need, and we keep doing,"" said Cohen, 77, MWI's vice president of community service.

The group also runs programs tailored to its members. Elaine Myers, 77, is vice president of ""singles."" She organizes buffet luncheons and other outings, such as theatrical performances, on Sunday afternoons — when single women are likely to find themselves alone. The gatherings typically attract 45 to 60 attendees.

A supportive group

""It's not a support group where you sit and tell your problems, but it's a supportive group,"" said Myers, a Plainview resident who has been a widow for 22 years. She joined the organization after retiring eight years ago as an administrator and teacher at a private high school.

Members say MWI enriches their lives with study groups, classes in beginner bridge, drama and the Holocaust. Costs are kept down by holding these sessions in places that provide free space, such as libraries and synagogues, and mostly relying on members to run them.

Members say the classes have helped them to explore new interests. Cohen said she discovered a new talent when she joined a study group three years ago. ""For the first time in my life,"" she said, ""I took up creative writing and didn't know I could write — and I like it.""",24/10/2013
NewsDay,Counseling With HIV Testing May Not Help Prevent Future STDs,"Contrary to what experts have believed, briefly counseling people who take a rapid HIV test on how to reduce their risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is not effective, a new study shows.

Counseling for these at-risk patients did not reduce the incidence of STDs up to six months after patients were tested for HIV, the study found. A more focused approach to providing information at the time of testing may be needed, the authors said, since counseling requires valuable resources of time, money and personnel.

""Overall, these study findings lend support for reconsidering the role of counseling as an essential adjunct to HIV testing,"" study author Lisa Metsch, at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and colleagues wrote in the Oct. 23 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""This inference is further buttressed by the additional costs associated with counseling at the time of testing: Without evidence of effectiveness, counseling cannot be considered an efficient use of resources,"" they added.

In the United States alone, about 50,000 new HIV infections occur every year, according to a journal news release. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended that all people aged between 15 and 65 be screened for HIV (which causes AIDS).

The researchers randomly assigned about 5,000 patients treated at nine STI clinics in the United States to receive either brief patient-centered HIV risk-reduction counseling along with a rapid HIV test, or the rapid HIV test with information only and no risk-reduction counseling.

Patients who were counseled received advice on their specific high-risk behaviors and concrete steps they could take to reduce their risk for STDs. The researchers assessed STDs among the patients when the study began and again six months after they had their HIV test.

Both men and women were tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, genital herpes and HIV, along with Trichomonas testing for women.

During the study, the STD incidence was 12.3 percent in the counseling group and 11.1 percent in the information-only group. The researchers noted that their findings were consistent at all nine STI clinics and after taking into account the patients' age, sex, race and ethnicity.

However, counseling is vital for patients who are indeed found to have HIV, the researchers emphasized.

""Post-test counseling for persons testing HIV-positive remains essential, both for addressing psychological needs and for providing and ensuring follow-through with medical care and support,"" they wrote. ""A more focused approach to providing information at the time of testing may allow clinics to use resources more efficiently to conduct universal testing, potentially detecting more HIV cases earlier and linking and engaging HIV-infected people in care.""

NewsDay,Scientists Uncover Breast Milk's Potential Secret Weapon Against HIV,"Experts have long suspected that breast milk may have the power to prevent babies from getting infected with HIV, and new research gives insight into why that might be so.

Researchers say they've discovered a component of breast milk that appears to kill the virus that causes AIDS, potentially preventing some babies from becoming infected by their mothers.

""Even though we have anti-retroviral drugs that can work to prevent mother-to-child transmission, not every pregnant woman is being tested for HIV, and less than 60 percent are receiving the prevention drugs -- particularly in countries with few resources,"" study senior author Dr. Sallie Permar, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Duke University, said in a university statement. ""There is still a need for alternative strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission, which is why this work is important.""

According to UNICEF, an estimated 330,000 children worldwide in 2011 became infected by their mothers during pregnancy or birth.

The protein the researchers pinpointed, known as Tenascin-C or TNC, wasn't previously suspected to have germ-fighting abilities. The researchers reached their conclusions after testing samples of breast milk from uninfected women to see if it could combat HIV strains.

""TNC is a component of the 'extracellular matrix' that is integral to how tissues hold themselves together,"" Permar said. ""This is a protein involved during wound healing, playing a role in tissue repair. It is also known to be important in fetal development, but its reason for being a component of breast milk or its antiviral properties had never been described.""

Future research should examine whether the protein works with other components of breast milk to fight HIV, she said.

Dr. Barton Haynes, director of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, added: ""The discovery of the HIV-inhibiting effect of this common protein in breast milk provides a potential explanation for why nursing infants born to HIV-infected mothers do not become infected more often than they do.""

""It also provides support for inducing inhibitory factors in breast milk that might be even more protective, such as antibodies, that would completely protect babies from HIV infection in this setting,"" Haynes said.

The study was published Oct. 17 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The LAMP (Learning About Multimedia Project ) a non-profit organization educating and equipping people to shape the media landscape through hands-on training, today announces the official launch of Media Breaker at New York University’s Engelberg Center on Innovation Law & Policy on Tuesday, October 29 from 4:00 to 8:00 pm. The event is free and open to the public but registration is required; click here to register to attend. Media Breaker is a free online video editor for remixing third-party content such as news clips, commercials and music videos in an educational setting.

“The media hold prime real estate in the lives of our youth, and they need to be held accountable for their messages,” said D.C. Vito, Executive Director of The LAMP. “The Media Breaker empowers young people to talk back to stereotypes and challenge mass media messages. Plus, its cloud-based platform and simple design make it a viable option for teachers who want to meet students where they are, and use popular media as a gateway for critical thinking and new literacies.”

The launch event, called Taking on the Take-Down Notice: Copyright, Youth and Educators in Harmony, will include a discussion moderated by NYU Law Professor Christopher Sprigman with New York City students about how fair use laws have impacted their education. The event will also include a demonstration of the Media Breaker tool, and a panel with leading experts in the fields of intellectual property law, education and digital rights. The panel will include:



Christopher Bavitz, Managing Director, Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic based at the Berkman Center;

Jeanne Fromer, Professor of Law at NYU School of Law focusing on copyright, intellectual property and patent law;

Elisa Kreisinger, Digital Artist, Fair Use Rights Activist and Artist-in-Residence at Eyebeam Art+Technology Center;

Jill Lesser, Executive Director, Center for Copyright Information; and

Gigi Sohn, President and CEO of digital rights advocacy group Public Knowledge.

The expert panel will be moderated by The LAMP’s co-founder, Dr. Katherine Fry, and will tackle challenging questions around how media can–and must–be part of the future of education. They will also call attention to the lack of awareness among educators and students about their rights under fair use, which allows the reuse and modification of copyrighted materials.

The launch of Media Breaker is intended to amplify The LAMP’s programming throughout New York City, teach youth, parents and educators how to have a healthy and critical relationship with all forms of media. As New York City’s only nonprofit transporting equipment and facilitators directly to communities in need of its services, The LAMP has brought media literacy training to over 2,500 youth, parents and educators. Media Breaker enables The LAMP to take its programming online, and to reach students nationwide. Teachers are witnessing engaged and energized students, who are enjoying learning as never before.

NewsDay,Meds That Prevent HIV Infection Don't Spur Risky Behavior: Study,"HIV-negative heterosexuals who take drugs that protect them from contracting the AIDS virus from their HIV-positive partners don't engage in more risky sexual behaviors, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle found that knowing they are protected against HIV transmission doesn't change how these people behave sexually or lead them to have sex without a condom more often.

The study is published in the Oct. 16 issue of the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

""Evidence for the effectiveness of new HIV-prevention strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, has spurred optimism that the global HIV epidemic might be reversed,"" Dr. Jared Baeten said in a journal news release. ""However, an important question is whether HIV-negative partners who know they're protected by prophylaxis will compensate for this by increasing their sexual risk-taking, such as through increasing their levels of unprotected sex.""

In conducting the study, an international team of researchers led by Baeten examined findings from the 2011 Partners PrEP study, which revealed that a preventive drug regimen could protect HIV-negative men and women from contracting the virus from their HIV-positive partner.

The researchers examined information on more than 3,000 people for up to one year before and after taking drugs to prevent the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The participants were counseled on pregnancy testing and how to reduce their risk for sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis.

Even before the participants learned the results of the research, which established the protective effects of the drugs, they were engaging in unprotected sex less often, the study authors found. The researchers concluded that the risk counseling the participants had received may have been effective.

After the participants knew the drugs they were taking were shown to provide protection against HIV transmission, the investigators found no significant difference in the level of unprotected sex taking place between partners.

There was, however, a slight increase in the frequency of unprotected sex outside the relationship. The researchers said there was no increase in rates of sexually transmitted infections or pregnancy.

""The results provide encouraging evidence that behavioral changes as a result of pre-exposure prophylaxis might not undermine its strong HIV prevention and public-health benefits,"" Baeten said.

NewsDay,"Crystal Meth May Jump-Start Injection Drug Use, Study Says","Young people who use crystal methamphetamine are at increased risk of injecting drugs, a new Canadian study finds.

The highly addictive man-made stimulant is usually smoked but sometimes snorted or injected for its euphoric effects.

Researchers looked at 395 street youth, ages 14 to 26, in Vancouver, who used crystal meth but were not injection drug users. During a follow-up of about five years, 64 (16 percent) of these young people injected drugs for the first time. Crystal meth was the drug most commonly used in the first injection.

First-time drug injection took place in a variety of locations -- with 39 percent occurring in public places -- and usually with other people present, including friends (57 percent), family members (13 percent) and acquaintances (10 percent), according to the study published Oct. 15 in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).

Among those who began injecting drugs during the study period, the average age when they started using crystal meth was 14, the study authors noted in a journal news release.

""Addressing the impact of crystal methamphetamine use in increasing the risk of injection initiation among injection-naive street-involved youth represents an urgent public health priority,"" wrote study co-author Dr. Evan Wood from the B.C. Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, at the University of British Columbia, and colleagues there and at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control.

The investigators called for further research to develop evidence-based methods to prevent drug injection that take into account the complexities of using crystal methamphetamine with other drugs.

NewsDay,Rules for taking medication vacations,"There's sometimes a temptation to stop taking a medication, especially if you are either having side-effects or are feeling better. But Long Island experts say few patients should ever stop their regimen without a doctor's permission.

""If patients stop their medications without supervision, conditions could worsen and become very dangerous,"" said Dr. Susan Hirsch, an internist who's affiliated with North Shore University Hospital and sees patients in Great Neck. People with heart issues, including those who take high blood pressure drugs, face an especially high level of risk if they stop drugs such as clonidine (Catapres) or beta-blockers, she said.

RISKING ILLNESS

Another group of medication-takers -- those with anxiety, depression or both -- should be especially cautious about stopping medications known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a class of antidepressants), including such well-known drugs as Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Celexa. ""Stopping SSRIs abruptly can cause severe withdrawal symptoms such as flu-like illness, lightheadedness or electric sensations in the back of the head,"" Hirsch said.

People who take these drugs should taper off their usage slowly and never take a ""drug holiday,"" she noted.

Stopping medications can also be especially dangerous for people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, because breaks can cause the virus to gain strength. And people who take antibiotics must not take a break without a physician's recommendation because dormant germs can return and become strong, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre.

BREAKS THAT MIGHT GET THE DOCTOR'S OK

However, physicians may advise a medication ""vacation"" in certain circumstances:

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Doctors may recommend temporarily stopping certain drugs -- like blood thinners -- before surgery.

A doctor may stop a statin drug used to treat high cholesterol and check levels in a few months to see if it's necessary to restart it, Hirsch said.

Physicians may recommend a permanent break from Fosamax, a drug used to treat osteoporosis, and similar medications after someone has taken it for five years. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the drugs don't seem to have benefits after that length of time.

Cancer patients may also take medication vacations in some circumstances. Glatt said that physicians might stop the drugs for a few weeks so patients can become healthy enough to tolerate them.

What if a drug costs too much? Some people may feel tempted to save money by not taking their prescription or over-the-counter drugs as directed, considering that some medications cost hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. But that's a bad idea, Hirsch said, especially because there are things patients can do to lower costs.

""Always ask your doctor about the cheapest alternatives and generics,"" she said, and be open about cost being an issue. ""Sometimes, the doctor is not aware there is a problem with affordability or assumes insurance will cover it.""

It's also important to keep in mind that going off medication could worsen a medical condition like high blood pressure, she said, and lead to more costs in the long run.",15/10/2013
NewsDay,HOW COME? Even bugs need their share of shut-eye,"Do bugs sleep like other animals? asks a reader.So far, scientists have found that bees, fruit flies, cockroaches, moths, paper wasps, locusts and scorpions all enjoy (and require) a good snooze.

Of the known bug sleepers, it's honeybees and fruit flies that have been studied the most. Scientists say honeybees make good subjects because hive living makes them so social, and because their elaborate social life has been studied for so long.

Like us humans, bees tend to sleep mostly at night, antennae relaxed and slumping. Bees also squeeze in naps during the morning or afternoon. During a bee's long sleeps, researchers have observed short bursts of movement in the antennae, rather like a person's ""rapid eye movements."" This may indicate that bee sleep involves distinct phases, including dreaming. And just like sleep-deprived people, bees kept up one night tend to sleep more the next.

Scientists say that while we sleep, the brain does its daily cleaning and organizing, erasing nonessential memories and consolidating and storing others. Something similar seems to happen in the nervous systems of sleeping bugs. In 2012, a study in Germany used radio frequency identification devices to track honeybees as they flew. To see how sleep deprivation affects honeybee memory, researchers set up a hive and a movable feeding station. Then they trained groups of bees to fly to the feeder and return to the hive.

After the route had been committed to bee memory, the scientists collected bees busy at the feeder -- and released them at a brand-new location. Which left the bees wondering: Which way was home? By their second try, the bees had memorized the new route. And if the bees had been sleep-deprived before their first trip to the undisclosed location, they still managed to find their way back to the hive.

Then researchers conducted a new experiment. A group of bees was similarly released in the unfamiliar location, and, like the first group, tried to find their way home. But there was a twist: Later that night, scientists kept the bees from sleeping, shaking them awake every few minutes.

The next day, when the bees were once again removed from the feeder and released in the unfamiliar area, their new-route memories proved fragile. Unlike the well-rested first group, which easily found their way home on the second day, only half of the sleep-deprived bees made it back to the hive. And those that did also took twice as long to get there as bees had in the well-rested group.

Unlike the bees that had slept deeply between their first and second tries at the new route, the sleep-deprived group had not consolidated the fledgling memory of the flight path. Likewise, a recent study found that students who slept just after studying were better at remembering the new material the next day.",06/10/2013

NewsDay,"Egg Allergy No Obstacle to Child's Flu Shot, CDC Says","The latest research shows that it's safe for children with an egg allergy to get flu shots without special precautions, according to an update on the issue.

The current recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is to observe children who have an egg allergy for 30 minutes after a flu shot.

It also advises that the shot should be given under the care of a primary care doctor if a child's reaction to eggs is only hives, and under the supervision of an allergist if a child's reaction to eggs is more serious.

However, the new update -- published in the October issue of the journal Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology -- states that such special precautions are not necessary.

""In a large number of research studies published over the last several years, thousands of egg allergic children, including those with a severe life-threatening reaction to eating eggs, have received injectable influenza vaccine (IIV) as a single dose without a reaction,"" allergist Dr. John Kelso said in a news release from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.

""The benefits of the flu vaccination far outweigh any risk,"" he said. ""As with any vaccine, all personnel and facilities administering flu shots should have procedures in place for the rare instance of anaphylaxis, a severe life-threatening allergic reaction. If you have questions or concerns, contact your allergist.""

Flu leads to the hospitalization of more than 21,100 children under the age of 5 in the United States each year, yet only two-thirds of children are vaccinated against flu annually, the news release says.

Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in children, but about 70 percent of those with the allergy outgrow it by age 16. Most allergic reactions to egg involve the skin.

The update is endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.

NewsDay,"AIDS Virus in Cats Might Help Human Vaccine Effort, Study Hints","Cats may hold a key to developing an HIV vaccine for people, a new study suggests.

Researchers found that a protein from the virus that causes AIDS in cats triggered an immune response in blood from HIV-infected people. The virus that causes AIDS in people is called the human immunodeficiency virus while the one that affects cats is called the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

The findings, reported in the October issue of the Journal of Virology suggest that further research with FIV could lead to an HIV vaccine for people, the University of Florida and University of California, San Francisco investigators said.

""One major reason why there has been no successful HIV vaccine to date is that we do not know which parts of HIV to combine to produce the most effective vaccine,"" study corresponding author Janet Yamamoto, a professor of retroviral immunology at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine, said in a university news release.

In previous studies, scientists have combined various whole HIV proteins as vaccine ingredients, but none worked well enough to be used as a commercial vaccine, she explained.

""Surprisingly, we have found that certain peptides of the feline AIDS virus can work exceptionally well at producing human T-cells that fight against HIV,"" Yamamoto said. T-cells are immune system cells that attack cells infected with viruses.

The FIV protein that triggered the human T-cell response is present in multiple HIV-like viruses in different animal species, she said. By studying FIV, the researchers believe that it may be possible to identify regions of HIV that might prove useful targets for a vaccine.

One researcher emphasized that different viruses affect people and cats.

""We want to stress that our findings do not mean that the feline AIDS virus infects humans, but rather that the cat virus resembles the human virus sufficiently so that this cross-reaction can be observed,"" study co-author Dr. Jay Levy, a professor of medicine at UCSF, said in the news release.

NewsDay,Sony engineer 'brain drain' threatens revival,"To hear Yoshinori Onoue tell it, designing the perfect TV requires more than just engineering acumen. It also takes the eye of an artist.

“There’s a canvas on which you paint the picture, and that’s the panel. It has to be absolutely clean,” the veteran Sony Corp. engineer explained. “Then you apply the colors,” he said, describing the three years it took to fine tune contrast and crispness. “There’s no equation for it.”

When Onoue and his handpicked team of engineers -- many old Sony hands, too -- had it just right, he ditched the old set in his bedroom for one of their newest creations. HiVi, Japan’s version of Consumer Reports, this summer rated the bellwether 32-inch model best for picture quality.

A victory for Sony engineering. Not for Sony. The logo on the box belongs to Onoue’s new employer: LG Electronics Inc. The former head of Sony’s display business is among hundreds of engineers behind hit products who’ve left amid a decade of cost cuts that soured a once-celebrated culture of risk-taking. Hemmed in by a fourth and record annual loss of $4.6 billion, one of Kazuo Hirai’s first acts as new president last year was to put 10,000 more jobs on the block, bringing losses to almost 60,000 since 2003.

“They’re pushing out engineers like some kind of bargain sale,” said Onoue. “It’s a huge mistake. You need good people to make good products.”

Brain Drain

The brain drain threatens Hirai’s mission to resuscitate the iconic brand that gave us compact discs, Trinitron color TVs and the Walkman, Sony’s game-changing 1979 portable music player. It’s also given a leg-up to rivals such as LG, its South Korean big brother, Samsung Electronics Co., and Taipei-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.

“There’s nobody in top management who understands how damaging the technology drain is,” said Yasunori Tateishi, whose 2011 book “Goodbye Our Sony” was his ninth charting the company’s 15-year course from Asia’s most-valuable maker of consumer gadgets to an also-ran with a price tag one-10th that of Samsung’s. “Where do these people go after they leave?”

For Sony’s part, the company views its engineers as its most important management asset and is strengthening measures to retain talent in areas crucial to its business strategies, said Mami Imada, a Tokyo-based Sony spokeswoman.

“Under the leadership of many senior executives with engineering backgrounds, Sony is strengthening research and development that can lead to new businesses, speed up innovation and establish core next-generation technologies,” she said.

Chased Out

Because Japan’s labor laws and customs restrict the firing of workers, companies that want to trim payrolls offer packages to flush out volunteers -- effectively giving the most skilled (and frustrated) a cash incentive to jump ship. Unwanted workers who choose to stay are often consigned to oidashibeya, or chase-out rooms, where they’re given menial tasks or asked to do nothing at all in a bid to bore them into quitting.

Hirai raised the pressure in April, introducing automatic demotions for most managers when they reach their 50s. Sony spokeswoman Imada says the policy was designed to get new blood into decision-making roles. Critics say it’s another strategy to shame older, higher-paid workers into leaving.

As Sony’s head of manufacturing strategy in 2009, Onoue quit when he was ordered to come up with a plan for shuttering factories. His three decades of experience were just waiting to be tapped when LG wanted a third crack at Japan’s $2.9 billion TV market. They’d pulled out twice before because the quality of their products failed to meet Japanese standards.

Doing It Right

“They couldn’t just bring over the stuff they were manufacturing in Korea,” said Onoue, 62, now president of LG Electronics Japan Lab, the research unit he started for the Seoul-based company in 2010. “They wanted to do it right this time, and spend the money and hire the people.”

More than 100 Japanese engineers now work at the lab’s sleek, glass offices in Tokyo’s Shinagawa district, a few metro stops from Sony’s headquarters. Onoue, tieless, in a dark, pin-striped suit, says he’s still looking for talent as Japan’s electronics industry retrenches. It’s not just Sony; Panasonic Corp., Sharp Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. are among manufacturers that have cut tens of thousands of jobs in the past year.

LG isn’t alone when it comes to hiring Sony workers. Defections to Samsung began as far back as 2000 with Masaki Oguro, one of the engineers behind Sony’s revolutionary 1995 digital camcorder.

Masaaki Tsuruta, former chief technology officer for the games business, this year became head of Samsung’s Japan operations. Another Sony engineer, Masaharu Tokuhara, overhauled the image-processors -- the brains -- in the Korean company’s TVs.

Old Mojo

Don’t write off Sony just yet, cautions Damian Thong, a Tokyo-based analyst at Macquarie Securities Ltd. A slate of critically acclaimed smartphones and cameras, and the buzz surrounding the planned November release of its first new games console in eight years, are signs the company hasn’t entirely lost its old mojo.

“If Sony really had no people with talent left then I can’t see how they produce things like the RX100, which is the best compact camera in the market,” said Thong, who recommends investors buy the stock. “It’s not just me, it’s every reviewer.”

Changing Tone

Sony’s movie, music and insurance divisions are pulling their weight, and Hirai is playing twin global trends of aging and rising health spending by teaming up with Olympus Corp. to push into medical devices. Sony forecasts $500 million in net income this year, after one-time gains that included the sale of its New York HQ helped it post a first profit in five years in the 12 months through March.

There are early signs, too, that Hirai is changing the tone. He boosted the R&D budget 9 percent last year, as well as visiting Sony offices, factories and labs in 16 countries since taking over from Howard Stringer. Unlike Stringer, Hirai has a good feel for gadgets, according to former Vice Chairman Minoru Morio.

“Hirai asks lots of questions,” said Morio, 72. “He’s totally different from his predecessors, who’d breeze through and just say, ‘Keep up the good work.’”

Still, the 52-year-old, who studied sociology at college and came up through Sony’s music arm, will have trouble reviving the electronics division. The TV unit alone has lost almost $8 billion in the past nine years, and the company never quite figured out how to marry its library of movies and music to hardware.

Fresh Lineup

Sony’s Xperia smartphones were launched to critical acclaim -- into a market already saturated at the top end. Engadget, an online reviewer, last month lauded the Ultra model as “the best phone you’ll probably never buy.” PlayStation4 comes as gamers migrate to mobile and desktop computers. While Sony’s biggest electronics money-maker, CMOS sensors that act as digital eyes in smartphones and cameras made by Apple Inc. and Samsung, is the fruit of decades of research.

“They’re reaping the harvest of work that was started a long time ago,” said Tateishi, the author. “Sony isn’t inventing anything anymore. That’s their biggest problem.”

In the winter of 2000, when Sony refugee Oguro arrived at the camcorder factory in Suwon, Samsung’s base about an hour’s drive outside Seoul, the South Korean company bore little resemblance to the one now dominating global production of smartphones, TVs and semiconductors. Its video cameras were “not saleable products,” according to a secret Sony report that Oguro said turned up mysteriously at his office.

Dusty Monitors

Small wonder. Workers didn’t wear gloves or hair nets. Components sat around in trays so long they’d gather cobwebs. Oguro says he led his boss, who like other Samsung executives never visited the factory floor, to the quality-assurance room where he traced letters in the dust on monitors used to check picture quality to show how dirty they were.

Then he started the cleanup. When the next pilfered Sony report arrived a year later, it said: “Major strides in quality. Reason unknown.”

“It was me,” said Oguro. He followed this by designing the Miniket, a camcorder the size of a cigarette pack that landed Samsung on the cover of BusinessWeek in 2004. “The Korean company makes some of the coolest gadgets on earth,” the magazine said. “Now it’s reinventing itself to get even cooler.” It took Sony three years to catch up.

New Mission

Oguro said an executive’s title, almost double his salary, and a chauffeured car didn’t win him over to Samsung as much as the freedom to innovate -- something that was already slipping away at Sony in 2000. “They wanted me to raise the quality of their video cameras, and they said ’how you do it is up to you,’” he said. “I had a mission again.”

Sony sprouted from the post-war rubble of Japan, an embodiment of the country’s recovery and rise as an economic power. The company was founded by two men who formed a remarkable business partnership: Masaru Ibuka was the restless inventor who pushed engineers to new heights; Akio Morita supplied the vision of what consumers wanted -- sometimes before they knew it themselves.

Sony’s “Founding Prospectus,” handwritten by Ibuka in 1946, described “a stable workplace where engineers could work to their hearts’ content in full consciousness of their joy in technology.”

They scored an impressive list of firsts: Japan’s first tape recorder and transistor radio, the world’s first portable TVs and video-tape recorders. By 1998, the Sony brand overtook Coca-Cola as the best-known and most esteemed by American consumers, according to a Harris poll.

Toy Chest

The Sony spirit was going strong when Susumu Kusakabe, a prodigy who invented a machine for copying floppy disks in bulk while still in college, was recruited in 1981. The Sony lab in Tokyo where he worked had a parts shelf that covered an entire wall, with thousands of drawers full of chips and components -- the ultimate Lego set for inventors. Tinkering was encouraged.

It was an engineer playing around at the parts shelf who came up with the Walkman, Sony’s best-known hit, he said.

By the time Kusakabe left in 2005, the bean counters had the keys to the toy chest. Engineers wanting access had to fill out forms and wait for approval -- often denied, he said.

First To Go

After he was asked to explain an early-retirement program to his workers, the then 50-year-old decided he’d be the first to go. Kusakabe now runs Quadrac, a start-up developing cellphone chips, building on the subway fast-pass he invented for Sony that’s used in Japan and Hong Kong to buy groceries and concert tickets, as well as pay for fares.

If the inventor has his way, his chips will one day let consumers make purchases with a wave of their hand -- using faint signals beamed through the body from a phone in their pocket or bag.

More clues to how Sony lost its way can be found above the company museum near its Tokyo HQ, where retired Vice Chairman Morio still keeps an office after half a century with Sony. A bronze bust of founder Ibuka in thick-rimmed glasses greets visitors as they step out of the elevator on the second floor.

“My generation, who took orders directly from the founders, we were never questioned about a profit margin. Not once,” Morio said. “We just wanted to be the first with groundbreaking products.”

Strait-Jacket

By the time Morio became an executive, he said, the numbers had become a strait-jacket. Japan’s economic bubble had burst, and the analog era Sony dominated was being replaced by digital technologies that leveled the playing field for new entrants. By 1999, the company already had 185,000 workers, more than four times today’s Google Inc.

An evaluation system that tracked return on investment at each of Sony’s businesses discouraged managers from betting on innovations as long as older technologies were still making money. That was a big reason Sony was slow to switch to flat-panel TVs, surrendering its lead to Korean competitors, said Sea-Jin Chang, author of “Sony Vs. Samsung.”

“We were focused on the short-term, and that’s not the way you build for the future,” Morio said. “If I get a meeting with Hirai, I plan to tell him, ‘It’s not your fault. Your responsibility is to find new businesses so the president 10 years from now doesn’t have to do the same things.’”",27/09/2013
NewsDay,'Intensifed' Global Effort Needed to Further Cut Child Deaths: Report,"Even in the best-case scenario, only 15 countries are projected to meet targets to reduce child deaths by 2035, a new study says.

The targets were set by international health agencies as a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals,a United Nations initiative that expires in 2015.

Rates of child and mother deaths have fallen in most countries since 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals were set. However, efforts to improve mothers' and children's health must intensify to keep achieving significant reductions in the number of child deaths in low- and middle-income countries, according to the authors of the study, which appears Sept. 19 in The Lancet.

""While falling rates of maternal and child deaths are to be welcomed, our analysis shows that if historical trends continue, there will still be 5.4 million deaths in children under 5 in 2035,"" lead author Dr. Neff Walker, of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a journal news release.

""This number could be more than halved if all countries were able to match the performance of countries which have made the best improvements in recent years,"" Walker added. ""Governments -- both of the countries most affected by maternal and child deaths, and of nations providing development assistance -- must redouble their efforts to deliver known and proven interventions at high and sustained levels and search for new interventions that will save the lives of more children.""

He and his colleagues analyzed data from 69 low- and middle-income nations. Fifty-eight of the countries included in the study were from 75 ""Countdown to 2015"" countries, which account for more than 90 percent of all mother and child deaths worldwide.

""Countdown to 2015"" is a movement of academics, governments, international agencies, health-care professional associations, donors, and nongovernmental organizations worldwide that works in partnership with The Lancet to support progress toward meeting the Millennium goals.

The researchers used the results from the 69 countries to project deaths to 2035 for all Countdown countries except South Sudan, for which there was too little data.

If current trends continue, the number of countries where the death rate for children younger than age 5 would be less than 20 per 1,000 would increase from four of the 74 Countdown countries in 2010 to nine in 2035, according to the study. However, if all countries matched the improvements seen in the best-performing countries, 15 of the 74 Countdown countries would be able to achieve that lower death rate.

Put another way, the number of under-5 deaths in the 74 Countdown countries would decrease from 7.6 million in 2010 to 5.4 million in 2035 if current trends continue, and fall to 2.3 million deaths if all countries could match the improvements in the best-performing countries.

""Both malaria and HIV interventions were introduced in the late 1990s, and benefited from high financial investment and political commitment. They are examples of what is possible, and of what needs to be done for other highly effective maternal and child health interventions,"" Walker said.

NewsDay,Filler: Ban on gay blood donations is unnecessary,"If you donate blood, you know the questionnaire is so mind-numbing that it's kind of hard to fill in properly. You start checking off boxes so fast that mistakes happen.

Nurse: ""So you are pregnant, take intravenous drugs and recently spent a year in Haiti?""

Me: ""Did I check all the 'yes' boxes in the 'no' row again?""

Nurse: ""Actually, I'm more worried about you checking the 'mad cow disease' box.""

Me: ""Honestly, I think I just had like a touch of the 24-hour mad cow disease. It was more like 'resentful heifer sniffles.' ""

The questions are all on the honor system because the real safeguard of the blood supply isn't our willingness to be honest. After all, what happens in Quogue stays in Quogue. What safeguards the blood supply are the tests run on each donation.

And that's why the lifetime ban on donations by gay and bisexual men needs to end.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The American Medical Association voted to oppose the lifetime ban in June. And in August more than 80 members of Congress wrote to the Department of Health and Human Services decrying the policy.

That ban was imposed 30 years ago, and it made sense. Blood tests to find HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, were not as good as they are now: If such a ban had not been implemented then, faith in the blood supply would have plummeted.

Now, according to a Centers for Disease Control report, the chances of getting HIV through a transfusion are 1.5 million to 1. The only danger is the slight possibility that a donor would have contracted HIV so recently that the screening tests missed it.

Even 1.5 million to 1 is a chance we shouldn't take, and there's no reason we have to, even if we let gay men give.

The risk of having undetected HIV in your blood doesn't come from being a gay man, or even having had a gay ""just experimenting"" phase in college that, like your quest for a degree, lasted 11 years. It comes from having had such sex recently enough that the virus could sneak past a screening. That period is now just days.

And gay men aren't the only risk. About 28 percent of infections are caused by heterosexual sex, and a quarter of victims are women.

Based on that, it's as reasonable to ban a woman from donating if she's had unprotected sex with a man ""even once"" as it is to ban a man who's had sex with another man once.

The questionnaire is limited, and it has to be. If we eliminated every person who could possibly have contracted HIV, there wouldn't be anyone left. For instance, the sheet asks women if they've ever slept with a man who has slept with another man, but not if they've had unprotected sex with 188 guys who haven't slept with other men (or could be, gosh, lying about it). Since, as all children of the 1980s know, every time you sleep with a person, you're sleeping with every decision they ever made after seven Zimas, this is relevant.

The Food and Drug Administration says the lifetime ban will be eased ""only if supported by scientific data showing that a change in policy would not present a significant and preventable risk to blood recipients."" But again, that ban is not against donating. It's against donating if you're gay and don't check the ""I'm so not gay"" box. As far as I know, the NSA hasn't figured out a way to track these behaviors yet.

The Red Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks and America's Blood Centers have told the FDA the ban is medically and scientifically unwarranted. What isn't bigoted and might protect the blood supply more is to ask anyone, gay or straight, who's had unsafe sex over the past three months not to donate.

And just to be sure, anyone who's ever had more than three Zimas at a sitting, or 24 in their lifetime.

NewsDay,"For Uninfected Partner, Antiretroviral Drugs May Shield Against HIV","Antiretroviral drugs can provide a high level of protection against HIV for uninfected people in heterosexual couples in which the other partner has HIV, according to a new study.

The study included more than 1,100 HIV-uninfected people in Uganda who had a partner with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The participants were given antiretroviral drugs and received counseling support throughout the study to help them adhere to their drug regimen.

The drug adherence rate was 97 percent to 99 percent in the study, which was published Sept. 10 in the journal PLoS Medicine.

After an average follow-up period of 11 months, just 14 of the participants became infected with HIV, according to a journal news release.

The findings provide further proof that strict adherence to what is called antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis offers high levels of protection to uninfected people, said Jessica Haberer, of Harvard Medical School, and colleagues.

The researchers said several previous studies in various groups (such as men who have sex with men, or women at high risk for HIV) have shown that taking antiretroviral drugs provided uninfected people with varying levels of protection against HIV. One possible explanation for the range of findings is different levels of adherence to the antiretroviral drugs, the researchers said.

""Proper support and assessment of adherence will be critical for determining efficacy of [pre-exposure prophylaxis] outside of clinical trials,"" the study authors wrote. ""This data will be important for guiding ethical decisions about resource allocation for both prevention and treatment of HIV.""

NewsDay,New Drug Shows Promise for Type 2 Diabetes,"An injectable drug that mimics the action of a little-known hormone may hold promise for patients with type 2 diabetes.

The experimental drug, called LY, is a copy of a hormone called fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and researchers report that it seems to help protect against obesity and may boost the action of insulin.

In a month-long trial of 46 patients with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to receive daily injections of the drug or an inactive placebo, patients who received the highest doses of the drug saw significant, favorable changes in their blood fat (lipid) levels compared to those on the dummy shots. Two ""bad"" blood fats -- LDL and triglycerides -- dropped, while patients' HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol, increased. Total cholesterol counts also dropped significantly compared to placebo shots.

Patients on the highest doses of the drug also lost a bit of weight, the researchers added.

Insulin and blood sugar levels did dip a bit in patients on the highest doses of the drug, but those changes were not statistically significant compared to patients who were taking the placebo shots, which means they could simply have been a coincidence.

Still, the study authors said they were hopeful that the drug may one day become a useful addition to currently available therapies.

""Our current understanding suggests that FGF21 has the ability to favorably affect body weight, partially normalize abnormal lipid levels in patients with diabetes, and has the potential to improve glycemic control,"" said senior study author Dr. Dave Moller, vice president of endocrinology and cardiovascular research, and clinical investigation for Eli Lilly Co., the company that's developing the drug.

""These are substantial issues and unmet medical needs for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes,"" he added.

The study is published in the Sept. 3 issue of the journal Cell Metabolism.

An endocrinologist who was not involved in the research said the effects of the experimental medication were intriguing.

""There are some interesting properties here that longer studies and bigger numbers will need to confirm,"" said Dr. Ronald Goldberg, a professor of medicine in the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. ""This is early days for this new medication.""

Goldberg said a longer study would be needed to see if the changes in blood fat levels and weight amounted to real benefits for patients with diabetes, such as a reduction in heart attacks or other complications of the disease.

So far, other drugs that raise good cholesterol and lower triglycerides have not demonstrated real benefits for patients.

And side effects could be a concern. Even though the study was short, there were some signs that the medication might not be well-tolerated, the report indicated.

One patient on the highest dose of the drug developed a serious allergic reaction to the medication including a drop in blood pressure, itching and hives, and had to be treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines.

While no other serious allergic reactions were reported, more than 80 percent of patients on the two highest doses of the drug developed antibodies to the protein, a sign that their body recognized the drug as foreign and was mounting an immune reaction against it, something that might diminish the effectiveness of the medication over time.

""That's definitely an issue,"" Goldberg said, adding that he thought scientists would probably try to tweak the drug to make it less likely to spur immune reactions.

NewsDay,Scientists Tally Viruses Living in Mammals,"At a minimum, 320,000 viruses exist among mammals, according to a new study. Identifying these infectious organisms could help alleviate disease outbreaks through early detection -- but compiling evidence on these viruses would cost up to $6.3 billion, researchers say.

However, this hefty price tag is just a small fraction of the economic toll that is caused by major pandemics, like SARS, according to researchers at the Center for Infection and Immunity (CII) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.

Prevention of viral outbreaks is critical because antiviral medications are often difficult to develop, the authors pointed out in a school news release.

""For decades, we've faced the threat of future pandemics without knowing how many viruses are lurking in the environment, in wildlife, waiting to emerge. Finally we have a breakthrough -- there aren't millions of unknown virus, just a few hundred thousand, and given the technology we have it's possible that in my lifetime, we'll know the identity of every unknown virus on the planet,"" study corresponding author, Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, said in the news release.

Although 70 percent of new viral diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, West Nile and SARS, are infections that cross from animals into humans (known as zoonoses), the researchers say their estimate is the first to project the number of viruses among any wildlife species.

""Historically, our whole approach to discovery has been altogether too random,"" lead study author Simon Anthony, a CII scientist, said in the news release. ""What we currently know about viruses is very much biased towards those that have already spilled over into humans or animals and emerged as diseases. But the pool of all viruses in wildlife, including many potential threats to humans, is actually much deeper.""

For the study, published Sept. 3 in the journal mBio, a multidisciplinary team of researchers examined the flying fox, a type of bat that lives in the jungles of Bangladesh. Flying foxes, the largest flying mammal with a wingspan of up to six feet, are the source of several outbreaks of Nipah virus.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Researchers collected nearly 1,900 biological samples from the bats before releasing them back into the wild, and identified 55 viruses in nine viral families. Only five viruses were previously known. Among the new discoveries were 10 related to Nipah virus.

The study authors also estimated that there were another three rare viruses, which were unaccounted for in the samples collected. After increasing the total estimate of viruses in the flying fox to 58, the researchers extrapolated their data to include all 5,486 known mammals. They calculated that there are at least 320,000 viruses.

Based on the cost of collecting their data on the flying fox, the researchers concluded that the cost to observe, sample and identify viruses in all mammals would reach $6.3 billion. By excluding rare viruses and limiting the exercise to 85 percent of all viruses among mammals, the cost would be reduced to $1.4 billion.

""By contrast, the economic impact of the SARS pandemic is calculated to be $16 billion. We're not saying that this undertaking would prevent another outbreak like SARS. Nonetheless, what we learn from exploring global viral diversity could mitigate outbreaks by facilitating better surveillance and rapid diagnostic testing,"" Anthony said. ""If we know what's out there, we'll be a lot better prepared when a virus jumps over into a human population,"" he noted in the news release.

Senior study author, Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, director of CII, added: ""Our goal is to provide the viral intelligence needed for the global public health community to anticipate and respond to the continuous challenge of emerging infectious diseases.""

NewsDay,LIers volunteer at Crossroads Farm,"It's not unusual to find college student Holly Josephs knee-deep in fertile soil at Crossroads Farm in Malverne. Or electrical engineer Victor Perez building raised beds. Biology professor Carol St. Angelo is probably yanking weeds.

This particular scene is rooted in familiarity -- just ask any of the 150 active volunteers who dedicate hundred of hours seasonally to the revived three-year-old farm run by the conservation nonprofit Nassau Land Trust. With only five employed staffers on the 4.5 acre farm, director Meaghan Corcoran says the majority of the work needed for a successful growing season falls on volunteers.

""Right now, corn is a pretty hot item,"" says Josephs, 19. The Bethpage resident volunteers four days a week when she's not off at school, arriving at 10 a.m. to prep the farm stand for its opening. ""So much of the setup time is spent displaying the corn.""

The farm stand sells seasonal produce grown there -- such as carrots and tomatoes -- but also organic goods such as honey from nearby growers.

When Josephs finishes at the farm stand, she heads outside to harvest crops, plant more seeds and work in the field -- and she's not the only one pulling weeds.

""Weeding can be nice, let me tell you,"" says St. Angelo, 52, of Malverne. ""It can be very relaxing.""

On another day, Perez, 39, of Valley Stream is working on raised beds needed to transplant seedlings from the greenhouse. ""Every day is different,"" says Perez, who usually helps out on the farm two days a week before heading to his job. ""I get more involved with nature, and that's what I absolutely like.""

THE CHORES ""Volunteers come in every category you could think of,"" says Rick White, 55, a Nassau Land Trust board member from Malverne who also helps out at the farm. Retiree Bruce Travins, 70, of West Hempstead, volunteers for perhaps the most specialized duty of all: beekeeper.

When he's not checking on the hives or collecting honey, Travens, a retired educator, is teaching younger volunteers about the nature of bees.

Other regular duties include -- but are not limited to -- mowing the lawn, tilling the fields, making and painting garden labels, sowing seeds and working the farm stand's register.

VOLUNTEER PERKS Sure, volunteers often are invited to take home past-prime produce and small samples of freshly harvested crops, ""but we don't have an official rewards program yet,"" says Corcoran.

For many, the rewards are intangible.

""I've had a wonderful experience volunteering on the farm,"" says Leland Jacob, 63, of East Rockaway.

NewsDay,Arsenio Hall picks up where he left off on late night,"A flashback.

Make that a very distant flashback -- to May 27, 1994.

""I'd like to thank America,"" said the gifted, black late-night host in a sharply bespoke suit -- mauve, if memory serves, however dimly -- on the last night of his celebrated show, where he liked to say ""Hollywood meets the 'hood.""

""But most of all, I'd like to thank God: This has been the greatest five and a half years anyone could ever hope for."" Then, turning his eyes to the camera, this:

""I won't see you in 23 hours, but I will see you again.""

Promise kept.

Arsenio Hall returns with a new late-night show beginning Sept. 9, airing locally on WPIX/11 at 11. In a recent phone interview about his hopes (and dreams) for this return, Hall almost reflexively said, ""I don't need to be on the cover of Time magazine, but I'd love to just be in the game.""

Subscribe to the Entertainment newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

About that magazine: On Nov. 13, 1989, when such coronations really mattered, Time crowned Hall with a cover declaiming him the coolest kid on the late-night TV block. ""The Arsenio Hall Show,"" which launched Jan. 3, 1989, had brought an urban beat and party-every-night vibe to a moment of the TV day that been dominated by Johnny Carson and his sensibilities for nearly three decades. About 4 million tuned in every night, denting Carson's ""Tonight"" ratings and even -- if you believed some of the hype at the time -- accelerating his retirement plans. Hall's show didn't feel like an alternative as much as a movement, to bring black culture into an all-white club. Studio audiences loved it. So -- for a time -- did audiences at home.

Then, on May 27, 1994, the party ended. Hall had it all, then lost it all -- unless you count a few episodes of ""Martial Law,"" assorted cameos and a ""Celebrity Apprentice"" victory over the intervening years as ""found.""

A COMPLICATED SAGA

Why did he leave Stage 29 on the Paramount lot in the first place, and why is he back on another stage? (The new show will be taped at the Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood.) The saga is complicated, but it's also clear that the answers to both questions are related. Hall thrived, then left as the tectonic plates of late-night TV shifted. They are about to shift once again. Jay Leno will leave ""Tonight"" in February, while the future of ""Late Show With David Letterman"" -- though certainly secure for now -- is a question. Audiences tend to check around when hosts change; that was true in the early '90s, and it still holds true.

As Hall said recently, ""Obviously, back in the day, I was trying to take anything that was left over on Carson's plate. It's a huge challenge this time to bring people to the television. But I [also] know that everybody doesn't have a late-night host.""

Born in Cleveland 57 years ago, Hall early found an aptitude for magic, debate -- and comedy. After graduating from Kent State, he headed west -- first to Chicago, then Los Angeles, in search of a stand-up career, and landed at West Hollywood's Comedy Store, one of the premiere venues for budding and established comics, and where former club MC and future ""Hall"" writer Steven Alan Green recalled Hall as someone with ""incredible positive energy.""

That energy landed him gigs on TV -- including a voice on the animated kid hit ""The Real Ghostbusters"" -- and ultimately Fox's ""The Late Show,"" where he was the show's last host before it was canceled in 1988. While there, he established some of the late-night trademarks, notably the audience's ""woof woof"" arm pump, that were to become signatures of his next late-night show. (The ""dog pound"" -- comprising particularly enthusiastic woofers on the stage near the house band, the Posse -- came later.)

A BIG MONEYMAKER

Fox wanted him to stick around, but after ""Late Show,"" Hall signed a deal with Paramount to star in Eddie Murphy's ""Coming to America."" After that, Paramount created his late-night syndicated vehicle, which Hall was prescient enough to secure an ownership stake in. It was an instant success: He embraced black culture, especially rap, which secured its most important TV venue, after ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand,"" to date. Salt-N-Pepa, Arrested Development, Queen Latifah as well as Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Tupac Shakur and Ice T were all frequent guests. For a brief moment, the show was believed to be Paramount's most financially successful TV venture, a $40-million-a-year machine.

Then, those tectonic plates shifted. CBS, which launched Letterman's show in '93, pulled ""Arsenio"" off some of its own big stations for the new venture. (Fox did the same with many of its stations for ""The Chevy Chase Show"" in the fall of '93.) ""Arsenio"" ratings, which already had been dropping, plummeted. Relations with Paramount went from bad to worse, with the nadir when Hall booked Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan for a full hour in February 1994. Hugely controversial for perceived anti-Semitic views dating from the mid-'80s, Hall pressed Farrakhan on nothing. Paramount execs were incensed, and Hall, as the relationship fell apart, was embittered. Hall now insists there was ""never anything negative"" in the split, but that he told Paramount, ""I needed balance in my life. Not only personally, but professionally. I wanted to try other things.

""I'm from Cleveland. I grew up down the street from Jim Brown. He left while he still could play. That was cool to me as a kid. So leaving and not being canceled, yeah, that sounded good.""

There is the slightest irony to the new show: It will be produced by CBS, which catalyzed his doom all those years ago. And when asked about bookings, the new show's executive producer, Neal Kendall, will say only: ""We have a few things up our sleeves.""

Don't expect Farrakhan, though Hall has joked (or maybe not) that he'd like Beyoncé and Jay Z's baby, Blue Ivy Carter, as a guest.

What else to expect with his new show, beyond the standard late-night talk elements? Maybe -- just maybe -- some of that old Hall magic. He's got a band headed by Robin DiMaggio, a top session drummer who has recorded with Diana Ross and Paul Simon. He's also got a studio audience that will doubtless woof -- but no ""dog pound.""

""Being in late night is very much like running for an office,"" says Hall. ""Basically, what I do is just assert my personality, and you hope people will hang with you a couple nights a week.""

Kendall, who says Hall ""looks 35 and still has the same energy and passion for doing this,"" will mount a very similar show with similar elements, ""but it won't be a nostalgia trip.

""He said to me that 'I just want to make it feel like I took a really long weekend and came back and picked up right from where I left off.' ""

Memories from the first time around

Five and a half years yielded more than a few memorable moments from ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" (1989-94). Here are six:

Candidate Bill Clinton plays ""Heartbeak Hotel"" on his sax, in one of the most memorable moments of the 1992 campaign. It was followed by a thoughtful Q&A about voter apathy, and a discussion of the deep-seated problems of South Central Los Angeles, parts of which were still in ruins after recent riots.

Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan -- immediately after repudiating anti-Semitic remarks made by an aide -- agrees to appear on the show, but the resulting hourlong edition turned out to be a skate for Farrakhan.

Hall berates representatives of Queer Nation, who, as audience members, shouted out questions over why he did not have gay guests on the show. ""Now, this ain't Merv [Griffin] he shot back. I ain't gonna run from it."" And then he lost his temper: ""You think I didn't have someone on the show because they're gay? What's wrong with you, man? I'm black.""

Jim Henson is a guest on the show in early May 1990 -- shortly before his death on May 16. This was believed to be one of his last TV appearances.

Muhammad Ali is interviewed by Hall, while Sugar Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson make surprise appearances. Who -- Hall asks Ali -- would have won had Tyson and Ali stepped into a ring? Ali points to Tyson.

Magic Johnson, in his first late-night TV interview shortly after revealing he was HIV-positive, appears in 1991.",30/08/2013

Thousands of Men Warned About Faulty PSA Tests

Thousands of men in central Pennsylvania have been told that their blood tests for prostate cancer may have been inaccurate.

Pinnacle Health of Harrisburg sent letters to 7,500 men to alert them that a faulty chemical in their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests led to results showing higher levels of PSA than were actually present, ABC News reported.

Significantly elevated PSA levels may be a sign of prostate cancer and often lead to prostate biopsies. The faulty tests were used at Pinnacle from May 2012 to June 26, 2013.

It's likely that the Pinnacle Health patients are just the tip of the iceberg, because all lots of the ""IMMULITE"" PSA tests were recalled June 27 by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. The company shipped the faulty tests to labs from February 2012 through May 2013, ABC News reported.

Porn Industry Halted After Actor's Positive HIV Test

The U.S. porn industry has temporarily halted production of adult films after an actor tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

The performer wasn't named and officials didn't reveal when the positive test was recorded, CBS News/Associated Press reported.

The actor's sex partners are undergoing tests by doctors with Adult Production Health and Safety Services, which works with the porn industry.

""The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated,"" Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the AP in an email. The actor is not believed to have been infected on a film set, she added.

Last year, the porn industry briefly ceased filming after nearly a dozen performers were infected with syphilis. An HIV scare in 2011 also halted production, but filming resumed when a re-test showed the actor did not have HIV, CBS News/AP reported.",23/08/2013
NewsDay,"Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers Aren't Cure-Alls, FDA Warns","Despite claims on some websites, there is no evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy cures or is an effective treatment for diseases such as cancer, autism, diabetes or other diseases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is approved by the FDA for certain medical uses, including treating decompression sickness suffered by divers, carbon monoxide poisoning and burns caused by heat or fire.

But claims made by some treatment centers that hyperbaric oxygen therapy can help with a wide range of health issues are misleading and may put people's health at risk, according to the FDA.

""Patients may incorrectly believe that these devices have been proven safe and effective for uses not cleared by the FDA, which may cause them to delay or forgo proven medical therapies,"" Nayan Patel, a biomedical engineer in the FDA's anesthesiology devices branch, said Thursday in an agency news release. ""In doing so, they may experience a lack of improvement and/or worsening of their existing conditions.""

The safety and effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has not been established for the following diseases and conditions: HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, Bell's palsy, brain injuries, cerebral palsy, depression, heart disease, hepatitis, migraines, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, sports injuries and stroke.

The FDA has received 27 complaints from consumers and health care professionals over the past three years about treatment centers promoting the hyperbaric chamber for uses not approved by the agency, Patel said.

Hyperbaric therapy involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber where atmospheric pressure is raised up to three times higher than normal. In this way, the lungs can gather up to three times more oxygen than possible by breathing oxygen at normal air pressure.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The therapy increases the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood, and an increase in blood oxygen helps tissues fight infection or recover from injury, Patel said.

Patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy, however, are at risk of mild injuries, such as sinus pain, ear pressure and painful joints, or serious problems, such as paralysis and air embolisms, which are dangerous bubbles in the bloodstream that obstruct circulation. Since hyperbaric chambers are oxygen-rich environments, a risk of fire also exists.

""If you're considering using [hyperbaric oxygen therapy], it's essential that you first discuss all possible options with your health care professional,"" Patel said. ""Whatever treatment you're getting, you need to understand its benefits and risks. Your health care professional can help you determine which treatment is your best option.""

NewsDay,Early Course of HIV Therapy May Give Infants a Break From Drugs,"Giving immediate drug therapy to HIV-infected infants for a limited period of time protects their immune system and delays the start of lifelong treatment, according to a new study.

HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.

Currently, infants who begin so-called antiretroviral therapy must continue for life. However, long-term use of the therapy increases their risk of drug-related toxicity and drug resistance, according to background information in the study published Aug. 22 in The Lancet.

""This important finding indicates we may be able to temporarily stop treatment and spare infants from some of the toxic effects of continuous [antiretroviral therapy] for a while, if we can monitor them carefully,"" study co-leader Mark Cotton, a professor at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, said in a journal news release.

""With [antiretroviral therapy] coverage in children currently at just 28 percent, our findings highlight the urgency of increasing early (within the first 3 months of life) testing and treatment of HIV-infected infants,"" he added.

The researchers looked at five years of follow-up data from 377 HIV-infected infants who, at ages 6 weeks to 12 weeks in 2005, were randomly selected to begin immediate short-term antiretroviral therapy of 40 weeks or 96 weeks, or to wait until they showed signs of illness or a weakened immune system before beginning treatment.

On average, infants in the delayed-treatment group needed to begin taking lifelong therapy 20 weeks after the start of the study. In comparison, those completing the immediate course of treatment for 40 weeks were able to then delay restarting treatment for an average 33 weeks, and those who completed the immediate course of 96 weeks of treatment were able to delay restarting treatment for an average 70 weeks, the investigators found.

By the end of the trial, nearly 20 percent of infants who were given 40 weeks of early treatment and about one-third of infants who received 96 weeks of initial antiretroviral treatment were still well enough to avoid restarting what would eventually become lifelong treatment.

The researchers also found that the delayed-treatment group had a significantly higher number of deaths and hospital admissions, and had higher health care costs than the groups of infants who received immediate, temporary antiretroviral therapy.

""Early treatment followed by a break is definitely better and more cost-effective than delaying starting infants on treatment. But we do not know if a longer initial period of treatment, or early continuous treatment, might be even better,"" study co-leader Dr. Avy Violari, from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, said in the news release.

NewsDay,Skin Allergies Can Flare Up in Summer Heat,"Summer can be a particularly bad time for skin allergies such as eczema and hives, as well as reactions to poison ivy, oak and sumac, an expert says.

This summer, high rainfall, humidity and temperatures combined with increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air have resulted in an ""exceedingly potent"" growth of poison ivy-related plants, said Dr. Leonard Bielory, an allergy specialist with the Rutgers Center of Environmental Prediction and an attending physician at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J.

""When picnicking or hiking though our parks this summer, beware of certain plants, especially some trees,"" he said in a hospital news release. ""Many trees have leaves that are actually part of the (allergenic plant) vines that have embraced them.""

Some of these allergenic plant vines are extremely large and clearly noticeable, said Bielory, recalling the saying that helps people avoid these troublesome plants: ""Leaves of three, let them be.""

Bielory added: ""Some individuals are sensitive to the point that their conditions can flare up when in contact with grass or other plants. For protection, wear long pants and long sleeves if outdoor plants cause a reaction.""

He also offered tips to prevent eczema and hives or at least reduce their symptoms:

Be careful when outdoors. Heat or sweat can trigger hives. Drink plenty of fluids, avoid becoming too hot and use sunscreen.

Be prepared. Eczema can get worse in the summer, especially with added sweating. Have a skin care treatment plan. This may include using mild bathing products.

NewsDay,"HIV Patients Get a Mental Lift From Exercise, Study Finds","Regular exercise can give a brain boost to people with HIV, according to a new study.

Trouble with memory and thinking, something doctors call ""neurocognitive impairment,"" affects nearly half of people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It can interfere with the ability to do daily tasks such as handling finances, driving and taking medication as scheduled, experts say.

However, the new study suggests that exercise ""may reduce or potentially prevent neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected persons,"" according to a team led by Dr. David Moore of the University of California, San Diego.

Their study included 335 people with HIV who were asked how much they exercised. They also underwent testing to assess seven brain functions commonly affected by HIV: verbal fluency, working memory, speed of information processing, learning, recall, executive function and motor function.

Those who got regular exercise were half as likely to show signs of impaired mental function as those who did not exercise, according to the study published in the August issue of the Journal of NeuroVirology.

The major benefit of exercise in people with HIV seems to be the reduction of risk factors that can affect the brain such as high blood pressure and abnormally high levels of fats in the blood, Moore said.

The findings add to previous research showing a link between exercise and brain health in people with HIV.

NewsDay,Newspaper art director George Delmerico dies,"An art director and graphic designer, George Delmerico made a mark in the 1970s as newspapers sought to enhance their looks by producing eye-catching layouts.

Hired as the first art director for the glossy Sunday magazine Newsday launched in 1972, he went on to work for The New York Times and The Village Voice, having earlier worked for New York magazine.

Delmerico, 67, died Sunday of a heart attack at a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., said Ken Volok, his partner of nearly 20 years.

Delmerico ""was a light that lit up the room with his smile,"" Volok said.

Delmerico has said he made his 1976 move to The Village Voice ""at the request of Milton Glaser, my dear, incredible mentor"" and that his experience there ""changed my life drastically . . . for which I am as per the usual nonsense, 'eternally grateful.' ""

At Newsday, ""he did a very good job for us,"" producing innovative layouts -- ""good-looking stuff,"" said Stan Green, then the Sunday magazine's managing editor.

""He was more of a coach than a boss,"" said Miriam Smith, whom Delmerico hired as an assistant designer for the Newsday magazine. When an error she made came to light on her first week on the job, Delmerico simply said, ""OK, we'll take care of it,"" never saying she was responsible or chewing her out. ""That just made me love him,"" said Smith, now an art director with City University of New York.

Also a designer of book and album covers, Delmerico created a poster featuring Marvel Comics superhero images for a 1972 multimedia comic book presentation Stan Lee did at Carnegie Hall, said his sister, Nancy Delmerico Vitagliano, of Dobbs Ferry.

Born and raised in Dobbs Ferry, Delmerico received a fine arts degree from the Pratt Institute in New York City and studied at the Royal College of Art in London.

Moving to Santa Barbara in 1985, he worked for the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper and, until his 1995 retirement, served as publications director for the University of California at Santa Barbara, according to his family. A survivor of HIV for more than 20 years, he also did pro bono work for area community groups, his family said.

A music lover, he enjoyed creating playlists for friends and family, and curating audio compilations, said Delmerico Vitagliano, who worked for Newsday's Kidsday staff in the early 1980s.

NewsDay,New Drug Approved to Treat HIV-1,"Tivicay (dolutegravir) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat infection with HIV-1, a strain of the virus that causes AIDS.

The drug, among a class called integrase strand transfer inhibitors, interferes with an enzyme that HIV needs to multiply. It's been approved in combination with other antiretroviral drugs and for people aged 12 and older who weigh at least 40 kilograms (approximately 88 pounds), the FDA said in a news release.

Some 50,000 Americans acquire HIV infection each year, and about 15,500 people died from the disease in 2010, the agency said, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The drug's safety and effectiveness were evaluated in clinical studies involving more than 2,500 adults and children, the FDA said. The most common side effects included difficulty sleeping, headache and more serious problems including allergic-like reactions and abnormal liver function in people who had hepatitis B or C.

NewsDay,"Sean Sasser, boyfriend of 'Real World' star Pedro Zamora, dead at 44","AIDS activist Sean Sasser, who helped bring a sympathetic awareness of the disease to many Americans when he appeared on MTV's ""The Real World: San Francisco,"" has died at 44.

His husband, Michael Kaplan, posted on Facebook that Sasser, who was HIV-positive, died Wednesday of mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer. He later confirmed the news to CNN.

One ""Real World"" housemate, DC Comics writer Judd Winick, tweeted late Wednesday, ""Our friend Sean Sasser has died. Our love goes out to his family & husband Michael. We will miss u so much.""

Sasser, born Oct. 25, 1968, entered the public consciousness on the 1994 edition of the MTV reality series, in which several young people share a house. He was the boyfriend of cast member Pedro Zamora, one of the first openly gay men on American television, whose struggle with AIDS was chronicled on the show. Zamora died of AIDS-related causes Nov. 11, 1994, a day after the final episode aired. He and Sasser had exchanged commitment vows on that finale, a televised first.

Sasser, who remained active in AIDS awareness, later lived in Portland, Ore. He recently moved to Washington, D.C., where Kaplan had taken a job running the nonprofit organization AIDS United and Sasser found work as a pastry chef at the restaurant Ris. Kaplan told CNN the two had dated off and on for years since the 1990s, but moved in together about six years ago. Kaplan said his remains would be cremated.",09/08/2013
NewsDay,Rapid Test Detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 Antibodies and HIV-1 Antigen,"The first rapid test to detect the HIV-1 antigen, as well as blood antibodies for the HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo test can detect these markers for the AIDS-causing virus in human serum, plasma and blood specimens, the agency said in a news release.

Detection of the HIV-1 antigen may allow doctors to diagnose the viral infection earlier than detection of the antibodies alone, the FDA said.

Some 50,000 people are infected with HIV each year in the United States, the agency said, citing statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the more than 1 million people living with HIV in the United States, about 20 percent haven't been diagnosed, the FDA added.

The new test is produced by Orgenics Ltd., whose parent, Alere Inc., is based in Yavne, Israel.

NewsDay,"Stomach Bug Outbreak Grows, Bagged Salad Implicated","The ongoing outbreak of stomach illness linked to the cyclospora parasite has now spread to 15 states and New York City, with 378 cases reported, according to the latest U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report issued Wednesday.

The source or sources of the nationwide outbreak has not yet been located, although health officials at two of the hardest-hit states, Iowa and Nebraska, say they have traced local outbreaks to an as-yet-unnamed salad mix.

In a posting on its website, the CDC said that it ""will continue to work with federal, state, and local partners in the investigation to determine whether this conclusion applies to the increase in cases of cyclosporiasis in other states. It is not yet clear whether the cases from all of the states are part of the same outbreak.""

Prior outbreaks of cyclospora infection have typically been caused by tainted produce, the agency noted.

While no one has died from cyclosporiasis, ""at least 21 persons reportedly have been hospitalized in three states,"" the CDC said. Most people got sick between mid-June through early July.

Cases have now been reported from Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin.

Cases of cyclosporiasis, which is caused by a single-celled parasite and can trigger diarrhea and stomach cramps, have been mounting through the month of July, said Dr. Monica Parise, chief of the parasitic diseases branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cyclospora parasite cannot be spread from person to person; it has to be ingested via contaminated water or foods such as fruit and vegetables.

""It can be pretty miserable, because it can give diarrhea that can last for days,"" Parise said.

Cyclospora is a tiny parasite but is devastatingly effective, added Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.

""You can ingest as few as 10 of these little critters and get sick,"" Hirsch said.

The first reported cases occurred in Iowa, which has been hardest hit with 143 people falling ill so far. The first cases came in late June, with more infections reported through July.

Other states reporting large numbers of infections are Nebraska, with 78 cases, and Texas, with 101 cases.

It takes about a week for people who are infected to become sick.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, CDC director, urged people who have suffered from diarrhea longer than a couple of days to be tested for cyclospora. Antibiotics can be used to treat severe cases of infection.

Earlier outbreaks of cyclospora have been traced back to fruits and vegetables imported from tropical regions like Latin America and Southeast Asia, where the parasite is common, Parise and Hirsch said.

""Our food supply system is large, complex and centralized. We get foods from all over the world, and they are packaged together and sent very, very quickly,"" Hirsch said. ""I look at large outbreaks like this, and it makes me wonder if more locally grown foods would be safer.""

People who want to avoid infection should thoroughly wash all their fruits and vegetables, Hirsch said. They also should wash cooking surfaces and utensils with hot, soapy water.

""For the most part, it's a miserable nuisance, but the concern I have as a doctor is for patients whose immune systems are weakened [and] have a real hard time with this infection,"" Hirsch said. He urged extra caution for people undergoing cancer treatment, recovering from an organ transplant or dealing with HIV infection.

NewsDay,Survival Picture No Better for Patients With HIV-Related Lymphoma: Study,"Survival rates for patients with HIV-associated lymphoma have not improved since antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available, according to a new study.

HIV, the AIDS-causing virus, raises the risk of lymphoma, a blood cancer, which is the most common cancer-related cause of death among people with HIV.

""These results highlight an ongoing need to ... optimize treatments for this challenging population to reduce deaths from one of the leading causes of mortality in the [antiretroviral therapy] era,"" said Dr. Satish Gopal, of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina.

For the study, published July 26 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers examined data from nearly 500 patients diagnosed with HIV-associated lymphoma between 1996 and 2010.

Patients diagnosed more recently were older and more likely to be male, gay, Hispanic, and to have had prior HIV-related illnesses. They also were more likely to be on antiretroviral therapy when diagnosed with lymphoma, with higher CD4 counts and better HIV control.

But these recently diagnosed patients did not have a lower risk of death five years after diagnosis than those diagnosed earlier in the study period.

Moreover, lymphomas diagnosed in patients on antiretroviral therapy were associated with twice the risk of death, the researchers found. This may suggest important biologic differences between lymphomas in patients on and off antiretroviral therapy, and further investigation is required, Gopal and colleagues said in a journal news release.

The types of lymphoma patients had included Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, other non-Hodgkin lymphoma and primary central nervous system lymphoma. The proportion diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma grew during the study period compared to other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the researchers found.

NewsDay,Women With HIV May Suffer More From Hot Flashes,"As women infected with HIV live longer, new evidence is suggesting that menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes may affect them worse than women who don't carry the virus.

""Perimenopausal HIV-infected women experience greater hot flash severity and greater hot flash-related interference with daily activities and quality of life,"" compared to non-infected women going through menopause, report researchers led by Sara Looby of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Excessive menopausal symptoms might even compromise the health of HIV-positive women, including their ability to adhere to drug therapy and abstain from drugs and alcohol, the team said.

Looby and her coleagues urged doctors who care for middle-aged HIV-infected women to evaluate their hot flashes and offer effective treatment.

For the study, the researchers surveyed 33 HIV-infected women, aged 45-48, with irregular menstrual cycles (perimenopause) and compared their responses with those of perimenopausal women without HIV.

The women with HIV typically experienced moderate hot flashes while the women without HIV mild hot flashes. The HIV-infected women also had more sleep problems, more depressed moods, irritability and anxiety.

Hot flashes also interfered more with HIV-infected women's work, social and leisure activities, concentration, relationships with others, sexuality, enjoyment of life and overall quality of life.

In fact, the harmful effect of hot flashes among women with HIV was greater than what has been reported for breast cancer survivors, according to the study published online July 3 in the journal Menopause.

It's not clear why hot flashes are worse in HIV-infected women and further research is needed to learn the answers, the study authors said.

NewsDay,Scientists Use HIV to 'Cure' 2 Rare Genetic Diseases,"Turning a medical foe into a therapeutic friend, Italian scientists say they used a piece of HIV to cure two rare genetic diseases affecting children.

HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.

Gene therapy using the technique proved effective in three children with metachromatic leukodystrophy and three others with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. After three years of treatment, all of them are now well and show significant benefits from the therapy.

""The results obtained from the first six patients are very encouraging: The therapy is not only safe, but also effective and able to change the clinical history of these severe diseases,"" study lead researcher Luigi Naldini, director of the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET), in Milan, said in an institute news release.

The cause of both diseases is a genetic defect that results in the deficiency of a protein essential in the early years of life. In the case of metachromatic leukodystrophy, the nervous system is affected. Babies with this previously incurable disease appear healthy at birth, but at some point they begin to gradually lose the thinking and physical skills they have developed, with no possibility of halting the decline.

Children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have a faulty immune system that makes them much more vulnerable than normal to the development of infections, autoimmune diseases and cancer. They also have a defect in the platelets, which causes frequent bleeding.

In this new therapy, stem cells are taken from the bone marrow of the patient. But a viral vector -- a means of transporting an agent into a cell -- is needed to transport a corrected copy of the gene that is defective into the stem cells. The Italian team obtained just such a viral vector from HIV.

Once reinjected into the body, the treated stem cells are able to restore the missing protein to key organs, the researchers said.

""In patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, blood cells are directly affected by the disease and the corrected stem cells replace the diseased cells, creating a properly functioning immune system and normal platelets,"" said Alessandro Aiuti, head of research of the Pediatric Clinic at TIGET. ""Thanks to gene therapy, the children no longer have to face severe bleeding and infection. They can run, play and go to school.""

""In the case of metachromatic leukodystrophy, however, the therapeutic mechanism is more sophisticated: The corrected [stem] cells reach the brain through the blood and release the correct protein that is 'gathered' there by the surrounding nerve cells,"" colleague Alessandra Biffi said in the news release.

The studies were published July 11 in the journal Science.

NewsDay,Stem cell transplants clear HIV from two U.S. patients,"Two cancer patients in Boston who were also infected with HIV have no trace of the virus after receiving stem-cell transplants, suggesting they may have been cured of the AIDS-causing infection.

The two, treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital, stopped HIV treatment after the transplants, which in other patients has opened the door for the virus to come roaring back. In one patient there was no sign of the virus 15 weeks after stopping treatment; the other has gone seven weeks without HIV rebounding, according to results presented yesterday at the International AIDS Society's meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The researchers, led by Timothy Henrich of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, said it's too early to conclude the two have been cured; the virus may be lingering in their brains or gut. Still, their cases are similar to that of Timothy Brown, who was the first person to be cured of HIV after getting a bone marrow transplant for leukemia in 2007.

""While stem-cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with HIV on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity, these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating, and ultimately even eradicating, HIV,"" said Kevin Robert Frost. He is CEO of The Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), which funded the study.

There was one main difference: the cells Brown received contained a rare genetic mutation called CCR5 that made him resistant to HIV infection. The donors in the new cases lacked that mutation, and the Boston patients didn't undergo the intensive chemotherapy Brown did.

Scientists had believed the CCR5 mutation was key to Brown's being cured. They'll be searching through the new results for clues to whether other genes may hold promise against HIV, Rowena Johnston, amfAR's director of research, said.",03/07/2013
NewsDay,"No Trace of HIV After Stem-Cell Transplants, Researchers Say","Two HIV-positive patients show no trace of virus after receiving chemotherapy and stem-cell transplants as treatment for lymphoma, according to new research.

These patients have become the second and third known cases of a ""sterilizing cure,"" in which medical treatment removes all traces of HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- from the body. They have remained virus-free even though doctors months ago took them off their HIV-targeted medications.

""We have been unable to detect virus in either the blood cells or the plasma of these patients,"" said lead researcher Dr. Timothy Henrich, of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ""We also biopsied gut tissue from one of our patients, and we were unable to detect HIV in the cells of the gut. Essentially, we do not have any evidence of viral rebound.""

The findings are scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the International AIDS Society Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The patients had been receiving long-term antiretroviral therapy for HIV when they developed lymphoma, a type of blood cancer involving white blood cells, Henrich said.

Both underwent chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants to cure their lymphoma. Afterward, Henrich could not detect any HIV infection in their bodies.

Henrich presented preliminary findings on the research at the International AIDS Conference last July. Since then, he and his research team withdrew the patients' antiretroviral therapy to see how completely the cancer treatment had rid them of HIV. One patient has been off treatment with no detectable virus for about 15 weeks, and the second patient for seven weeks.

Henrich warned that it is too soon to declare the patients completely cured of HIV. ""Although we cannot detect HIV, it's possible it's there but in extremely low amounts,"" he said. ""We're going to watch and wait, and see where it goes with these patients.""

Unfortunately, this type of cure is not something that can be put into widespread practice for all people infected with HIV. ""Transplantation is not a scalable, affordable or even safe treatment for HIV patients,"" Henrich said.

The so-called ""Berlin patient,"" Timothy Brown, is the first documented case of a sterilizing cure for HIV. An American man living in Germany who received a bone marrow transplant for leukemia, Brown has remained HIV-free even after discontinuing his antiretroviral drug therapy. The transplanted bone marrow cells came from a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that increases immunity against the most common form of HIV, and researchers believe that helped protect Brown from re-infection.

In Mississippi, a baby born with HIV nearly three years ago is the first case of a ""functional cure,"" in which early treatment eradicates the virus. Immediate treatment with antiretroviral medications rid the child of all traces of HIV within the first month of life, and she has remained virus-free even after discontinuing drug therapy at 18 months of age.

Henrich's findings are significant because his two patients did not receive bone marrow cells with the genetic mutation that helped Brown. They also did not receive the intensive chemotherapy or total body irradiation that preceded Brown's stem-cell transplant.

Instead, their stem-cell transplants appear to have been protected by the patients' ongoing antiretroviral therapy, which continued as they received cancer treatment.

""In bone marrow transplants, the donor cells actually eliminate and replace the host patient's blood cells,"" Henrich said. ""Antiretroviral therapy allowed the donor cells to replace the host cells without becoming infected.""

By comparing Brown with the two new patients, researchers hope to better understand the immune responses that have protected all three, said Rowena Johnston, vice president and director of research for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, which is funding Henrich's research.

""It was quite unclear at the time how that cure came about,"" Johnston said of the Brown case. ""One way these Henrich findings are significant is that they allowed us to tease apart those factors that may have been key to curing Timothy Brown.""

Together, the three patients can tell researchers a lot about the barriers to a cure and how they might be overcome, Johnston continued.

Perhaps some day the treatment that helped these patients will be available to everyone with HIV, she added.

""We currently imagine that curing people on a large scale through stem-cell transplantation would pose many daunting challenges, but gene therapy researchers are working on ways this might one day be possible,"" Johnston said.

Findings presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

NewsDay,Obama joins Bush for ceremony in Tanzania,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama didn't get his anticipated meeting with Nelson Mandela, the man who inspired his political career. Instead, as he ended his Africa trip, he joined with a political foe he followed into the White House.

One of the most unlikely images of Obama's weeklong trip came Tuesday morning in Tanzania when he stood next to former President George W. Bush at a wreath-laying ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in memory of victims of the 1998 terrorist bombing there.

The U.S. presidents, who made no statements, emerged from the embassy compound side by side, walked to the memorial stone under the shade of a tree and bowed their heads in a moment of silence. Obama and Bush then shook hands with six survivors of the attack and their family members, Obama in front and Bush following.

Bush is in Tanzania for a forum his wife, Laura, hosted for African first ladies that also included Michelle Obama. While their husbands stood together in solemn silence, the current and former first ladies were all smiles at a separate event, regaling their audience -- and one another -- with stories about their families.

While Obama campaigned against Bush's legacy, on Africa policy he's following in his predecessor's footsteps. On Monday, Obama credited Bush with saving millions of African lives through his creation of the Pepfar program, a $15 billion commitment to prevent and treat HIV infections.

""I'm looking forward to being able, on African soil, to once again thank him on behalf of the American people for showing how American generosity and foresight could end up making a real difference in people's lives,"" Obama told reporters in Dar es Salaam.

Obama sought to build on Bush's work with a program to expand electric power in Africa, along with trade and agricultural initiatives. He also got the chance, which he didn't avail himself of during his first term, to celebrate his personal ties to Africa.

From ""welcome home"" signs in Senegal to Archbishop Desmond Tutu's challenge to him in South Africa to be a peacemaker, to the Tanzanians' renaming a road in their capital as Barack Obama Drive, each stop on Obama's three-country trip highlighted Africa's expression of ownership and expectations for the son of a Kenyan who became the first black U.S. president.",02/07/2013

Antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV should begin sooner than it does now, according to new guidelines released Sunday by the World Health Organization.

Treatment should begin as soon as a patient's CD4 count drops below 500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, compared with the previous count of 350, The New York Times reported. CD4s are immune system cells that are attacked by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

The WHO said some people should begin antiretroviral therapy as soon as they test positive for HIV, regardless of CD4 count. This includes patients with active tuberculosis or hepatitis B liver disease, women who are pregnant or breast feeding, children under age 5, and people whose regular sex partners are not infected.

Hobby Lobby and the Mardel Christian bookstore chain will not have to pay $1.3 million in daily fines for refusing to provide employees with access to certain forms of birth control.

U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton made the ruling Friday and set a court date of July 19 to hear claims by the companies' owners that having to provide every form of birth control through workers' health care plans would violate their religious beliefs, the Associated Press reported.

The owners object to birth control methods meant to prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, such as the morning-after pill or an intrauterine device. However, they are willing to provide employees' with access to 16 other forms of birth control mentioned in the federal health care law.

Heaton said that between now and the hearing, the government cannot impose fines against the companies for failing to comply with the Affordable Care Act, the AP report.

The outbreak has sickened 127 people in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wisconsin and was linked to a frozen food blend called Townsend Farms and Harris Tweeter Organic Antioxidant Blends.

An investigation into the outbreak concluded that the most likely source of the hepatitis A was a shipment of pomegranate seeds used in the frozen food products. The shipment of pomegranate seeds came from Foodstuffs Import Export Trading of Turkey, the FDA said.

The agency said it's working with companies that have distributed pomegranate seeds from this shipment to help ensure that all recipients of these seeds are notified.

First Non-Hormonal Treatment for Hot Flashes Approved by FDA

The first non-hormonal treatment for menopause-associated hot flashes has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The agency approved Brisdelle to treat moderate to severe hot flashes. The new drug contains paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant sold under the brand names Paxil and Pexeva. Brisdelle is taken once daily at bedtime.

There are a number of FDA-approved treatments for hot flashes, but all contain either estrogen alone or estrogen plus a progestin. Approval of Brisdelle was based on two clinical trials that included a total of 1,175 postmenopausal women and found that Brisdelle was more effective than a placebo at reducing hot flashes. Common side effects included headache, fatigue and nausea/vomiting.

Paxil and Pexeva carry a warning about an increased risk of suicide in children and young adults. Because Brisdelle contains the same active ingredient as those drugs, a warning about suicide risk is included on the new drug's label.

Brisdelle's label also warns about a possible reduction in the effectiveness of tamoxifen if both medications are used together, and an increased risk of bleeding.

Menopause-associated hot flashes occur in up to 75 percent of women and can persist for five years or longer. While not life-threatening, hot flashes can cause discomfort, embarrassment and sleep disruption.

""There are a significant number of women who suffer from hot flashes associated with menopause and who cannot or do not want to use hormonal treatments,"" Dr. Hylton Joffe, director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in an agency news release.

Brisdelle is marketed by Noven Therapeutics, LLC. of Miami, Fla.",01/07/2013
NewsDay,New guidelines advise earlier AIDS treatment,"LONDON - Young children and certain other people with the AIDS virus should be started on medicines as soon as they are diagnosed, the World Health Organization says in new guidelines that also recommend earlier treatment for adults.

The advice will have the most impact in Africa, where nearly 70 percent of people with HIV live. Many rich countries already advocate early treatment. WHO's new guidelines were released yesterday at the International AIDS Society meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

About 34 million people worldwide have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV attacks key infection-fighting cells known as T-cells. When that count drops to 200, people are considered to have AIDS. In the past, WHO recommended treating people with HIV when their T-cell count fell to 350; a normal count is between 500 and 1,600.

The new recommendations say to treat earlier, when the T-cell count hits 500.

In addition to children under 5, WHO says, several other groups should get AIDS drugs as soon as they're diagnosed with HIV: pregnant and breast-feeding women, people whose partners are uninfected and those who also have tuberculosis or hepatitis B.",30/06/2013
NewsDay,Plan B Contraceptive Approved for All Females of Childbearing Age,"The Plan B ""emergency"" contraceptive (levonorgestrel) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any female of child-bearing potential.

Thursday's agency announcement followed an April ruling by the U.S. District Court in New York that the product had to be made available without restriction, including age.

Plan B is meant to reduce the chances of pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex or suspected contraceptive failure. The product was first approved in 2009 as an over-the-counter option for women 17 and older, and as a prescription option for younger females.

The product will not end the pregnancy of a female who is already pregnant, and there is no evidence that it will harm a developing fetus, the FDA said in a news release. It will not prevent any sexually transmitted disease, including HIV/AIDS, the agency added.

Some females who have taken Plan B have reported these side effects: nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, headache, dizziness and breast tenderness. These adverse reactions are similar to those reported after use of other birth control products, the FDA said.

Plan B is produced by Teva Women's Health, a unit of the Israeli drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.

NewsDay,High court nixes anti-prostitution pledge,"WASHINGTON -- In a free-speech ruling, the Supreme Court said yesterday that the government cannot force private health organizations to denounce prostitution as a condition of getting taxpayer money to fight AIDS around the world.

Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court, said the anti-prostitution pledge in a 2003 AIDS funding law improperly restricts the groups' U.S. constitutional rights.

Four organizations that work in Africa, Asia and South America challenged the provision in the law, arguing their work has nothing to do with prostitution.

The Obama administration had countered that it is reasonable for the government to give money only to groups that oppose prostitution and sex trafficking because those activities contribute to the spread of HIV and AIDS. It said that if groups were not required, they could spend private funds in a way that might undermine the government's mission.

In the 6-2 decision, Roberts wrote that requiring the pledge ""requires them to pledge allegiance to the government's policy of eradicating prostitution."" That, the government cannot do, he wrote.

Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented.

The AIDS funding case was one of three decided yesterday.

NewsDay,"'Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead' filmmaker to speak in East Hampton","At 40, Joe Cross, was 100 pounds overweight, overindulgent and suffering from an autoimmune disease called urticaria, which caused painful hivelike breakouts all over his skin.

Committed to making a change, the Australia native turned to a juice fast. For 60 days, he consumed only fruit and vegetable juices and traveled across the United States documenting his journey while doing it. Along the way, he dropped the extra weight, gained clarity and saw a complete loss of his urticaria symptoms, he said.

After “Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead” was released in 2010, Cross founded Reboot with Joe, a health and lifestyle brand that provides information and support to people looking to make diet and lifestyle changes.

On Saturday, Cross will be the guest of honor at the East Hampton Wellness Foundation’s annual Summer Benefit. The Wellness Foundation is a community organization founded in 2005 to provide community support for those interested in moving to a plant-based diet and healthier lifestyle.

We caught up with Cross via email (he was traveling in Southeast Asia this week) about his lifestyle changes, the benefit of juicing and his advice for others:

Can you give our readers a quick idea of what your lifestyle was like before you turned to juicing?

I reckon I was the poster boy for excess — if I liked something, I couldn’t get enough of it. I lived on pizza, hamburgers, fast food of all kinds, tons of sugary soda, and all consumed quickly and with almost no impulse control. And as with so many people, it including smoking and drinking, too.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

How soon after you started the juice fast did you start noticing differences in your body and overall health?

Well, the first three to five days, I felt like a truck hit me — and then reversed back over me again! My body was detoxing from years of sugar, chemicals, caffeine and processed food and let me tell you, it wasn’t happy about it. But after five days of just consuming fresh fruit and vegetable juice, I started to feel really well. In fact, better than I had in years. I had a kind of mental clarity and calm that I hadn’t experienced before. The whites of my eyes brightened up, the weight started falling away and I had this new level of energy that was exhilarating. I call it Human 2.0.

Had you tried other diet changes before and why did you commit to a juice diet?

I had tried everything, but only in fits and starts. I think I was able to commit to juicing because of its efficiency. There was no gray area and, in order to change my behavior I really needed that clarity. Also, my experiment was really about reclaiming my health and not just about weight loss. I wanted to test the theory that Mother Nature would do her job beautifully if I just got out of her way. Juicing was the easiest and fastest way to do that since all you are doing is consuming what I call liquid sunshine.

If the body can heal itself, why can’t it do so on the standard American diet?

Well, the standard American diet of processed food, animal foods and a meager 5 percent allocated to fruits and vegetables means that we’re both overfed and often nutrient challenged. Plus, much of what we consume is the problem — and it would be hard to heal from anything if you were reinjuring yourself three times a day.

Since releasing the film “Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead,” you’ve continued to travel around the world to promote juicing and I understand you’re working on a second film. In all your interactions, what has been the most surprising thing you’ve come across?

People’s desire to change, and the importance of community as they make those changes. The most gratifying aspect of what I’ve been able to do at www.rebootwithjoe.com is create a community of hundreds of thousands of people who are supporting each other and making those behavioral shifts possible.

Look, people aren’t dumb. We know that much of what we eat isn’t good for us. I’ve never met an overweight person who looks in the mirror and doesn’t realize there’s a problem. What people need is a clear path to follow, and the help of some like-minded souls. With that, amazing things are possible.

What is the single best change a person could make to start improving their health today?

It’s so simple. Get more fresh fruits and vegetables any way you can. I happen to believe juicing is a powerful, fast and easy way to do that. If you look at the 2 to 3 pounds of produce that go into a juice, you can’t imagine eating it. But by juicing it, you are getting all of those amazing nutrients, enzymes and phytochemicals quickly and easily. And over time if you do something as simple as add one juice per day, you will start to see a difference in how you feel — and nothing motivates as well as results!

Tell me about your diet today. All juice all the time?

My diet is about 80 percent plant-based, with tons of vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and seeds; some whole grain; and sometimes a bit of animal protein. I do indeed have one (if not more) juices a day, and my favorite it still my Mean Green Juice. But that leaves enough room for me to indulge when the occasion or mood suits me. So yes, there’s turkey and potatoes at Thanksgiving, and birthday cake at a party.

What is the status of your illness now?

Happily, I haven’t had a reoccurrence of my illness since I did the reboot chronicled in the film. And I’m still medication free.

A juice fast seems pretty straightforward, but is there a way to do it wrong?

Getting more vegetables and fruits into your diet is always a great idea, but if you are going to do a Reboot, we recommend that your juices are comprised of about 80 percent vegetables, 20 percent fruit to make sure you’re not getting too much sugar into your system.

NewsDay,Study: Wiser medication use may cut health care costs,"If doctors and patients used prescription drugs more wisely, it could save the U.S. health care system about $213 billion a year, by reducing medication overuse, underuse and other flaws in care that cause complications and longer, more-expensive treatments, researchers conclude.

The new findings by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics improve on numerous prior efforts to quantify the dollars wasted on health care.

Numerous experts have estimated tens of billions, perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars, could be better used each year to improve patient care and outcomes and to slow down spending by government health programs, insurers and consumers.

The institute, part of data analysis and consulting firm IMS Health, used proprietary data on prescriptions written by doctors -- many of which patients never fill -- plus other information to produce a current, more reliable estimate of avoidable costs solely related to medication use.

IMS arrived at the $213 billion figure based on six categories in which doctors, patients or both could be making better use of medication, from getting a prompt diagnosis when new symptoms arise to taking medicines as directed by the doctor.

Across the six categories, the researchers generally focused on spending on a handful of very common or very expensive diseases -- from high cholesterol and blood pressure to HIV and diabetes -- for which costs of care and complications are well documented.

""There's even larger avoidable costs if we were to look at all disease areas"" where patients aren't getting optimal care, Murray Aitken, the institute's executive director, told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview. ""There's a big opportunity for improvement.""

The $213 billion equals nearly 8 percent of the more than $2.7 trillion the U.S. spent on health care last year -- billions that could pay health care costs for more than 24 million uninsured Americans, according to IMS.",19/06/2013

The percentage of current smoking adults has seen a noticable decrease over 15 years, with 24.7 percent of adults counted as smokers in 1997.

The report also broke down the numbers by sex. In 2012, 20.4 percent of men described themselves as smokers, while 15.8 percent of women said they regularly lit up.

The number of current smokers was lowest among men and women 65 and over, while those in the 18-44 age bracket had the highest percentage of any age group at 20.3.

Still, more deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle accidents, suicides and murders combined, according to the CDC's website.

In an effort to combat these statistics, the CDC recently released the second part of a vast anti-smoking campaign that included a series of video tips from former smokers.

NewsDay,Many Young Americans Unaware They're Infected With HIV,"The younger you are, the less likely you are to realize you are infected with HIV or receive treatment for it, a new study finds.

Early diagnosis, prompt and continued care, and antiretroviral drug therapy are key to lowering the risk of illness and death among patients, and reducing transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

However, this study of 2009 data from the National HIV Surveillance System found that people under the age of 45 who are infected with the virus are much less likely than their older peers to know they are infected or to be getting proper care.

The study also revealed that more than 200,000 of the more than 1.1 million Americans who are infected are unaware they carry the virus. The investigators also found that only about 37 percent of infected people received regular care, only one-third were prescribed HIV-suppressing medicines, and 25 percent had achieved a ""suppressed viral load,"" meaning HIV was being kept to very low levels.

These results varied widely by age. For example, among HIV-infected people aged 13 to 24, only about 40 percent had received a diagnosis of HIV infection and only 30 percent had been referred for care.

Lower percentages of people aged 25 to 44 received regular care, were prescribed drug therapy and had a suppressed viral load, compared with those aged 55 to 64, the study found. For example, 28 percent of young adults with HIV were receiving treatment, compared with 46 percent of those aged 55 to 64.

The study was published online June 17 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

Overall, more than 850,000 Americans with HIV had not achieved the treatment goal of viral suppression. This included 75 percent of men with HIV, 79 percent of blacks, 74 percent of Hispanics, and 70 percent of whites.

""Individuals, health care providers, health departments and government agencies must all work together to increase the numbers of people living with HIV who are aware of their status, linked to and retained in care, receiving treatment and adherent to treatment,"" concluded researchers led by H. Irene Hall of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""In 2011, the HIV field was shocked to learn that only about a quarter of individuals living with HIV were successfully receiving HIV treatment,"" Drs. Katerina Christopoulos and Diane Havlir, of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an accompanying commentary.

""The sobering numbers of those missing out on effective treatment because they did not know they were infected and those who knew their status but did not seek care spurred collaboration between the HIV treatment and prevention movements, two areas with different funding streams that often operated independently of one another,"" they noted.

""Already the HIV community has mobilized to further develop and study interventions that address bottlenecks in the cascade. Achieving an AIDS-free generation will be within reach if, and only if, these efforts succeed,"" Christopoulos and Havlir concluded.

NewsDay,Endoscopes Not Always Cleaned Properly: Study,"Three of every 20 flexible endoscopes used to examine patients' gastrointestinal tracts and colons were improperly cleaned, a new study finds.

Those 15 percent of endoscopes had unacceptable levels of ""bio dirt"" -- cells and matter from a patient's body that could pose a potential infection risk to other patients, according to the researchers.

They examined 275 flexible duodenoscopes, gastroscopes, and colonoscopes used at five U.S. hospitals and found that 30 percent, 24 percent and 3 percent, respectively, did not pass a cleanliness rating.

The study findings were to be presented last weekend at the annual meeting of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC).

""Three out of 20 is an unexpectedly high number of endoscopes failing a cleanliness criterion,"" lead investigator Marco Bommarito, lead research specialist at 3M Infection Prevention Division, said in an APIC news release. ""Clearly, we'd like no endoscopes to fail a cleanliness rating.""

In recent years, improperly cleaned endoscopes at medical facilities in the United States have resulted in thousands of patients having to be checked for HIV and hepatitis B and C, according to the news release. More health-care-associated outbreaks have been linked to contaminated endoscopes than to any other medical device, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported.

Each year in the United States, between 15 million and 20 million endoscopy procedures are conducted with reusable endoscope devices to screen various parts of patients' gastrointestinal tracts and look for problems such as cancer.

Duodenoscopes examine the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine), while gastroscopes examine the stomach and colonoscopes examine the colon.

""The cleaning protocols for flexible endoscopes need improvement, such as guidelines tailored to the type of scope or identifying if there is a critical step missing in the manual cleaning process, and documented quality-control measures,"" Bommarito said. ""These types of improvements could have a positive impact on patient safety.""

Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

NewsDay,AIDS pill may help protect IV drug users,"ATLANTA -- Doctors should consider giving a daily AIDS drug to another high risk group to help prevent infections -- people who inject heroin, methamphetamines or other drugs, U.S. health officials said yesterday.

A similar recommendation is already in place for gay men and heterosexual couples at high risk of catching HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

The latest advice was triggered by the results of a study done in Thailand that showed the AIDS drug tenofovir protected many drug users. Volunteers who took the daily pill were about 50 percent less likely to become infected than those given a dummy pill.

The research by the CDC and the Thailand government was published online yesterday by the journal Lancet.

Based on the findings, the CDC recommended that doctors consider prescribing tenofovir to those who inject drugs. It blocks the virus from making copies and spreading through the body. In the United States, tenofovir is included in an AIDS drug called Truvada.

HIV infections in drug users worldwide account for about 1 in 10 new cases each year and the vast majority of infections in some places in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In the United States, they represent about 1 in 13 new cases.

People who inject drugs can spread the AIDS virus to others through sharing tainted needles or sex.

How many people already take the drug in America to protect against infection isn't known. And officials acknowledge it's not clear how many of the nation's 1 million injection drug users would have the money or insurance to pay for it.

NewsDay,Port Washington policeman Brian Staley earns historic promotion,"The magnitude of what Brian Staley was about to accomplish struck him as he pulled to the side of the road on 201st Street in St. Albans, Queens, on Wednesday. An African-American man who appeared to be down on his luck was collecting bottles, and Staley stopped to hand him his empty soda container.

“You look nice. Where are you going?” the man asked, noticing Staley’s police dress uniform.

“I’m getting promoted to police chief,” Staley, 62, responded.

At first, the man appeared to be shocked by the news that Staley, who is also African-American, would be receiving such a title. But as he processed the information, a big smile swept across his face.

Staley shared this story Monday with the roughly 200 people gathered at the Port Washington Fire Department to watch him being sworn in to the position of deputy chief of the Port Washington Police Department. At that moment, he became the first African-American in Port Washington’s history to earn the title.

“This is not just for me. A lot of people are celebrating this,” said Staley. “I’m very proud, but it’s actually a very humbling thing.”

For the past year, Staley, an Air Force veteran and a 31-year veteran of the Port Washington Police Department, has been serving as a lieutenant.

“He’s earned this promotion,” said acting Port Washington Police Chief Jim Salerno. “He’s an exceptional officer .?.?. and a very community-minded person.”

Staley is involved in several community organizations in Port Washington and throughout Nassau County. In conjunction with the Economic Opportunity Commission of Nassau County, he has worked on gang prevention, AIDS awareness, HIV prevention and voter education.

“He’s been very involved in the African-American and Hispanic communities here in Port Washington and for them to see this meant so much to him,” said his wife, Linda Staley, 62, of St. Albans.

As they watched their father make history, Staley’s three children — Ian, 37, Jamal, 41, and Lena, 20, all said they felt inspired.

“I couldn’t be prouder,” Lena Staley added. “He’s such a wonderful, and beautiful and intelligent man, and he makes everything around him just so beautiful.”

While he celebrated with his family and fellow officers, Staley did not want to spend much time discussing the discrimination lawsuit he filed against the Port Washington Police Department in the early 1990s. He said it was settled quickly out of court.

“Port Washington is an interesting community, not just the police district, in that it seems to correct itself,” he said. “If there are things that are wrong, eventually it’s corrected.”

According to Staley, Port Washington has had a number of female police officers and female members of the police commission that helps oversee the department.

“Port Washington has really been a maverick,” he said. “I don’t know whether it’s been by choice or accident.”

Staley hopes that his accomplishment inspires younger generations.

NewsDay,Medicine Might Help Shield Injection Drug Abusers From HIV,"An antiviral drug may help protect injection drug users from HIV infection, a new study finds.

The study of more than 2,400 injection drug users recruited at 17 drug treatment clinics in Thailand found that daily tablets of tenofovir reduced the risk of HIV infection by nearly 49 percent, compared to inactive placebo pills.

One expert said an intervention to help shield injection drug users from HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- is much needed.

""This is an important study that opens up an additional option for preventing HIV in a hard-to-reach population,"" said Dr. Joseph McGowan, medical director at the Center for AIDS Research & Treatment at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.

He noted that ""HIV infections continue to occur at high rates, with over 2.5 million worldwide and 50,000 new infections in the U.S. each year. This is despite widespread knowledge about HIV infection and the way it is spread, through unprotected sex and sharing needles for injecting drugs.""

The participants included in the new study were followed for an average of four years. During that time, 17 of the more than 1,200 patients taking tenofovir became infected with HIV, compared with 33 of an equal number of patients taking a placebo, according to the study published online June 12 in The Lancet.

Further analyses of the results showed that the protective effect of tenofovir was highest among those who most closely followed the drug's prescribed regimen. In this group, the risk of HIV infection was reduced by more than 70 percent, said study leaders Dr. Kachit Choopanya and Dr. Michael Martin, chief of clinical research for the Thailand Ministry of Public Health--U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration.

Prior research has shown that preventive use of antiviral drugs cuts the risk of sexual transmission of HIV in both heterosexual couples and men who have sex with men, and also reduces mother-to-child transmission of HIV. But this is the first study to show that this approach might also be effective among injection drug users.

Worldwide, injection drug use is believed to cause one in 10 new HIV infections. But rates of infection associated with injection drug use are far higher in some areas of the world, such as eastern Europe and central Asia. In these regions, up to 80 percent of new HIV infections are caused by injection drug use.

According to McGowan, tenofovir is no ""silver bullet"" that would, on its own, eliminate the risk of HIV infection for drug abusers. But it could be a key ingredient in reducing the odds.

""Adoption of this strategy, not as a stand-alone, but in conjunction with needle exchange, counseling, opiate substitution, social support and mental health therapy may enable us to get ahead of this expanding epidemic,"" McGowan said.

He added that the participants in the study were also provided with what's known as ""directly observed therapy,"" where the drug is administered under the observance of a health care worker. Services like this, along with monthly HIV testing and condom distribution, might not occur in ""real life"" treatment situations, McGowan said, so outcomes might not be as good as in this clinical trial.

Another expert agreed that adherence to tenofovir therapy is key to success.

Tenofovir ""accumulates slowly [in the body], making the case for adherence -- which is strongly associated with the efficacy of the drug,"" said Victoria Richards, assistant professor of medical sciences at the Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University, in Hamden, Conn.

China's Sichuan province is miles away from Long Island, but it's close to Brendan Liu's heart.

In May 2008, the province, the second most populous in China, was devastated by a magnitude 7.9 earthquake. At least 69,000 people were killed, and more than 18,000 were left missing. On a visit the next year, Liu saw two things that inspired in him a need to help that has had far-reaching

implications.

Liu took a 13-hour flight to visit his grandparents, who live in a small industrialized village in the Fujian province near the southeastern coast. When he walked into the bathroom and turned on the faucet, brown water filled the sink.

""I looked in disgust and confusion,"" said Liu, 17. ""It was one of the most life-changing events in my life. I realized we, as Americans, are fortunate to have clean water available to us, whereas my grandparents had to struggle.""

His grandparents explained that finding fresh water was difficult, and it was used sparingly for cooking and cleaning.

When he returned to Long Island, Liu, who is president of his school's environmental club, spent the next two years researching water purification at Stony Brook University, creating a novel membrane system that simultaneously filters and removes bacteria and heavy-metal particles from water. His work garnered national acclaim in the Siemens and International Sustainable World (Engineering, Energy & Environment) Project Olympiad (I-SWEEEP) competitions and won the $40,000 grand prize in the Lexus Eco Challenge for his high school.

Liu, who said he is looking forward to attending the University of California, Berkeley, where he will major in environmental engineering, recently started an initiative to recycle ink and printer cartridges in the school district.

In addition to his environmental efforts, Liu also wanted to help Sichuan's students, who saw many of their schools ruined in the earthquake. Inspired by helping his aunt collect and donate books for South African students diagnosed with HIV, Liu founded the nonprofit Pages4Life to donate books to Sichuan Elementary School.

To ""help the literacy rate of disenfranchised youths,"" Liu, who struggled to read as a child, asked local libraries and schools on Long Island for new or used books to donate. But the shipping expense was an obstacle.

That is until he entered into a partnership with a local shipping company to offset the international shipping fees. Liu's first shipment in 2011 totaled 548 books. In all, he said, he has sent about 2,000 books to the school.

Liu's charitable streak extends beyond Asia.

He's been swimming ""all my life,"" he said, and has been on the school swim team throughout high school. ""I like the competitive spirit and camaraderie.""

On Saturdays, as part of a school-sponsored program, he teaches youths how to swim. It's a paid position, but Liu forfeits the money -- about $200 a month -- so that needy children can get the lessons for free.

NewsDay,Can oral sex really give you cancer?,"Whether oral sex did cause Michael Douglas’ bout with cancer really doesn’t matter. What does matter are the questions and resulting conversations that came from his interview.

Before an overabundance of “Oral sex gave me cancer” headlines, the likelihood is that most HPV-related conversations focused on vaccines for young women. Instead, people are now left wondering, “Can doing that really lead to cancer?”

Well as it turns out, yes, it can. At least in some cases.

The Centers for Disease Control lists HPV as the most common sexually transmitted infection, with more than 40 types that affect both men and women’s genital areas. But while a person’s genitals may be the most commonly infected area of the body, the mouth and throat as areas susceptible to infection as well.

Although most people who contract HPV never develop any symptoms (with most cases clearing themselves up), there are rare cases in which the infection can lead to more serious conditions, including cancer.

Dr. Douglas Frank, chief of the division of head and neck surgery at Long Island Jewish Medical Center and director of head and neck surgical oncology at the North Shore LIJ Cancer Institute, said the number of people who will develop any form of cancer from HPV is very small.

“The vast majority of us are able to clear it, our immune systems just clear the virus,” Frank said. “There’s a small population of people that don’t clear it, and an even smaller population of those people that are susceptible to get the cancer from it.”

For those that reside within the smallest of those percentages, transmission is not necessarily as lewd as the headline writers might have you believe. “Probably, a certain component of it is oral sex,” confirmed Frank, “but another component is probably just kissing, like French kissing.”

Unlike other sexually transmitted infections, HPV can be transmitted through “relatively casual” sexual contact, he said. “It’s not like HIV where it has to be more explicit sexual contact, this is a little bit more casual,” said Frank, reiterating, “ .?.?. and the vast majority of us clear it.”

However, Frank did admit that the number of cases -- though small -- are growing, citing HPV as a contributing factor.

Though the risk of developing cancer from HPV is small, the risk of being exposed to HPV is great -- upward of 90% of the population, Frank said -- so it is still important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal cancer.

“You don’t have to be a big partyer or drinker or smoker to get it,” Frank said. “You could just be a regular American and in that 90-some-odd percent of the population that’s at least been exposed.”

Frank said signs of the disease include a lump in the neck that may not even cause pain in the throat. In other cases, where the tumor may be larger, patients will complain of a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, a change in the voice and even difficulty breathing.

What can be done to protect yourself?

Administering the Gardasil vaccine to adolescent boys as well as girls has become a popular prevention method because “the predominant population that’s getting HPV associated throat cancer are men,” Frank said.

He said that for the long term treatment of this infection, parents should vaccinate their children against HPV. In a statement on the CDC's website they say: Gardasil is recommended for 11- and 12 year-old girls, and also females 13 through 26-year-old who were not previously vaccinated. Gardasil is also recommended for 9- through 26- year-old males to protect against some genital warts.

For adults, however, Frank said there’s not much else to do but be self-aware and proactive about your health.

Ultimately, it comes down to simple prevention steps. “Women need to continue getting their Pap smears and men need to be on the lookout for a lump in the neck,” Frank said. “If the throat’s a little bit sore, even occasionally an ENT exam.”",06/06/2013
NewsDay,Pricey biologic drugs raise hopes - and questions,"Richard Hamablet of Levittown had suffered from prostate cancer for years until a vaccine quickly made the disease disappear.

The vaccine, which is called Provenge, isn't cheap and is actually so expensive that some doctors have refused to prescribe it.

""It's $33,000 per procedure and there are three of them,"" said Hamablet, 78, who was infused last year with the innovative vaccine, also known as a biologic medication.

The cancer, which had spread to his spine, vanished shortly after his third treatment.

Biologic drugs, so named because they are derived from proprietary biological processes, such as genetic engineering, or patients' own cells, are some of the most expensive medications on the market.

And they are increasingly becoming the types of medications that best treat a growing number of conditions -- rheumatoid arthritis, several forms of cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis, to name a few.

The questions vexing doctors and advocates are the stratospheric costs, the lack of price controls on U.S. pharmaceutical products and the growing number of new biologic drugs.

A group of 100 cancer doctors from nearly 20 countries recently wrote an editorial in the journal Blood labeling the cost of cancer medications unsustainable.

Referring to the 12 approved last year for a variety of different types of cancer, the doctors noted that 11 were priced above $100,000 -- all of them biologics.

In Europe, the doctors noted, universal health coverage ""shields patients from the direct economic anxieties of illness.""

But not so in the United States, where patients might pay an average of 20 percent of drug costs out-of-pocket.

Cancer isn't the only illness marked by the high costs of biologics.

Amy Melnick, vice president for advocacy at the Arthritis Foundation, said biologics designed for rheumatoid arthritis have been transformative for patients, but prices have been unbearable.

""Do I wish they cost less? Absolutely,"" Melnick said.

The most expensive biologic -- for a rare genetic condition -- costs as much as a house: $400,000 for a year of therapy.

Even though patents have expired on some biologics, experts say, there have been no price reductions.

The number of biologic medications is now growing at twice the rate of traditional medications, which are produced through chemical synthesis.

Some biologics cost 50 times the price of chemically synthesized drugs, studies show.

Claire Sheahan, spokeswoman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Corp. in Washington, said there are no generics for biologic medications.

Her organization's research indicates that if generic versions could be made of the few biologics with expired patents, medical expenses would decline by billions of dollars nationwide.

In New York alone, Sheahan's pharmaceutical group found that 689,870 prescriptions were written in 2011 for biologic therapies, the most recent year for complete statistics.

""There is a real moral issue here,"" said Dr. Brian Harper of the NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine in Woodbury.

""To some extent, health care is becoming a commodity where, basically, if you can afford it, then you can have it,"" Harper said. ""From my perspective as a physician, I feel a patient in need should have whatever medicine is required.""

Hamablet has thrived as a result of the Provenge therapy.

He was fortunate to be enrolled in Medicare, which paid for the treatment.

Without the federal insurance program for people 65 and older, Hamablet said he would have had to resort to drastic measures.

""I would have had to sell my house to afford it,"" the retired electrician said.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers Medicare, deemed Provenge vital to men's survival. The agency announced in July 2011 that full coverage would be available to recipients. The drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010.

Provenge is designed for men with advanced prostate cancer -- metastatic disease -- that has spread to other parts of the body and resists conventional treatment.

""Provenge is important to survival,"" said Dr. Jeff Vacirca, Hamablet's physician.

The vaccine is made from a patient's own dendritic cells, immune system components that are treated in a laboratory, that are then infused back into the patient as a vaccine.

In the lab, the cells are genetically engineered to recognize and destroy errant prostate cancer cells.

A product of Seattle-based Dendreon, a biotechnology company, the vaccine's $99,000 cost, Vacirca said, reflects both the sophisticated nature of the science that gave rise to it and the highly technical labor involved in manufacturing it.

Vacirca, a specialist in prostate cancer and chief of research at North Shore Hematology Oncology Associates in East Setauket, said he is well aware that some doctors have not prescribed Provenge because of the expense.

He defends the $99,000 expense for the three-dose therapy, noting Provenge's cost is concentrated in a four- to six-week period.

Standard chemotherapy costs about the same, Vacirca said, but is spread over one to two years, which makes the cost seem lower.",05/06/2013
NewsDay,Letter: Colleges paranoid over sex speech,"As a former U.S. Education Department lawyer, I largely agree with Cathy Young's criticism of the department for demanding that colleges treat as ""sexual harassment"" any ""unwelcome"" sexual speech, even if it would not offend a ""reasonable person"" [""Yet another governmental overreach,"" Opinion, May 28].

That would treat even a professor who appropriately discusses sexual topics -- like how HIV is transmitted -- as a harasser if a single student finds the topic ""unwelcome."" That would violate court rulings such as DeJohn v. Temple University (2008), which ruled that speech on sexual topics is protected by the First Amendment even if it is unwelcome to some listeners, and cannot be banned as harassment.

However, the Education Department did not say, as Young writes, that all unwelcome sexual conduct is actionable, i.e., the basis for a lawsuit. Rather, it said that broad definition of harassment should be used in college discipline. It admitted that a narrower definition applies in lawsuits.

NewsDay,"Joe Girardi and Terry Collins: Pair of New York managers with different expectations, results","They share the same job title, and both are employed in New York. But for Terry Collins and Joe Girardi, the similarities pretty much end there.

Well, except for one other common thread: contracts that expire at the end of this season, and not much in the way of assurances they will be renewed.

The question popped up occasionally for Collins during spring training, and he always insisted that he's at peace with his lame-duck status. But it's unclear exactly what Collins needs to do to be asked back.

For most managers, the mission statement is easy to understand. Stay in contention, finish with a winning record, maybe even get to the playoffs. But those goals already seem unrealistic with a deeply flawed Mets team that is constantly looking forward to the players it doesn't have -- Zack Wheeler, Travis d'Arnaud -- for daily affirmation.

Unfortunately for Collins, he's stuck in the dim reality of the present, trying to stay afloat in five-day increments until Matt Harvey's next start. That was hard enough before the whole Jordany Valdespin affair, a flat-out stupid mess that Collins made worse by accidentally kicking a buzzing hive of the team's fans.

From there, it was only natural to begin drawing parallels with Collins' temperamental flame-outs with the Astros and Angels. But this was different, and for a manager who's been swimming upstream in Flushing since 2011, Collins reacted smartly to prevent himself from drowning. Also, the front office didn't take the bait.

At the time of the Valdespin affair, the Mets were in the process of piling up 14 losses in 18 games. And once the fans got on his back -- unfair or not -- Collins probably was at the most vulnerable point of his tenure with the Mets.

Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But general manager Sandy Alderson, who hired Collins a month after taking the job, said he was satisfied with the manager's navigation of the volatile incident, from the moment Valdespin was drilled May 11 at Citi Field to the extended fallout that stretched into midweek.

""From my standpoint, I have no problem whatsoever with how he handled things,"" Alderson said before adding that Collins did nothing more serious than ""misspeak"" when he mentioned the fans.

Alderson may have hired Collins, but the two are not attached at the hip. Back in 2010, Alderson picked him over Bob Melvin, who went on to win Manager of the Year honors last season with the A's, and it's not as though the pair would go down together if the Mets resemble the walking dead by August and Citi Field is a ghost town.

That's because Alderson is signed through 2014 -- he also has option years attached to his current deal -- so this GM is not going anywhere before then, unless he wants out. It's a safe bet the Mets have no intention of paying anyone significant money to manage the team in 2014, and if for some reason Collins falls out of favor, the top two candidates look like bench coach Bob Geren and Triple-A manager Wally Backman.

A big second half obviously would give Collins an edge, but short of that, the odds certainly are against him. Even with 122 games left, it feels as though time is running out.

Across town, Girardi's situation is somewhat easier to quantify. Success with the Yankees is measured in World Series rings, and they haven't been to the Fall Classic since 2009, when they won No. 27 and Girardi later got a new number himself.

Getting swept by the Tigers last October, even in a postseason swallowed by A-Rod drama and Derek Jeter's broken ankle, clearly did not sit well with the higher-ups. And when the Yankees' idea of reloading in the offseason focused on bringing back the same group -- minus Nick Swisher -- it began to seem as though Girardi would be ushering a too-old, too-expensive team to also-ran status on the his own way out the door.

Then a funny thing happened. As the injury count skyrocketed, so did Girardi's street cred. Long criticized for his micro-managing tendencies, Girardi -- helped by the masterful roster puppetry of general manager Brian Cashman -- has mixed and matched the beaten-up Yankees to a 27-16 start that no one could have predicted. Not with 13 players already having spent time on the disabled list since Opening Day, and 11 still there.

Shorthanded doesn't begin to describe the Yankees' predicament. Nevertheless, they stand in first place, thanks to superb starting pitching, an airtight bullpen and just enough from a patchwork lineup that entered Saturday an un-Yankee-like ninth in the AL with 172 runs scored (4.1 average). The Tigers are No. 1 with 210 runs for a 5.4 average.

But can the Yankees sustain it? And is it Girardi's fault if they don't? They did the unthinkable after the 2007 season by parting ways with Joe Torre -- making him an offer the Yankees knew he could refuse -- and Girardi also will have to wait until after this season's final out to learn his fate.

Hal Steinbrenner made that clear Thursday after attending the MLB owners' meetings. Still, he praised Girardi's work to this point.

""We have to focus on our job right now,"" Steinbrenner said. ""There's a long road ahead, and that's not going to surprise Joe to hear me say that. He knows that. We're going to sit down and figure out what to do when this season ends, hopefully the beginning of November.""

Steinbrenner was alluding to another World Series trip for the Yankees, which would have to lead to an extension for Girardi. But as difficult as that is, it won't be as simple for Collins, who deserves to play this season with a handicap calculated in games below .500. After developing a culture of increasingly low expectations, the Mets would be hypocritical to fire Collins for merely living up to them.",18/05/2013
NewsDay,Promise to friend keeps Merrick woman walking for AIDS,"While purchasing a new mattress at a local Sleepy’s store earlier this year, Francine Goldstein asked the salesperson to write her a check.

Goldstein, 67, of Merrick, has made similar requests to car dealers, politicians, her doctors, co-workers, friends and family during the past 25 years in her quest to raise money for organizations that support people with AIDS.

“I’m not ashamed to ask for money, especially for a cause close to my heart,” said Goldstein, who will be participating in her 25th AIDS Walk New York on Sunday in Manhattan.

Goldstein has been walking in the event every year since 1988, when one of her very close friends was diagnosed with AIDS. In her first year, her only donors were her husband, Lenny Goldstein, and her dogs, Dana and Buddy, who together contributed $150 to the cause.

Since then, she’s raised more than $390,000 by soliciting donations from practically everyone she meets. (She usually never leaves the house without a stack of letters in her purse that explains her cause and how people can support it.)

In recent years, Goldstein’s efforts have repeatedly earned her a spot among the top fundraisers. Out of the roughly 45,000 walkers who took part in the 2012 event, Goldstein was the fourth highest fundraiser and had recruited the most individual donors, more than 370, according to Shona Borevitz, event director for AIDS Walk New York.

“She’s probably the most committed walker out of all 45,000 of them,” said Borevitz, 36. “She’s just incredible.”

Goldstein’s commitment to the event stems from a promise she made 25 years ago to her friend. There were very few services available to people with AIDS when her friend was diagnosed, but Goldstein worked to ensure she received medical, legal, financial and child care services, and access to support groups. Her friend lived two-and-a-half years with the disease before she died in 1991 at the age of 36, leaving behind a 2-year-old daughter, who, Goldstein said, is HIV negative.

“I saw her every week until she died, and I told her we would make sure no one suffered like she did,” Goldstein said. “I’ve kept that promise.”

Through the money Goldstein has raised and the millions AIDS Walk New York brings in each year, Gay Men’s Health Crisis and more than 45 smaller groups throughout the Tri-State area have been providing a range of services to people affected by AIDS, especially those living under the poverty level. These organizations help them receive medical treatment, housing assistance, hot meals and counseling.

“In the early years, GMHC was principally about helping people die with dignity, but these days -- thanks in large part to efforts like AIDS Walk New York -- it’s more about helping people survive and thrive,” said Craig Miller, the founder and senior organizer of the event.

Miller has donated to Goldstein’s fundraising efforts for many years. Among her other regular supporters is Dr. Michael Stocker, a former CEO of BlueCross BlueShield, the company she worked for until her retirement four years ago.

By Saturday morning, Goldstein had raised more than $31,000 through her fundraising page. She has until June 14 to collect donations, and is expecting that check from the Sleepy’s salesman to arrive this week.

As she walks the 6.2-mile course, which starts and ends in Central Park, Goldstein said she feels inspired by all the people, especially the younger ones, who have taken up the cause, too. She also thinks about her dear friend.

“I think she’d be very happy that we’ve come a long way and that I’m still keeping my promise,” she said. “I know we’re still far from a cure, but I feel one day there will be one.”",18/05/2013
NewsDay,UN marks International day Against Homophobia,"UNITED NATIONS -- The UN commemorated the International Day Against Homophobia on Friday, saying lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are entitled to protection by governments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

""I am outraged that we still have to fight prejudice, stigma, discrimination, exclusion, criminalization of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, not only in their homes, but in their streets, police stations and court rooms,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, at a news conference in New York.

""It is unacceptable that only one in 10 gay men have access to lifesaving HIV services. HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is 19 times higher than in the general population,"" he continued. ""If we are going to end AIDS we need the LGBT community more than ever.""

Sidibe spoke a day after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay delivered UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's message at the International Forum on the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, in The Hague, the Netherlands.

""The fight against homophobia is a core part of the broader battle for human rights for all,"" Ban's statement said. ""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights promises a world that is free and equal, and we will only honor that promise if everyone -- without exception -- enjoys the protection they deserve.""

The Declaration's preamble proclaims that ""recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."" Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, the document was drafted with the assistance of former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

Sidibe said that as many as 76 countries have laws on the books that outlaw same-sex relationships.

""We know what needs to be done,"" Ban continued. ""Draconian laws used to criminalize and punish LGBT people must be replaced by new laws that are in harmony with universal human rights conventions and protect everyone from discrimination on grounds of their sexual orientation and gender identity.""

NewsDay,"HIV No Barrier to Getting Liver Transplant, Study Finds","Liver transplants to treat a common type of liver cancer are a viable option for people infected with HIV, according to new research.

The Italian study, published May 10 in the journal The Oncologist, found that the AIDS-causing virus doesn't affect survival rates and cancer recurrence after transplants among HIV patients with this particular type of liver cancer, called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study's authors noted, however, that HCC is more aggressive in people with HIV and it is becoming a major cause of death among these patients as antiretroviral treatment prolongs their lives.

""The key message of this study is that liver transplantation is a valid option for HCC treatment in HIV-infected patients,"" the study's authors wrote in a journal news release. ""We suggest that HIV-infected patients must be offered the same liver transplant options for HCC treatment currently provided to HIV-uninfected subjects.""

The study involved 30 HIV-positive patients and 125 patients not infected with HIV who received a liver transplant to treat HCC at three different hospitals in northern Italy between 2004 and 2009.

During a follow-up period of roughly 32 months, the researchers found a recurrence of HCC in 6.7 percent of the patients with HIV and 14.4 percent of the patients who were not HIV positive.

The study also revealed that survival was similar for all of the patients one year after surgery and three years post-surgery.

The researchers, led by Dr. Fabrizio Di Benedetto, associate professor of surgery at the University of Modena, said the HIV-positive patients were treated with antiretroviral therapy until they underwent the transplant. The therapy was not resumed until their liver function stabilized after surgery.

None of the HIV-positive patients developed AIDS during the post-surgery follow-up period. The study's authors suggested that this may be due to timely resumption of HIV therapy following the liver transplant.

New options in antiviral therapy for people with HIV could improve control of the HIV virus as well as outcomes following liver transplant for HCC, the researchers said.

Patients with HIV undergoing liver transplant for HCC would benefit most from a multidisciplinary approach to care, the study authors said, which would involve collaboration among oncologists, radiologists, gastroenterologists, liver surgeons and infectious disease specialists.

NewsDay,Nancy Pelosi to attend LIGALY gala Friday in Old Bethpage,"U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will be among several hundred people celebrating 20 years of advocacy of the nonprofit Long Island Gay and Lesbian Youth at its annual gala on Friday.

The group, also known as LIGALY, has established community centers that serve as gathering places and resources for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth in Bay Shore and Garden City. It’s also been behind an innovative approach to gain visibility for the community and to increase parent and school involvement in protecting the rights of gay and lesbian youth.

Among advocacy initiatives that attracted headlines were organizing the first suburban gay prom in 2001 and establishing last year the first gay parent-teacher association in the state and the only one in the nation.

That work has boosted visibility for the community and the organization, said chief executive David Kilmnick, leading to Pelosi’s visit as celebrity guest. The Democratic Party leader from San Francisco is a known supporter of GLBT rights and funding for HIV/AIDS treatment.

“Long Island traditionally has been forgotten when it comes to many social justice issues,” Kilmnick said. “We need to be more vigilant and more visible to bring the resources to our region.”

Funds raised from event sponsorship and tickets to the gala will support the purchase of a passenger van to transport youth to the group’s centers and activities. The gala, which starts at 6 p.m., will take place at Carlyle on the Green at Bethpage State Park.",09/05/2013
NewsDay,Nassau disallows condoms as prostitution evidence because of health concerns,"Condoms are no longer being used as evidence in Nassau County prostitution cases -- a move intended to help prevent the spread of disease among sex workers.

The policy change was quietly put into effect last fall by District Attorney Kathleen Rice and has since drawn praise from public health groups.

Rice's office, which says its ability to prosecute the cases isn't compromised, is believed to be the first in New York to make the change.

""We're trying to increase the probability that sex workers will engage in protected sex,"" Rice said, noting that many sex workers are themselves victims of sex trafficking and violence. ""The public health issue outweighs the public safety issue.""

Madeline Singas, Rice's chief assistant, outlined the change in tactics in a one-page memo to prosecutors in October. Since then, word has trickled out to police, defense lawyers, and legal and justice officials statewide.

""If this is going to take away fear of sex workers using condoms, then we totally support her,"" said Catherine Hart, chief operating officer at the Long Island Association for AIDS Care.

The number of prostitution arrests annually has fluctuated widely in Nassau and Suffolk counties over the last decade. It was relatively low last year in both counties, with 26 cases resolved in Nassau and 51 in Suffolk, according to the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.

Still, Long Island law enforcement officials have made several high-profile busts in recent months, with police arresting individuals on prostitution charges and also groups of women accused of prostituting themselves out of illegal massage parlors.

In those cases, police have traditionally used condoms as evidence to support their arrests and have often seized condoms when they find suspected prostitutes with them.

Rice said she rethought her office's policy last year after reading a Human Rights Watch report that found that many prostitutes do not carry or use condoms because police often search for them and use them to make their cases.

A separate report by the Manhattan-based Urban Justice Center's Sex Workers Project relied in part on a 2010 survey of sex workers by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The report found that 57 percent of sex workers interviewed had condoms taken from them by a police officer, and 50 percent of those engaged in sex work afterward without a condom.

Sienna Baskin, co-director of the Sex Workers Project, said Rice's directive is a good start, but that more sweeping change is needed.

Her organization backs a bill that has been introduced in the State Legislature that would prohibit the use of condoms as evidence at trial and other legal proceedings.

The bill has been introduced twice in previous years, but Baskin, who traveled to Albany with dozens of others to lobby for it last week, said she hopes the new research on the subject will sway lawmakers this time.

Insp. Kenneth Lack, a Nassau police spokesman, declined to comment on Rice's policy.

In Suffolk, Deputy Police Chief Kevin Fallon said police seize condoms in some cases, such as illegal massage parlors. Condoms, along with the testimony of undercover officers and surveillance, are evidence of prostitution.

""If and when condoms are recovered by the police, their use at trial will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis,"" said Robert Clifford, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota.

Lawyers and law enforcement officials in both Nassau and Suffolk point out that prostitution cases seldom go to trial, and even when they do, condoms are seldom central to making a case.

Kent Moston, who heads Nassau's Legal Aid Society, called Rice's policy change ""intelligent and progressive,"" and likened it to a law passed in 2000 that aimed to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS by making it legal to possess and sell hypodermic needles without a prescription.

Rice, who becomes president of the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York in July, hopes to convince counterparts elsewhere to follow her lead. ""I'm confident that it won't be too long until our view is the standard, best practice in New York,"" she said.",05/05/2013
NewsDay,Former Indiana Gov. Otis R. Bowen dead at 95,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Otis R. Bowen, who overhauled Indiana's tax system as governor before helping oversee the federal response to the burgeoning AIDS epidemic during President Ronald Reagan's second term, has died. He was 95.

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement Sunday that Bowen died Saturday at a nursing home in Donaldson, a community about 25 miles south of South Bend that is near Bowen's hometown of Bremen. He didn't disclose the cause of death.

""Governor Otis R. Bowen's contributions to the life of this state and nation are incalculable, and I mark his passing with a sense of personal loss. His story is as inspiring as it is uniquely Hoosier,"" Pence said.

Bowen, who was affectionately known as ""Doc"" for his pre-public service life as a family doctor in Bremen, was first elected to office in 1952 as Marshall County's coroner. His political rise would eventually lead to the governor's office, which he held from 1973 until 1981.

In December 1985, with the Reagan administration facing criticism over its response to the AIDS epidemic, Bowen was appointed to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

In that role, Bowen stressed educating the public about the dangers of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Among his efforts was a mailing to 107 million households that he and Surgeon General C. Everett Koop arranged that offered advice about how to avoid contracting HIV, the precursor to AIDS, including the use of condoms.

Bowen was born Feb. 26, 1918, near the northern Indiana town of Rochester. He received bachelor's and medical degrees from Indiana University and joined the Army Medical Corps in 1943. His World War II service included going ashore with the first waves of Allied troops during the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.

Following the war, Bowen started a family medical practice in Bremen, a small town about 20 miles south of South Bend, which he continued for 25 years.

NewsDay,7 community events to attend this weekend,"Hundreds to help clean neighborhoods

Volunteers will hit the streets of Brentwood and Central Islip on Saturday for the third annual Clean Streets Committee cleanup, which this year will encompass both communities in one day.

Renee Ortiz, a Central Islip activist and one of the event organizers, said they expect to clean up at least 3 tons of garbage this weekend with roughly 300 volunteers. The group will meet at 8 a.m. outside the Applebee’s at 300 Motor Pkwy. in Brentwood; breakfast and lunch for volunteers will be donated by Applebee’s, Ortiz said.

Last year, she said, the group removed 3 tons of garbage from Brentwood and 2 tons from Central Islip. This year, crew members will be bused to different cleanup sites and will primarily remove trash, but also will do some planting and beautification work, she added.

The cleanup effort, founded by longtime Brentwood activists and cousins Marcos Maldonado and Mike Ramos, was started four years ago as a project in which volunteers painted over graffiti in Brentwood and Central Islip in an effort to scrub the area of signs of gang activity.

NewsDay,New Guidelines Suggest HIV Screening for All Adults,"New guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force call for virtually every adult to be routinely screened for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

The updated recommendations, which are published in the April 30 issue of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggest that pregnant women and all people aged 15 to 65 be screened for HIV. The guidelines are now more in line with screening recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

""HIV is a critical public health problem. There are 50,000 new infections in the U.S. each year, and we need to find ways to prevent and treat it,"" said guideline author Dr. Douglas Owens, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a senior investigator at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System, in California.

The guidelines, last updated in 2005, reflect new evidence about the effectiveness of treatment, especially when started early in the course of HIV infection.

""The best way to reduce HIV-related death and disability is to avoid getting infected,"" Owens said. ""Should someone become infected, we want them to understand that there are very good treatments that will help them live longer and reduce transmission.""

Experts agreed that such blanket screening is the best -- and possibly only -- way to stop the HIV epidemic in its tracks.

Knowing one's HIV status is ""a first step for both prevention and needed medical services, yet the history of the epidemic has set up barriers such that, in some states, it is still not straightforward to access an HIV test without the need for written consent or a fee,"" said Dr. Sten Vermund, director of the Institute for Global Health at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. ""Free, regular screening for HIV, much as we try to have regular blood pressure or breast cancer screening, is one of the best ways to start reducing the HIV epidemic in the U.S.""

Another expert agreed.

""There is a growing -- and overdue -- realization that treating HIV infection has both a personal and public health benefit,"" said Dr. Paul Volberding, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. He wrote an editorial accompanying the guidelines.

""We may have a chance to end the AIDS epidemic, but that all begins with diagnosing infection in the estimated 20 percent of cases in the U.S. [who are] unaware of their status and thus not in medical care,"" he said. ""Finding infected persons, bringing them into care, suppressing their HIV levels and retaining them in that state are the overriding goals of HIV control. These guidelines, along with those of the CDC, can help in the first step in that care cascade.""

""HIV therapy is the most effective means of preventing all forms of transmission,"" Volberding said. ""The importance of treatment as prevention was underscored by the very recent failure of the only candidate HIV vaccine in large clinical trials. We may well have to treat our way out of the epidemic, and that process begins with diagnosis and ends with lifelong engagement in care.""

NewsDay,"HIV 'Cure' Looks 'Promising,' Danish Scientists Contend","Danish scientists testing a novel HIV treatment in human trials contend that they're confident their strategy will result in a cure for the AIDS-causing virus, according to news reports.

The technique -- already tested successfully in lab experiments -- involves freeing the HIV virus from DNA cells, where it collects in ""reservoirs,"" and bringing it to the surface of the cells, the Telegraph in Great Britain reported. Once the virus has surfaced, it can be permanently destroyed by a ""vaccine"" that primes the body's natural immune system, the researchers said.

""I am almost certain that we will be successful in releasing the reservoirs of HIV,"" said Dr. Ole Sogaard, a senior researcher at the Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, according to the news report. So far the clinical trials are ""promising,"" he said.

Human clinical trials are under way, said Sogaard, adding that early signs are ""promising. I am almost certain that we will be successful in releasing the reservoirs of HIV,"" he said.

Fifteen patients are currently taking part in the trials, and if they are found to have successfully been cured of HIV, the ""cure"" will be tested on a wider scale, the Telegraph reported.

""The challenge will be getting the patients' immune system to recognize the virus and destroy it. This depends on the strength and sensitivity of individual immune systems,"" Sogaard said, the newspaper reported.

Sogaard said a ""cure"" is different than a preventative vaccine. That means continued awareness of unsafe behaviors -- such as avoiding unprotected sex or sharing needles for intravenous drug use -- is still the key to combating HIV.

If the Danish researchers are successful, it would obviously represent a huge step in the battle against HIV.

A large study of an experimental HIV vaccine was halted recently because the shots weren't preventing infection, the U.S. National Institutes of Health said last week.

The clinical trial included about 2,500 people, mostly gay men, in 19 cities. Half of the participants were given the vaccine developed by the NIH and half received placebo shots. A safety review found that slightly more people who had received the vaccine later became infected with HIV. The reasons for this aren't clear.

While the vaccinations are being stopped, the NIH said it will continue to track the study participants' health, the Associated Press reported.

Numerous attempts to develop an HIV/AIDS vaccine have failed.

Millions Being Donated for Boston Bombing Victims

Donations are pouring in as people hold fundraisers and set up online crowd-funding sites to help the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing pay for their medical expenses.

One Boston city fund has already collected more than $23 million in donations from individuals and corporations, the Associated Press reported.

But it's not clear if the donations, along with health insurance other sources, will be enough to cover the medical bills for the more than 260 people who were wounded in the attack. At least 15 victims lost limbs, and other injuries include head wounds and shrapnel-shredded tissue.

The cost of leg amputation is at least $20,000, rehabilitation therapy for amputees is tens of thousands of dollars, and the cost of an artificial leg can range from $7,200 to as much as $90,000 , according to the AP.

A salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 73 people in 18 states has been linked to cucumbers from two Mexican growers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says.

The agency said that cucumbers from the two growers are being stopped at the border, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that all of the contaminated cucumbers are now off the market, USA Today reported.

The first cases of the salmonella outbreak began in January and the last known case began April 6, according to Lola Russell, a spokeswoman for the CDC. She said no deaths have occurred in the outbreak, but 27 percent of people who became ill have been hospitalized.

The tainted cucumbers were linked to Daniel Cardenas Izabal and Miracle Greenhouse of Culiacn, Mexico. The cucumbers were distributed in the U.S. by Tricar Sales of Rio Rico, Ariz., USA Today reported.

NewsDay,George W. Bush presidential library opens amid pomp,"DALLAS -- Presidents past and present lionized one of their own Thursday, putting politics aside as President George W. Bush dedicated the library that documents his place in history.

""My deepest conviction, the guiding principle of the administration, is that the United States of America must strive to expand the reach of freedom,"" Bush said. ""I believe that freedom is a gift from God and the hope of every human heart.""

President Barack Obama praised his predecessor's strength and resolve after 9/11, calling Bush a ""good man"" who faced the storm head-on. They spoke along with the three other living former presidents in a rare reunion at the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. ""To know President George W. Bush is to like him,"" Obama said.

The presidents lauded Bush's effort to reach across the aisle on issues such as immigration and education and his leadership in the days after the 2001 terrorist attacks. But they avoided the two wars that dominated much of his time in office -- Iraq and Afghanistan.

The presidents -- Obama, Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter -- were cheered by a crowd of former White House officials and world leaders as they took the stage together to open the dedication. They were joined on stage by their wives -- the nation's current and former first ladies -- for the outdoor ceremony on a sun-splashed Texas morning.

""There was a time in my life when I wasn't likely to be found at a library, much less found one,"" Bush, 66, joked.

President George H.W. Bush, who has been hospitalized recently for bronchitis, spoke haltingly for just about 30 seconds while seated in his wheelchair, thanking guests for coming out to support his son. A standing ovation lasted nearly as long as his comments.

Clinton, too, was warmly received by the heavily Republican crowd, who applauded and laughed along with his joke-peppered speech. He concluded on a serious note about the importance of the leaders coming together. ""Debate and difference is an important part of every free society,"" he said.

NewsDay,Deadly Meningitis Cases Worry Gay Community,"A series of bacterial meningitis cases in Southern California and New York City, resulting in the deaths of several gay men, have set the gay community on edge. However, preliminary tests suggest the cases on each coast aren't connected.

Health activists became concerned in Los Angeles after a 33-year-old gay attorney from West Hollywood suddenly became ill from meningitis and died on April 13. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which advocates for health for gay men, initially criticized local health officials for not pushing for vaccinations. However, ""we don't think it's part of an outbreak or due to him being a gay man,"" said Dr. Wayne Chen, the organization's acting chief of medicine.

Still, the Los Angeles County's public health department is offering meningitis vaccinations for free for those who are poor or uninsured.

In New York City, health officials are recommending that certain groups of gay and bisexual men, along with certain visitors to the city, get vaccinated against meningitis.

According to Los Angeles County health officials, four cases of meningitis in gay or bisexual men have been confirmed in the region since December, including one 30-year-old who died of meningitis in Los Angeles, and another man of the same age who died in the San Diego area, both in December, according to news reports.

The officials say the four Los Angeles cases in gay and bisexual men don't appear to be ""highly related"" to those elsewhere in Southern California or in New York City.

In New York City, officials have noted more than 20 meningitis cases since 2010 in gay or bisexual men; seven of the men died. The city recommends vaccinations for any HIV-infected gay or bisexual men and those who have had close or intimate contact with men they met via websites, apps or at bars or parties. Visitors who have been to the city since Sept. 1 and engaged in these types of activities should get vaccinated too, city officials added.

Meningitis is transmitted through close contact with an infected person and kills, often quickly, by causing the lining around the brain to swell. It commonly spreads through places where people live closely together, such as dorms and military housing.

Meningitis hasn't previously been connected to gay men in particular, Chen said.

Many people have the bacteria that cause meningitis in their nasal passages, but the germs often don't cause problems, said infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner, chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""They can carry these bacteria for long periods of time and transmit them to other people without being aware of the process.""

The germs can create a mild illness at first that can quickly turn deadly, especially if the bacteria gets into the bloodstream, he said.

""You feel kind of punky, and you maybe have a sore throat,"" Schaffner said. ""You lose your appetite, you get drowsy. Then you can slip into a coma.""

Antibiotics effectively treat bacterial meningitis, he said, but they must be given quickly. That's why people should seek medical care if they suffer from symptoms like stiff neck, high fever (beyond 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit) or severe headache, he said.

Meningitis vaccines cost about $100, Chen said, and can cause side effects that are similar to those possible in people who get flu vaccines. The vaccines work against most strains of meningitis, Schaffner said, and take 10 to 14 days to become effective.

NewsDay,Iran denies link with Canada terror plot suspects,"Two men face bail hearings Tuesday after their arrest on charges of plotting a terrorist attack against a Canadian passenger train with support from al-Qaida elements in Iran, authorities said. The case has raised questions about Shiite-led Iran's murky relationship with the predominantly Sunni Arab terrorist network.

Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, and Raed Jaser, 35, had ""direction and guidance"" from al-Qaida members in Iran, though there was no reason to think the planned attacks were state-sponsored, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner James Malizia said Monday. Police said the men did not get financial support from al-Qaida, but declined to provide more details.

""This is the first known al-Qaida planned attack that we've experienced in Canada,"" Superintendent Doug Best told a news conference. Officials in Washington and Toronto said it had no connections to last week's bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told reporters on Tuesday there is no evidence of any Iranian involvement and groups such as al-Qaida have ""no compatibility with Iran in both political and ideological fields.""

""We oppose any terrorist and violent action that would jeopardize lives of innocent people,"" he said.

Mehmanparast called the Canadian claims part of hostile policies against Tehran, and accused Canada of indirectly aiding al-Qaida by joining Western support for Syrian rebels. Some Islamic militant factions, claiming allegiance to al-Qaida, have joined forces seeking to topple the regime of Bashar Assad, one of Iran's main allies in the region.

Charges against the two men include conspiring to carry out an attack and murder people in association with a terrorist group. Police said the men are not Canadian citizens and had been in Canada a ""significant amount of time,"" but declined to say where they were from or why they were in the country.

The arrests in Montreal and Toronto bolstered allegations by some governments and experts of a relationship of convenience between Iran and al-Qaida.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Bruce Riedel, a CIA veteran who is now a Brookings Institution senior fellow, said al-Qaida has had a clandestine presence in Iran since at least 2001 and that neither the terror group nor Tehran speak openly about it.

""The Iranian regime kept some of these elements under house arrest,"" he said in an email to The Associated Press. ""Some probably operate covertly. AQ members often transit Iran traveling between hideouts in Pakistan and Iraq.""

U.S. intelligence officials have long tracked limited al-Qaida activity inside Iran. Remnants of al-Qaida's so-called management council are still there, though they are usually kept under virtual house arrest by an Iranian regime suspicious of the Sunni-/Salafi-based militant movement. There are also a small number of financiers and facilitators who help move money, and sometimes weapons and people throughout the region from their base in Iran.

Last fall, the Obama administration offered up to $12 million in rewards for information leading to the capture of two al-Qaida leaders based in Iran. The U.S. State Department described them as key facilitators in sending extremists to Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. Treasury Department also announced financial penalties against one of the men.

The investigation surrounding the planned attack was part of a cross-border operation involving Canadian law enforcement agencies, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The attack ""was definitely in the planning stage but not imminent,"" RCMP chief superintendent Jennifer Strachan said Monday. ""We are alleging that these two individuals took steps and conducted activities to initiate a terrorist attack. They watched trains and railways.""

Strachan said they were targeting a route, but did not say whether it was a cross border route. Best said the duo had been under investigation since last fall. Esseghaier's bail hearing was scheduled in Toronto and Jaser's hearing was scheduled in Montreal on Tuesday.

Via Rail said that ""at no time"" were passengers or members of the public in imminent danger. Via trains_Canada's equivalent of Amtrak passenger trains in the U.S. —carry nearly 4 million passengers annually.

In Washington, Amtrak president Joe Boardman said the Amtrak Police Department would continue to work with Canadian authorities to assist in the investigation. Via Rail and Amtrak jointly operate trains between Canada and the U.S.

Canada's Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said the arrests show that terrorism continues to be a real threat to Canada.

""Canada will not tolerate terrorist activity and we will not be used as a safe haven for terrorists or those who support terrorist activity,"" Toews said in the House of Commons.

U.S. Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, said in a statement praising Canadian authorities for the arrests, that the attack was intended ""to cause significant loss of human life including New Yorkers.""

Muhammad Robert Heft, who runs an outreach organization for Islamic converts, and Hussein Hamdani, a lawyer and longtime advocate in the Muslim community, said one of the suspects is Tunisian and the other is from the United Arab Emirates. Heft and Hamdani were part of a group of Muslim community leaders who were briefed by the RCMP ahead of Monday's announcement.

In Abu Dhabi, a UAE source informed about the attack plot said there was ""no UAE citizen"" with the name Raed Jaser. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.

Authorities were tipped off by members of the Muslim community, Best said.

The Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim civil liberties organization, planned to hold a news conference in Toronto on Tuesday to comment on the terror-related arrests.

A spokeswoman for the University of Sherbrooke near Montreal said Esseghaier studied there in 2008-2009. More recently, he has been doing doctoral research at the National Institute of Scientific Research, a spokeswoman at the training university confirmed.

Julie Martineau, a spokeswoman at the research institute, said Esseghaier began working at the center just outside Montreal in 2010 and was pursuing a Ph.D. in nanotechnology.

""We are, of course, very surprised,"" she said.

A LinkedIn page showing a man with Esseghaier's name and academic background said he helped author a number of biology research papers, including on HIV and cancer detection. The page says he was a student in Tunisia before moving to Canada in the summer of 2008.

The page carries a photo of a black flag inscribed with the Muslim declaration of faith: ""There is no god but God and Muhammad is his prophet."" The same flag was used by al-Qaida in Iraq and then started being used by ultraconservative Islamic groups in Egypt, Tunisia, Mali and elsewhere across the region.

In Markham, Ontario, north of Toronto, police tape cordoned off half of a duplex, with officers remaining at the scene well into the night. Sanjay Chaudhary, who lives in the other half of the duplex with his family, said the RCMP questioned him about his neighbor Jaser, asking whether he knew him or spoke to him often.",23/04/2013
NewsDay,HIV Drugs May Help Protect Young Patients' Hearts: Study,"Long-term use of powerful drug cocktails known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may help protect the hearts of children and teens infected with HIV, a new study reports.

HAART is a form of antiretroviral therapy that is widely used to treat people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Prior to the introduction of antiretroviral therapies, youngsters infected with HIV were at increased risk for heart failure, noted a team led by Dr. Steven Lipshultz of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

Since the advent of powerful HIV-suppressing medications, ""the effects of HIV and [antiretroviral therapy] on the cardiovascular system of HIV-infected children are not completely understood,"" the researchers wrote in the April 22 online issue of JAMA Pediatrics. They pointed out that such children are exposed to these drugs for many years, often beginning while they are still in the womb, but the effects on their cardiovascular systems ""are unknown.""

The new study sought to clear that up. It included nearly 600 HIV-infected and uninfected patients from 14 pediatric HIV clinics across the United States.

According to the team, heart function was better among HIV-infected children receiving HAART than those who were infected with HIV and did not receive HAART, and children who were exposed to HIV but not infected.

""Our results indicate that the current use of combination [antiretroviral therapy], usually HAART, appears to be cardioprotective in HIV-infected children and adolescents,"" the study authors reported. ""This finding is even more relevant in the developing world where the prevalence of HIV disease in children is much higher.""

The researchers added that further study comparing different drug regimens might be beneficial ""in optimizing HIV outcomes and protecting long-term cardiac health"" of children with HIV.

The company said the agreement maximizes its chances of getting a better proposal from Icahn while protecting shareholders from the accumulation of an ""unduly influential voting interest.""-- AP",16/04/2013
NewsDay,State lawmakers to consider medical marijuana bill,"Debate over a state bill to legalize marijuana use for some illnesses is heating up this week, with proponents saying they are optimistic legislation, for the first time, has a chance to pass in both chambers.

State Sen. Diane Savino of Staten Island and Assemb. Richard Gottfried of Manhattan, both Democrats, are holding a news conference Tuesday in Albany to promote a bill they introduced last month that would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana to people suffering from certain ""serious"" conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS or multiple sclerosis.

Gottfried, who championed three medical marijuana bills that passed the Assembly in 2007, 2008 and 2012 but died in the Senate, said he believed this bill might be different.

""I'm optimistic this year partly because polling data continues to show a rising level of public support,"" he said.

Polls by Quinnipiac University and Cornell University in 2010 showed that about two-thirds of New Yorkers favor allowing medical marijuana use. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia now have legalized medical marijuana -- this although the federal government still lists it as a drug with the same abuse potential as heroin and LSD.

Gottfried, who chairs the Assembly health committee where the bill will be voted on Tuesday, said he expected it to pass in that house ""in the next month or so.""

The state Senate bill is also in the health committee, chaired by Republican Sen. Kemp Hannon of Garden City, who hasn't signaled how he views it.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has in the past stated his opposition to legalizing medical marijuana. But Gottfried was hopeful the governor could be persuaded. ""From informal discussions I've had with executive staff, I am hopeful that if a tightly drafted bill like this begins to move in the Senate, we can work with the executive to address any concerns they might have,"" he said.

Savino said she believes the bill, patterned on ones passed in Connecticut, New Jersey and Colorado, answers concerns that pot could be prescribed to those who don't need it or diverted for recreational use.

But opponents, including a group of addiction experts from Long Island, are preparing to meet with legislators Wednesday in Albany to argue the bill is still too lax.

""I think they have floated what they're calling a tighter medical marijuana bill . . . when in fact, it's the same old warmed-over stuff,"" said Jeffrey Reynolds, executive director of the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.

Reynolds said he was troubled the bill lists individual conditions ""that are very hard to diagnose"" such as fibromyalgia and includes conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. He also worries that the state will be unable to properly monitor marijuana use.

The bill legalizes possession and use of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for patients with ""severe debilitating"" or ""life-threatening"" conditions who the doctor believes are ""likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit"" from its use.The bill says patients would have to register with the state, and businesses or organizations that wish to sell marijuana would also have to register and pay a tax of $250 for each pound. Manufacture could only take place in an indoor ""secure"" facilityunder the bill.",15/04/2013
NewsDay,"10 Years On, Still Much To Be Learned From Human Genome Map","As scientists mark the 10th anniversary Sunday of the completion of the Human Genome Project, they will note how that watershed effort has led to the discovery of the genetic underpinnings of almost 5,000 diseases.

And it has made it possible to develop personalized treatments that have prolonged the lives of many.

But the scientists will also acknowledge that, while the project has unlocked many mysteries that once shrouded diseases, there's still much to be learned before new drugs can be developed to target illness-causing mutations in human DNA.

""What we've learned over the past 10 years is that we're still far from really understanding the complexity of the human genome,"" said Eric Schadt, chairman of genetics and genomic sciences at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. ""Human disease is way more complicated than the old view that single hits to single genes cause diseases.

""In most forms of diseases, it's whole constellations of genes operating in networks,"" Schadt explained. ""That becomes a much harder problem. How do you target networks with a single drug?

""We keep learning how much we really don't know and how much further we need to go,"" he added. ""That's the big story.""

A decade ago, the Human Genome Project was hailed as a major milestone because researchers identified all of the nearly 25,000 genes in human DNA and sequenced the 3 billion chemical base pairs comprising that DNA.

The feat took 13 years and cost close to $3 billion, but the genetic information gleaned from the project gave scientists the tools needed to pinpoint how changes in specific genes could kick-start some diseases.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

One of the most tangible benefits of the project has been the development of ever more sophisticated sequencing technology and a dramatic lowering of the cost of using that technology.

Today, the cost of sequencing one human genome is closer to $5,000 and can be done in a day or two, said Dr. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Md.

What that means is that the pace of research, and its attendant discoveries, has been accelerated.

When the project first began, scientists knew the genetic basis of about 53 diseases. Today, that number is close to 5,000, Green noted. That means doctors can now test patients to see if they carry gene mutations that raise their risk for certain diseases, and counsel them accordingly on ways they might prevent or delay illness. There are currently almost 2,000 genetic tests for specific diseases or conditions, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

There have also been breakthroughs with some rare diseases.

In 2011, 6-year-old Nicholas Volker became the first child to be saved by the new technology. He had undergone a hundred surgeries, including the removal of his colon, as doctors tried to identify his mysterious bowel disease. Genomic sequencing uncovered a genetic mutation that could be treated with a bone marrow transplant consisting of cells from umbilical cord blood.

""Knowing more of the basic genetics that makes up an individual has allowed us to diagnose far more genetic diseases,"" said Dr. Barbara Pober, a medical geneticist at the Frank H. Netter, M.D. School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University in North Haven, Conn.

Once a diagnosis has been made, doctors can now use gene sequencing to determine treatment for some diseases. For instance, breast cancer patients can be tested to see how they will respond to the drug Herceptin. HIV patients can be tested to determine their response to the drug abacavir. And those on the widely used blood thinner warfarin can be tested to determine the most effective dose, according to the NIH.

The field of pharmacogenetics, still in its infancy, enables doctors to use a patient's genetic information to figure out which cancer drugs the patient will best respond to before treatment even starts.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now includes genetic information on labeling for more than 100 drugs, up from just four 10 years ago, Green said.

The goal of developing new drugs to target diseases with genetic roots, however, will take much longer to realize.

Although the NIH states that there are roughly 350 biotechnological products currently being tested in clinical trials, new drugs take a decade or more to develop. Not only that, the knowledge gained from the Human Genome Project has actually made the field of genetic medicine even more complex. Scientists are finding that many diseases are triggered by interaction involving multiple gene variants, making it difficult to design a treatment that targets all the culprits in a particular illness.

And the complexities don't end there.

Not long ago, scientists discovered that so-called ""junk"" DNA, which makes up 98 percent of the genome, is not junk at all but serves critical regulatory functions.

What's more, about 10 percent of the human genome still hasn't been sequenced and can't be sequenced by existing technology, Green added. ""There are parts of the genome we didn't know existed back when the genome was completed,"" he said.

NewsDay,Filler: Long Island will buzz along unscathed,"When I first heard about ""colony collapse disorder,"" I feared it was what happens on Long Island when property values drop 30 percent, taxes rise, and politicians talk about cutting Social Security and Medicare. It would have explained so much: the road rage, the tween girls with the word ""Juicy"" emblazoned across their tuchuses, and the fleeing to other climes.

But colony collapse disorder doesn't affect people, it kills bees en masse, and it isn't happening on Long Island. What's more, it's not the only creepy crawly problem bypassing us. We will also miss the once-every-17 years cicadapalooza set to hit this spring.

Long Island gets some cicadas every year, and we will this year too. But what is projected for most of the East Coast is a cicadapocalypse, the re-emergence of ""Brood #2"" for the first time since 1996, as soon as ground temps reach 64 degrees.

Long Island hosts other cicada broods, each of which re-emerges every 13 or 17 years, according to Cornell Cooperative Extension entomologist Dan Gilrein, but it won't experience the onslaught of millions of cicadas per acre from this one.

Avoiding the cicadastorm should be as sweet as honey, made by honeybees, whose situation is more complicated. Colony collapse disorder first surfaced around 2005, killing honeybees and wiping out as many as 50 percent of hives nationally. Honeybees pollinate about one-quarter of the food we eat -- and the food we should eat more of, like cherries, melons and onions.

But on Long Island, where honeybees help our pumpkins and strawberries and apples blossom and taste awesome, ""We haven't seen any of the large-scale loss of bees that would characterize CCD,"" said George Schramm, president of the Long Island Beekeepers Club. That's positive for our agriculture, and gardens, and for local honey producers and allergy sufferers who rely on local honey to combat the ills caused by local pollen. Parts of New York, and at least 34 other states, are seeing colony collapse disorder, likely an agricultural clash between edgy technology and ancient methods.

Modern cash crops are often sown ""monoculturally,"" meaning a given area is entirely devoted to one crop. The best example vis-à-vis bees is California's San Joaquin Valley, where 80 percent of the nation's almonds are grown on 800,000 acres. That demands more than 1.5 million beehives to pollinate them for a few weeks. Professional beekeepers take their hives to almond country, then fan out across the nation to pollinate apples and melons and such.

Theories abound about why honeybees are dying, but most evidence points to increased pesticide levels, and in particular, a type called neonicotinoids.

Long Island doesn't have much monocultural farming of wheat, soy or corn, missing out on some of the worst use of pesticides embedded in seeds or applied to fields. Thus our bees thrive. But only a tiny percentage of what most Long Islanders eat is grown locally. Colony collapse disorder has the potential to be a real food-supply problem. If the honeybee population collapses, crops that depend on honeybees for pollination will fail for everyone.

People often say, ""If folks living 100 years ago could see us today they'd be amazed at our iPads and Wiis."" It's not true.

A grown-up living in 1913 saw the popularization or invention of electricity, the telephone, cars, planes and a dozen other things. He or she would assume we would develop fantastic new inventions. What would surprise our forebears is that we are still at the mercy of honeybees and cicadas. They'd expect us to have figured out pollination and biblical plagues by now.

Most surprising, and pleasing, to modern old me? The idea that, for once, multiple, huge problems would descend everywhere BUT Long Island.

WASHINGTON: Immigration bill's provisions

Federal authorities would be required to establish vast new border fences and surveillance as part of a bipartisan Senate plan aimed at allowing 11 million immigrants to earn permanent residency and, potentially, citizenship, aides familiar with the proposal said Wednesday. The provisions would call on the Department of Homeland Security to increase surveillance to cover 100 percent of the Southwestern border and to apprehend 90 percent of the people who attempt to enter the United States illegally, said the aides. An eight-member Senate group is near agreement on a comprehensive proposal for the most sweeping overhaul of immigration laws in three decades.





ARIZONA: HIV fear his motive for slayings

A man charged with fatally stabbing his wife and adult son in their suburban Phoenix home told investigators he carried out the killings out of a fear he had given his wife HIV from prostitutes he used to frequent and out of concern about what would become of his jobless son. Investigators said in court records that Eugene Maraventano, 64, believed his wife, Janet, 63, was ill and feared she might test positive for cancer or a disease he had given her from prostitutes he slept with when he worked for a rail line in New York. Maraventano, who planned to kill himself after killing his wife, wondered what would become of his son, Bryan, 27, after his suicide, according to a court document filed by police. Police say they haven't confirmed whether Maraventano had HIV or whether his wife had any of the ailments her husband said he was worried about.

NewsDay,Letters: Treating and reporting insanity,"Columnist Anne Michaud makes the case for catching mental illness early as a way of preventing mass shootings and puts her stamp of approval on such congressional proposals as educating police and school staff about mental illness and a public awareness campaign planned by the Obama administration [""Treat these young men before they kill,"" Opinion, April 4]. There are no easy answers, but surely education is an important part of the puzzle.

Before the age of 14, half of those who will go on to develop a mental illness are already showing symptoms. Yet students can graduate from high school without ever learning anything about mental illness. This is in sharp contrast to the comprehensive HIV/AIDS, substance abuse and sex education curriculum they're exposed to in health classes.

All students should be required to learn the warning signs of mental illness, the importance of seeking treatment and compassion for peers who are a little different, so that students aren't marginalized and feel comfortable acknowledging a mental disorder.

A grant our office received from the National Institute of Mental Health for our middle school lessons, ""Breaking the Silence,"" showed that they improved knowledge and changed attitudes -- and potentially behavior. What is needed now is the political will to require mental illness education as part of the health curriculum.

Janet Susin, Lake Success

Editor's note: The writer is the president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Queens/Nassau and co-author of ""Breaking the Silence.""



The article about treating mentally ill young men before they kill is a really reasonable and logical discussion of issues regarding deranged killings rather than just demonizing sportsmen.

After most of our mental hospitals were closed, starting in the 1960s, many individuals who previously might have been involuntarily evaluated, committed and treated became our ""homeless.""

In 2012, Connecticut tried to strengthen its outpatient treatment law. However, opponents such as the American Civil Liberties Union called the bill outrageously discriminatory and said it infringed on patients' privacy rights. The bill was defeated.

Background checks are a popular proposal for excluding the insane, but James Holmes, Jared Loughner and Seung-Hui Cho all passed because their names weren't included in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Unless NICS includes mentally ill people, checks are of little use.

NewsDay,Rewards of clowning attract older folks,"Several times a week, 74-year-old Bob Dillon dons bright red pants with checkered suspenders, a boldly striped shirt and a big red nose. His getup delights the patients at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, Queens, where the retired fabric salesman has found his second calling as Otto the Clown; performing skits and magic tricks and making balloon animals for the young audiences there.

Dillon is one among older-but-ageless clowns who is a paid entertainer at parties and other events, and also volunteers his special skills. Dillon and other older clowns say it's a fun way to earn money, or give back, while making people laugh.

Ask Cheryl Schruefer of Hicksville, whose strength, flexibility and energy belie her age (which she doesn't want published). Schruefer has been a professional clown since 1984 and has performed on stilts in Times Square and in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. At private parties, she also entertains while riding her unicycle or miniature bike, and can juggle, too. Her work clothes are loud and her shoes are oversized, all adding to her Tiny the Clown persona. Clowning is a career she loves, but because the jobs aren't always steady, she supplements her income by working at a booking agency and teaching clowning classes and circus skills.

Blame it on the nose

Schruefer first became intrigued with clowning at a mime class and found her calling after taking a class on clowning. ""When I put on that [red ball] nose, I knew,"" Schruefer says. ""My inner self came out. I thought, 'This is great.' When I went to clown college, I found out who I was."" She says she was shy as a child, even after taking acting classes, but with clowning, ""I let myself let loose.""

Schruefer has an associate degree in theater arts from Nassau Community College, and in 1984, she graduated from the three-month long Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College in Florida. Her costumes include a fluorescent purple outfit with extra long legs to cover her 4-foot stilts that add about 3 feet to her 5-foot tall frame; a neon pink wig, size 16 or so shoes and heavy-duty makeup -- not that she needs it, she says. ""You don't always need your makeup to be a clown. Think of Carol Burnett."" More recent examples, Schruefer notes, include Bill Irwin and David Shiner, clown-actors who star in an Off-Broadway show, ""Old Hats.""

Schruefer's success as Tiny the Clown can be measured by a marriage proposal from a smitten 9-year-old; global travel to China and beyond, and performing during an Orange Bowl halftime show. While some clowns just like to entertain and can afford to volunteer exclusively, she says, ""some people need this as their living.""

To make clowning a viable career, ""you have to stand out. You have to up your game a little bit. You need to rehearse more and practice, and to have something a little more special,"" Schruefer says. She knows it can be done. Her son, Michael, who just moved from Hicksville to New Jersey, is a full-time clown who entertains at parties and corporate events.

Clowning also is a family affair for Carol Klein, aka MisMatch the Clown and her son, Garrett, who, as YooHoo the Clown, helps her entertain at parties.

Klein, 58, of Levittown, has been clowning since 1984. Her interest was sparked when she took her kids to see a show at her local library. ""I loved the excitement of learning a whole new thing,"" she says. ""I was very shy at one point, and this helped.""

She studied, learning some trade tricks from a now-defunct clown group on Long Island. To keep current, she stays in touch with other clowns across the country by phone and computer, swapping hints and ordering props.

MisMatch performed at Nate Solomon-Kabelka's 1-year-old birthday party in February at a Greenlawn restaurant. ""She was amazing,"" says Nate's mom, Paige Solomon, of Northport. ""The kids were completely engaged. They loved the balloons that she made and were wearing them as hats.""

Klein says she chose the name MisMatch because, ""a clown's name is part of your heart. I'm so scattered, and I wanted to make people feel it's OK to be that way. Growing up and having a learning problem and wanting to get out of my shell got me started.""

She doesn't like being the center of attention, Klein says, but her stage makeup works like magic, allowing her to hide behind it, and the costumes help transform her into an entertainer, she says. ""It brings people to you.""

Her repertoire includes magic tricks, balloon animals and skits. ""I do it because I love it. Everything comes from the heart. It's become part of me over the years,"" Klein says. ""I love birthday parties and making kids feel good. That's one of my biggest things, to put a smile on their faces.""

Volunteering with vets

Klein also works full time as an aide at BOCES' Rosemary Kennedy School in Wantagh, and now she's also focusing on volunteer work with homeless veterans at the Northport VA Hospital through a group she started called ""Our Heroes Night Out"" (mismatchtheclown.com/

homeless_Veterans.html). Klein became involved after she was hired to do her clown act at a VA family event. ""It opened a whole new door for me. I would never have met these guys otherwise,"" she says of the veterans. Now, she's searching for other entertainers to donate their talent.

Like Klein, Bob Dillon appreciates the gigs that pay, but he also finds joy in volunteering in full costume and makeup. He's a regular at St. Mary's birthdays-of- the-month party and works with kids who attend an on-site day care center. ""They keep me in shape and on my toes as I get older,"" Dillon says of the youngsters.

""I feel like I'm banking something for upstairs, he says, motioning upward. ""At my age, I feel you should do more of that."" A resident of Franklin Square for 38 years, Dillon moved to Bellerose in 2005.

Clowns are magic with kids

At St. Mary's, Otto the Clown sets up his equipment as the kids settle in for the show. He's a familiar presence there, entertaining youngsters who have ""medically complex"" needs.

On a recent visit, Otto pulled out a pizza box from his clown trunk, but the box was empty. Otto asked, ""Does anybody know any magic words?"" Small hands shoot up as the kids shout, ""I do, I do."" And, to a chorus of ""PURPLE PUPPY CHOW,"" Otto checks and voilà; there's a pizza inside. But wait! There's more in the trunk -- pretend popcorn, and scarves masquerading as snakes.

Jordon Bailey, 4, is particularly engaged, running around and helping Otto with props, while checking in periodically with his mom, Shana, 41, who is there for a midweek visit. Jordon gets to go home to Brooklyn on Sundays and is learning to breathe on his own, without the help of a tracheotomy tube.

Dillon particularly likes to play music to get everyone clapping or dancing. One young patient isn't mobile, so he puts the music player in her bed to make her feel included. The tunes are like a prescription, he says. ""The music I play lightens everybody's day. The workers tell me they feel like they're at a wedding. And it lets me do something a little physical with them [the children], even if they're in a bed.""

Jennifer Maharajh, a former spokeswoman at St. Mary's, says Otto the Clown has won hearts all over the hospital. ""He really uplifts these kids and gives them the support they need. He makes them feel comfortable. He helps raise their self-esteem and shows them they can be who they want to be.""

Dillon began donating his time at hospitals in the late 1980s after reading a Newsday article about how Shriners clown to raise funds to support Shriners Hospitals for Children. When he worked at the Bellevue Hospital clinic for children born with the HIV, ""it gave me such an insight into the lives of these kids,"" he says. ""One day, I made lots of balloon animals for a little girl, and she went off in her bed surrounded by these animals. The next time I came back, she was gone. I was so glad I made her all those balloons.""

He welcomes his paying gigs for private parties, but volunteer work makes all the difference for him, he says. ""There's nothing better.""

Where are the clowns?

Clowns on Long Island can be hired through party booking and entertainment agencies, via a search on the Internet, or by referrals. Also, schools and libraries often keep lists of performers for summer and break programs.

Prices vary depending on the type of performance and length of time, but generally bookings start at $200.",04/04/2013
NewsDay,"For-profit body-part, tissue-industry practices under increasing scrutiny","Every day across Long Island, body parts collected from the dead are used to help the living.

These parts have myriad uses -- skin grafts for cancer patients, ligaments for damaged knees, bones to strengthen spines and even dental implants.

They are part of a $1-billion for-profit worldwide trade in human body parts that advocates say improves patients' lives.

Locally, North Shore-LIJ Health System -- New York State's biggest hospital group -- spent $3.7 million in 2012 for cadaver tissue used in surgery, obtained from vendors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

This brave new world in medicine faces increasing scrutiny by government and health care critics, who express concerns about whether body parts are adequately regulated and obtained with proper donor consent. They also say a system should be put in place so that body parts can be tracked from donor to patient.

""People have no idea that their tissue can be donated to a for-profit company as well as a not-for-profit,"" says George Annas, a bioethics expert at the Boston University School of Public Health, about the current system.

Experts say this growing for-profit market in body parts differs markedly from the established not-for-profit organ donation system, which depends largely on local volunteer sources for hearts, lungs and kidneys. Instead, with an increasing number of uses for human tissue, a Newsday and News 12 Long Island investigation has found that moneymaking firms made bone, skin and tissue available to Long Island facilities, some taken from cadavers as far away as Ukraine, records show.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Though it is illegal to sell body parts in the United States, current law allows private companies to charge fees for the collection and processing of human tissue. This has opened the door for a new industry providing skin, bone and tissue to clinics for everything from sports medicine to cosmetic surgery.

""It is different -- there's no question -- from the organ donor network,"" says Kevin Dahill, president of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, which represents 24 hospitals. ""We, the hospitals, have a lot more involvement with the not-for-profits.""

Both organ and tissue distribution systems rely on cadavers provided as a ""gift of life"" by donors. Yet, an organ donor who checks off a box on a New York State driver's license application may not fully understand that his or her skin, bones and other tissue may end up with a firm that can collect as much as $100,000 in fees per cadaver for those parts.

""There is a huge opportunity for misconduct,"" says Harvard Business School associate professor Michel Anteby, whose 2010 study of the use of cadavers in New York hospitals also looked at this growing trade in human body parts. ""It's difficult to control missteps, especially when a body gets cut into many parts, and the tracing and screening becomes very difficult.""

Uncertain origin

Federal health officials worry that doctors and their patients don't always know the provenance of the parts, and how and where they were obtained. Although even retail store items commonly are given bar codes so they can be traced back to their source in case of problems, human body parts used every day by doctors have no such codes, they say.

Inside a North Shore-LIJ operating room in Manhasset last year, Dr. Nicholas Sgaglione implanted a cadaver ligament into patient John Cascone's right knee. Neither the doctor nor the patient knew where the ligament originated.

""It's not important to me who it came from,"" explained Cascone, 41, a real estate appraiser from East Northport, in an interview last year. ""You trust your doctor and hope it will go successfully.""

Both hospital and patient relied on one of several FDA-approved tissue vendors serving Long Island hospitals to ensure the ligament was obtained with the donor family's consent and tested and treated to avoid HIV, hepatitis and other possible infection.

""Donor tissue and donor availability has tripled in the past 10 years,"" says Sgaglione, North Shore-LIJ's chair of orthopedics. ""However, there remains a need to be very careful and to scrutinize the practice of the tissue banks that are offering these products, because not all tissue banks are alike.""

Dentist's crimes exposed

Long Island hospitals and patients learned about the dark side of the trade in human tissue when local authorities in Brooklyn exposed in 2005 a criminal enterprise by former dentist Michael Mastromarino.

His New Jersey recovery firm paid funeral homes in three states $1,000 for each cadaver, which were then cut up and distributed without any medical testing and without the consent of donors or their families, according to court papers. Some of the body parts from these cadavers were implanted into at least 70 Long Island patients, records show.

Former New York City undercover cop William Hale, of Ridge, received a letter from New York State health official after the Mastromarino case broke informing him that a bone transplanted into his neck in November 2003 at St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson had been stolen from a diseased body taken from a Brooklyn funeral home.

""I was shocked -- my heart skipped a beat -- I couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" recalls Hale, 45, who says he has not suffered any health problems from the transplant.

Some families whose loved ones' bodies were illegally harvested by Mastromarino sued RTI Biologics, a Florida for-profit tissue vendor, for allegedly not properly monitoring his activities. RTI has denied the charges in court papers. A scheduled Oct. 22 civil trial in Staten Island was postponed amid appeals of legal arguments.

In 2012, RTI and other tissue vendors settled lawsuits from the Mastromarino case brought by some patients, including Hale. Hospital officials say no sicknesses have been reported among the Long Islanders who received these parts.

RTI Biologics officials declined to be interviewed for this story. However, the company has said it follows all federal guidelines to ensure the health and safety of their products.

""I was devastated that this was done to my father,"" says Stacy Brooks of Farmingville, who learned that her 79-year-old father's remains -- which she thought had been cremated -- were actually cut up by Mastromarino's firm, according to court papers. ""I know this was done without my father's permission. His will didn't say anything about allowing anyone to use his body parts.""

Mastromarino is serving a 15-30 year sentence as a convicted body-snatcher and is now ill with cancer, a prison official said. In a jailhouse interview outside Buffalo last year, Mastromarino characterized himself as a middleman for top tissue vendors.

Reliance on vendors

Since the Mastromarino case, Long Island's biggest hospitals have continued to use both for-profit and not-for-profit vendors without any known health problems, officials said.

Stony Brook University Hospital and Nassau University Medical Center say they rely on tissue banks to follow proper procedures with donors.

""During the normal course of business, North Shore-LIJ does not get detailed donor and origin information for tissue,"" explained spokesman Terry Lynam. ""The donor information is maintained by the vendor/tissue bank.""

Chris Hendriks, spokeswoman for Catholic Health Services of Long Island, which runs several local hospitals, said ""the vendors, not the hospitals, know where the tissue comes from.""

U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials declined requests to be interviewed for this story. In a written response to questions, however, the agency said vendors who supply medical facilities with cadaver parts are responsible for following its health and safety regulations.

Overall, more than 1.5 million body parts are distributed in the United States each year, but government and industry experts say the chance for infection is remote. FDA records show 40 suspected fatalities linked to cadaver tissue from 2002 to May 2012 nationwide. During that same period, a computer analysis shows, the FDA received 1,352 reports of ""adverse"" infection or illness linked to cadaver transplants.

Tissue vendors like RTI say the current system, mostly overseen by the FDA, involves regular inspections and responds adequately when problems arise.

But in December 2011, the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of cracks in the existing safety system. Agency officials said poor traceability methods slowed their investigation that year of 43 bones and tissue samples -- taken from a dead Kentucky man infected with hepatitis C -- that were sent around the nation. Fifteen were implanted in other patients, including a child in Boston who received a heart patch made of tissue that later tested positive.

""Oftentimes, there's an awkward silence. They say: 'We don't know where it went,' "" said Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, the CDC's director of Blood, Organ, and other Tissue Safety, last year.

Need to regulate better

As today's medical world finds more profitable uses for human tissue, the existing regulatory system must make sure donors are fully informed, says Laura Siminoff, chairwoman of the Department of Social and Behavioral Health at the School of Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert on the industry.

""It's not the job of doctors to regulate tissue and they can't be expected to have this burden placed on them,"" said Siminoff. ""I think we need to regulate this better as we do with organ donation."" She said adequate ""informed consent"" surrounding the use of dead bodies is particularly important.

Currently, about 18 percent of New York adults have a red heart symbol on their state driver's license, which means they have agreed to be unpaid donors of lifesaving organs and tissues when they die. After checking with a state-run registry of donors -- or securing the permission of survivors -- hospitals can allow private vendors as well as FDA-approved not-for-profit groups to use needed body parts.

But Siminoff said donors and their families generally don't know that their ""informed consent"" also means body parts can be sold by for-profit vendors for purposes such as cosmetic surgery and as bone paste for dental repairs.

A worldwide issue

Concerns over tissue donations are not confined to the United States.

In February 2012, police in Ukraine discovered human skins and other cadaver parts in the back of a minibus. The official Security Service of Ukraine said families had been tricked with false information and consent ""fraudulently obtained"" before their loved ones' bodies were cut and body parts illegally removed, according to the agency's statement.

RTI Biologics and its subsidiary, Tutogen Medical, have acknowledged importing tissue from Ukraine and making it available to U.S. hospitals and clinics, FDA health records show. According to a 2008 New York State health inspection, the last one by the agency, Tutogen made tissue from Ukraine available to Long Island hospitals and others in the state gathered from seven Ukrainian recovery sites. It is not clear if any hospitals ever used such material, a state health department spokesman said.

In September, RTI said it ""made a decision to voluntarily suspend import of tissues"" with state-owned suppliers in Ukraine, where authorities have carried out multiple investigations over allegations of illegal tissue recovery.

Experts like Siminoff and Annas say tougher federal regulation is needed of this increasingly complex and global market in body parts.

In the wake of the Mastromarino case, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) proposed a ""Safe Tissue Act,"" requiring better oversight of the industry. The bill failed to move ahead.

For his part, Cascone said he is grateful for his improved knee. ""I'm happy to be walking around and being able to play sports with my kids,"" Cascone said.

Doctors have assured Hale he's no longer at risk of getting hepatitis C or any long-term problem, but he remains worried.

""It's there in the back of my mind, and I had to make peace with it,"" said Hale. ""I don't know if anything will ever come of it. Nobody does. Nothing like this has ever happened before, so nobody can say.""

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists contributed to this story.

DONATION FACTS

According to state and medical experts:

-An estimated 18 percent of New Yorkers agree to be organ and tissue donors, granting legal consent for the recovery of organs, tissues and eyes for the purposes of transplantation and research at the time of death.

-By checking off a special box on a driver's license application, New Yorkers can agree to be donors, with their names then placed in a statewide registry. State Board of Elections and health departments have similar procedures. In confirming their consent with the state registry, potential donors can limit the terms and purpose for their donation.

-State health officials say a single donor of organs -- such as heart, liver, kidneys and others -- can save up to eight lives, while a tissue donor (bone, skin, heart valves, tendons, corneas) can improve 12 or more lives.

-Organ donation is primarily handled by not-for-profit agencies. But in recent years, tissue recovery has increasingly involved for-profit companies that pay for processing, transportation and other fees related to bone, skin and tissue ultimately provided to medical and dental clinics.

NewsDay,Drug maker Novartis loses India patent battle,"NEW DELHI - India's Supreme Court on Monday rejected drug maker Novartis AG's attempt to patent an updated version of a cancer drug in a landmark decision that health activists say ensures poor patients around the world will get continued access to cheap versions of lifesaving medicines.

Novartis had argued that it needed a patent to protect its investment in the cancer drug Glivec, while activists said the drug did not merit intellectual property protection in India because it was not a new medicine. In response to the ruling, Novartis said it would not invest in drug research in India.

The court's decision has global significance since India's $26 billion generic drug industry, which supplies much of the cheap medicine used in the developing world, could be stunted if Indian law allowed global drug companies to extend the lifespan of patents by making minor changes to medicines.

Once a drug's patent expires, generic manufacturers can legally produce it. They are able to make drugs at a fraction of the original manufacturer's cost because they don't carry out the expensive research and development.

Pratibha Singh, a lawyer for the Indian generic drug manufacturer Cipla, which makes a version of Glivec for less than a tenth of the original drug's selling price, said the court ruled that a patent could only be given to a new drug, and not to those which are only slightly different from the original.

""Patents will be given only for genuine inventions, and repetitive patents will not be given for minor tweaks to an existing drug,"" Singh told reporters outside the court.

Novartis called the ruling a ""setback for patients,"" and said patent protection is crucial to fostering investment in research to develop new and better drugs.

Ranjit Shahani, the vice chairman and managing director of Novartis India, said the ruling ""will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options.""

He said the court's decision made India an even less attractive country for major investments by international pharmaceutical companies.

""Novartis will not invest in drug research in India. Not only Novartis, I don't think any global company is planning to research in India,"" he said.

The Swiss pharmaceutical giant has fought a legal battle in India since 2006 to patent a new version of Glivec, which is mainly used to treat leukemia and is known as Gleevec outside India and Europe. The earlier version of Glivec did not have an Indian patent because its development far predated the country's 2005 patent law. Novartis said Glivec is patented in nearly 40 other countries.

India's patent office rejected the company's patent application, arguing the drug was not a new medicine but an amended version of its earlier product. The patent authority cited a provision in the 2005 patent law aimed at preventing companies from getting fresh patents for making only minor changes to existing medicines — a practice known as ""evergreening.""

Novartis appealed, arguing the drug was a more easily absorbed version of Glivec and that it qualified for a patent.

Anand Grover, a lawyer for the Cancer Patients Aid Association, which led the legal fight against Novartis, said the ruling Monday prevented the watering down of India's patent laws.

""This is a very good day for cancer patients. It's the news we have been waiting for for seven long years,"" he said.

Aid groups, including Medicins Sans Frontieres, have opposed Novartis' case, fearing that a victory for the Swiss drugmaker would limit access to important medicines for millions of poor people around the world.

Glivec, used in treating chronic myeloid leukemia and some other cancers, costs about $2,600 a month. Its generic version was available in India for around $175 per month.

""The difference in price was huge. The generic version makes it affordable to so many more poor people, not just in India, but across the world,"" said Y.K. Sapru, of the Mumbai-based cancer patients association.

""For cancer sufferers, this ruling will mean the difference between life and death. Because the price at which it was available, and considering it's the only lifesaving drug for chronic myeloid cancer patients, this decision will make a huge difference,"" Sapru said.

Leena Menghaney of Medicins Sans Frontieres said India would continue to grant patents on new medicines.

""This doesn't mean that no patents will be granted. Patents will continue to be granted by India, but definitely the abusive practice of getting many patents on one drug will be stopped,"" Menghaney said.

The judgment would ensure that the prices of lifesaving drugs would come down as many more companies would produce generic versions.

""We've seen this happening with HIV medicines, where the cost of HIV treatment has come down from $10,000 to $150 per year. Cancer treatment costs have come down by 97 percent in the case of many cancer drugs,"" she said.

""This decision is incredibly important. The Supreme Court decision will save a lot of lives in the coming decades,"" Menghaney said.

NewsDay,Bain: What Pope Francis can do to really help the poor,"In the days since Pope Francis was elected by the Papal Conclave, he has been quizzed on everything from his stance on the Falkland Islands to his role in Argentina's ""dirty war."" He has had to navigate diplomatic minefields - why was Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe at his inauguration, while British Prime Minister David Cameron wasn't? And he has faced scrutiny over his position on social issues like marriage equality and women in the church. But at his inaugural mass last Tuesday, Francis showed once again where his focus has been since he first took his vows, and where he wants it to remain.

The pontiff, Francis told the hundreds of thousands in attendance, ""must open his arms to protect all of God's people and embrace with tender affection the whole of humanity, especially the poorest, the weakest, the least important.""

It's a message that's more relevant than ever: Francis's papacy begins at a time when the globe has never been more socially unequal, economically volatile, or environmentally unsustainable. This is a world where 870 million men, women and children go to bed hungry every night, and where nearly one billion have no access to clean water; a world where whole countries are threatened with bankruptcy and seemingly stable regimes can collapse because of the price of grain; a world of manmade climate change and the plundering of creation for the few at the expense of the many.

The Roman Catholic Church, throughout its history, has worked for and alongside the poorest people in the world. Francis - a man with a strong history of working for the poorest in his home country of Argentina - now has the opportunity to reaffirm this focus, as well as expand the church's engagement on issues of poverty. But what can he actually hope to accomplish?

Much of the Catholic Church's work on poverty takes place at the ground level: It provides an estimated 25 percent of the care worldwide for people living with HIV and AIDS. It runs more than 5,000 hospitals, with nearly half of those located in the Africa and the Americas - the Catholic Health Association of the United States is also the largest group of non-profit health care providers in the country. The church runs nearly 20,000 clinics around the world, more than 15,000 homes for the elderly, those who are terminally ill, and the disabled, and nearly 10,000 orphanages, mainly in Asia.

But there is always room for the church to do more. Because it spans the world and stands outside the market, business, and government, it is well placed to look at the world afresh - especially at the beginning of a new papacy. It has the ability to offer a unique perspective on both the challenges of the poor and the actions of the rich that can cause poverty, from environmental degradation to the activities of global corporations. As pope, Francis can take advantage of the church's tremendous reach and influence to open up new conversations with different sectors of society on how to tackle these challenges productively.

Pope Benedict took a step toward this goal with a 2009 encyclical - a letter sent by the pope to his bishops - called Caritas in Veritate, or ""Charity in Truth."" In it, he warned of the dangers of unbalanced economic growth and against the pursuit of profit for its own sake. The encyclical had practical impact: The Catholic Church of England and Wales, for example, followed with a 2012 conference that brought major players in the business world - McKinsey, Barclays and Unilever, among others - for a discussion on how business could better serve society.

At Francis's inaugural, he spoke directly to the many powerful people in attendance - ""those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political, and social life"" - asking them to ""be protectors of creation, protectors of God's plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another, and of the environment."" It's a sign that he plans to continue to following the path that Benedict started down.

A renewed focus on social justice isn't just at the heart of the church's central purpose, in accordance with its faith and the teachings of Jesus Christ. It's also a vital component of the renewal and re-energization many claim is necessary for the modern church.

The new pope's emphasis on a church ""that is poor and is for the poor"" will resonate strongly with Catholic communities around the world. The majority of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics live outside Europe and North America. In ensuring the Catholic Church is responding to their priorities, Pope Francis can demonstrate to burgeoning congregations in Africa and the traditional stronghold of Latin America that he is a pontiff in touch with the immense challenges faced by ordinary people. And he also has a chance to engage new audiences in the increasingly secular developed world, who are looking for something more than the worship of material wealth and possessions.

Although an emphasis on care for the poor may be important for how the church is viewed by the rest of the world, this isn't a ""reformist"" agenda - the Catholic Church has worked for and with the poor throughout its history. Recent popes have challenged Western society's acceptance of the inevitability of poverty. Pope Benedict told us that the market was not the master of us all, but rather a tool that had to be used for the benefit of everyone, and that every human has the right to flourish to his or her furthest potential.

Francis' papacy can build on these previous teachings to further enhance the church's support for the world's poorest. In the words of our new pope's namesake, St. Francis of Assisi: ""It is no use walking anywhere to preach unless our walking is our preaching.""

NewsDay,Opinion: Let's ensure an AIDS-free future for all,"With the news earlier this month that a baby born with HIV may be suppressing the virus, it is markedly apparent that the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States has reached a turning point. New HIV infections among the general population are declining, and we possess the prevention tools and strategies to begin envisioning an ""AIDS-free generation.""

But while many consider HIV/AIDS a manageable disease, rates of infection remain unacceptably high among certain at-risk populations in the country, particularly Latinos. According to the Centers for Disease Control, Latinos have nearly triple the rate of new HIV diagnoses compared with whites, a more rapid progression to an AIDS diagnosis, and double the rate of AIDS-related deaths.

Recently, the CDC highlighted large gaps along the continuum of HIV/AIDS care for Latinos. Of the 220,400 U.S. Latinos infected with HIV, only 80 percent are aware of their status, 67 percent are linked to care following a positive diagnosis, and just 37 percent are retained in care. In total, only 26 percent of HIV-positive Latinos achieve viral suppression -- the point when the virus is no longer detected in the blood.

With fewer Latinos and African-Americans engaged in each stage of care compared with whites, the current HIV/AIDS system of care is clearly not working well for some.

The Latino HIV gap is not solely accounted for by individual behavior. However, it reflects multiple influences and historical inequities that make Latinos more likely to be exposed to HIV and less likely to treat it. For example, in New York, Latinos statewide are six times more likely to be living with HIV than are whites. With high clustering among Latinos by geographic area, Latinos are more likely to be exposed to HIV by virtue of their neighborhood.

The most recent CDC data also show that people aged 20 to 24 have the highest rate of new HIV diagnoses, suggesting that HIV is concentrated by age as well as neighborhood. As Latinos are a largely young minority group -- with 41 percent of the collective Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester populations younger than 25 -- Latino youth are particularly at risk.

With 33 percent of Latinos uninsured nationally, lack of insurance poses a significant barrier to regular testing and treatment. Latino immigrants are also more likely to delay HIV testing and care due to language barriers and fear of deportation.

Thus the challenge is to link communities in need with the powerful tools we know can save lives and reduce new infections.

While the Obama administration has made strides in addressing disparities in the nation's HIV epidemic through the creation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the Affordable Care Act, his second term will require renewed focus on the full implementation of these efforts, and the streamlining of services between prevention and care. Barriers to prevention and treatment must be addressed with targeted efforts to link Latinos with effective combinations of biomedical, behavioral and environmental interventions. This is critical for the metropolitan area, which has more than 4 million Latino residents and among the highest rates of of HIV/AIDS.

We do have powerful tools, but we need a renewed commitment to better connect them to communities of need. Only then can we make an AIDS-free generation a reality for everyone.

NewsDay,"Michigan, other states may regulate amateur MMA","LANSING, Mich. - Jerry ""The Moose"" Waterson fulfilled a dream last month by stepping into the ring for his first professional mixed martial arts fight, which he won.

His passion has become his full-time job, requiring 40 hours a week of training. But it took the 24-year-old Waterson four years of punching, kicking and grappling his way through Michigan's unregulated amateur system, where nearly anything goes and where fighters are often uninsured or could be infected with HIV or hepatitis.

""It's like the wild, wild west. It's crazy,"" Waterson said.

Michigan is among about a dozen states in which amateur MMA fights are legal but unregulated. That could soon change, however, as even lawmakers who recoil at the sport's brutality see the wisdom in setting ground rules.

""It is time to teach the beast some manners,"" said Democratic Rep. Harvey Santana, who is sponsoring legislation that would require promoters of amateur events to get licensed annually, carry up to $10,000 in health insurance for fighters and have a physician on site for fights.

MMA has exploded in popularity since the 1990s, led by its major brand, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and giving rise to an amateur industry that serves as the sport's minor leagues and offers fans a cheap night out or even the chance to get in the ring themselves. Combatants draw from various disciplines, including jiu jitsu, judo, boxing and wrestling, to try to knock out or subdue their opponents.

South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard recently signed off on the establishment of a state commission to regulate MMA, boxing and kickboxing, despite reservations that doing so would legitimize the fights.

Michigan legalized MMA bouts in 2007, and today most states allow professional bouts. They remain illegal in Connecticut and New York, but the state Senate in New York, where amateur fights are legal and unregulated, this month passed a measure to legalize and regulate the professional sport. When Michigan lawmakers legalized the sport, they stipulated that promoters must be licensed and carry insurance for fighters at pro events. But they didn't set requirements for amateur bouts.

No one tracks all Michigan's amateur fights, but Grand Rapids-area promoter and matchmaker Dru Gardner estimates that there 65 promoters in the state and that there are five events on any given weekend. Rob Fisk, a medic who works many of the fights, said the typical event draws from 500 to more than 2,000 spectators who plunk down $20 each to watch 20-or-so bouts.

While a pro fighter can earn $5,000 for a bout, amateur fighters earn nothing and compete for the thrill or because they harbor hopes of turning pro. In the meantime, amateurs put themselves at risk of serious injury or disease due to the lack of regulation, some lawmakers and promoters say.

Joe Battaglia, who runs a Michigan promotion company, said a fighter goes to the hospital at nearly every one of his events, and that broken noses, ribs and hands are among the most common injuries. Battaglia stopped fighting professionally after suffering a broken neck while training. Fortunately, he was insured.

Many promoters don't provide insurance and many fighters don't have their own, said Al Low, who co-owns the Fight Club Proving Ground gym with Battaglia. Amir Khillah, a pro fighter from Michigan, said he broke his arm in three places in his first bout in 2006. The promoter didn't carry insurance, so Khillah said he made himself a cast out of shin guards and duct tape. His arm is now crooked.

Lawmakers, fighters and promoters also point to a lack of pre-match blood testing, which puts combatants at risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis and other illnesses. The Association of Boxing Commissions, which is made up of the various state fighting commissions, has recommended that members ban amateur MMA fighters from Michigan, for fear of disease. And Bernie Profato, who heads the Ohio Athletic Commission, said he warns fighters that they won't be allowed to compete in Ohio if they fight in Michigan, for fear of spreading disease.

The lack of regulation means Michigan amateurs sometimes can't be protected from themselves. While the Association of Boxing Commissions keeps a database of fighters who have been suspended due to injury, a recent knockout or bad blood work, Michigan promoters aren't required to report to it.

""I know a guy who has been knocked out five times in the last year,"" said Gardner, the promoter. Someone getting knocked out that often ""is a serious liability for the entire sport.""

Last year, a 26-year-old South Dakota amateur fighter died a week after a bout from head injuries. Police said there wasn't enough evidence to conclude that the injury was suffered in the event.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's spokesman, Kurt Weiss, said in an email that Snyder supports making mixed martial arts safer and that the governor ""will continue to work with the Legislature to find the right approach to ensure that any new regulation will be self-supporting and that need for public health and safety is addressed.""

The promoters and amateur fighters calling for regulating the amateur fights made clear that it's for a love of the sport. Low said many of the young fighters who have taken up MMA at his gym learn discipline, confidence and self-worth.

""I've seen kids coming in here heavy set, out of shape with their heads down and you could barely hear them talk,"" Low said. ""Two years later, they are acting like they are Muhammad Ali.""",27/03/2013
NewsDay,French: China's first lady takes the stage,"SHANGHAI -- Is China having a first lady moment? It would certainly seem so. Peng Liyuan, aka Mrs. Xi Jinping, the wife of China's new president, has emerged swiftly and seemingly decisively, into an overtly more prominent first-lady role than we've seen for some time in China. To be fair she has the track record to be a front-and-center Spouse No. 1 -- she's long been a soprano singer of highly patriotic tunes with a voice that can hit the high notes and shatter glass. Her regular appearances on the long-running, and mostly just plain long, state TV traditional spring festival variety show mean she is universally known in China, whether formally clad in her trim People's Liberation Army olive uniform with plenty of blingy braid attached, or in one of her many elaborate ballgown belting out a song or three.

But with Xi's political elevation, so too Peng Liyuan's profile has been lifted. She has all the credentials -- she is photogenic, dresses extremely well, and has a record of championing good causes (she was an ambassador for tobacco control in 2009 and in 2012 was appointed as the ambassador for the fight against tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS for the WHO, an initiative aided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). When she recently stepped of the plane with Xi on an overseas trip, the photographers ate up her stylish black peabody coat, her spot-on high-bouffant hairdo, and a handbag of sumptuous leather that did not have any obvious branding (very important in these days of corruption crackdown and Chinese politicians being snapped with expensive Swiss watches and luxury European designer accessories that should be beyond the reach of fairly low-paid public officials).

All of this of course is no accident. Part of the Xi ""China Dream Team"" is the promotion of a first lady, something (if the Chinese blogosphere is to be believed) many Chinese have been waiting for after years of being fascinated with foreign first ladies from Michelle Obama to Carla Bruni to Cherie Blair. Going back of course, there's still a fascination among some with Jackie O., while, back in 1972, Pat Nixon intrigued the Chinese by wearing a rather scandalous red coat (her advisers told her the Chinese associated red with prostitutes) and accompanying her husband on tours of communes and schools. Obviously Peng Liyuan knows how to draw attention too, arriving with her husband in Tanzania on his recent swing through Africa in a well-tailored peach dress suit and with another luxurious leather, but again unbranded, handbag.

Still, as much as China watchers have argued that Peng Liyuan is the start of a new trend of prominent first ladies in China, the fact is that the tradition of prominent and controversial first ladies in Chinese politics is long and storied, dating all the way back to the birth of the Chinese Republic in 1911. And speculation about who is and who isn't a senior leader's consort has always been rife, at least unofficially. Indeed China's imperial system had a rigid and well defined ranking system of empress, consorts and concubines. There's some long history here: The Rites of Zhou, one of three ancient ritual texts listed among the classics of Confucianism and published sometime in the second century, stated that an emperor was entitled one empress, three madames, nine imperial concubines, 27 shifus (female masters), and 81 imperial wives.

Admittedly, since the 1980s, Chinese first ladies have been largely seen but not heard. Deng Xiaoping's wife, Zhuo Lin, often traveled with the paramount leader but was invariably well in the background; Jiang Zemin's wife, Wang Yeping, was seen even less, largely due to her frail health; Hu Jintao's wife, Liu Yongqing, was rarely photographed and said next to nothing publicly. Of course China loves gossip as much as anywhere, though the PRC is not getting its own TMZ anytime soon. Rumors of Jiang's close relationship with a well-known and popular singer indicated that Chinese leaders could have a taste for showgirls as much as any Kennedy.

It's not that senior leaders didn't have smart wives -- the wife of Mao's number two Chou En-lai, Deng Yingchao, was a political force in her own right and as urbane and sophisticated as her husband. She shared her husband's travails -- hiding out in the Astor Hotel in Shanghai during the 1927 White Terror -- and later chaired the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a rubber-stamp unelected parliament that ratifies Communist Party policy, from 1983 to 1988. But the guiding trend after the Maoist years was for the wives to stay in the background. Hua Guofeng, Mao's designated successor, was married to Han Zhijun, who was less prominent but was known as the mother of four children and an avid gardener apparently. The wife of Zhao Ziyang, the reformist and popular general secretary of the Communist Party who was ousted in 1989 for supporting the students at Tiananmen Square, loyally accompanied him into internal exile until his death. She was apparently an excellent chess player, passing much of the time checkmating her husband, according to Zhao's leaked secret journals, which were eventually published in 2009 after his death.

Before Mao, of course, there was Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling, Madame Chiang, one of the 20th-century's greatest first ladies, American-educated and from a wealthy and privileged family. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine no less than three times (Jackie Kennedy made the cover 17 times, but no other foreign first lady has done as well and few women either, with the notable exceptions of Princess Diana and the Virgin Mary). Madame Chiang clearly had the ability to captivate -- both Roosevelt and Churchill fell for her charms at the wartime Cairo Conference of 1943 where, according to the historian and Chiang biographer Jonathan Fenby, she vamped them both across the table. She was the very public face of China during the Sino-Japanese War, interpreted for her husband in meetings with foreign correspondents, and was undoubtedly one of the world's most stylish and fashionable women. Even after exile in Taiwan, followed by a life in obscurity in New York until she was 106, Madame Chiang was tabloid fodder, a highly public face of her husband's, and then stepson's, administrations, achieving almost regal status and, like all queens, having about as many detractors as admirers.

Soong Ching-ling (Madame Chiang's older sister) remains a highly visible figure in China as the wife of Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese revolutionary, first president and founding father of the Republic of China. That marriage was controversial to start with -- she basically, and scandalously, ran away from her family home to be with the much older Sun in Japan where he was plotting the Chinese republican revolution. Sun passed away in 1925, but Madame Sun kept a high profile is still revered today for having broken with her family's Nationalist allegiances and supporting the Communists, causing a rift between herself and her sister.

So with a prominent and stylish first lady by his side, is Xi about to inaugurate Beijing's version of Camelot? Probably not. Princes and showgirls don't always end well in China -- consider the best-known first lady to date: Jiang Qing, Madame Mao.

An ex-starlet in the Shanghai film studios, Jiang and her relationship with Mao raised some eyebrows back in the Yan'an cave days, when the stalwarts of the early Communist Party were ensconced in opposition. (They were, by and large, male and somewhat prudish and rather frowned on Mao's liaison with a woman from the glitzy entertainment world of Shanghai, regularly denouncing her as decadent and bourgeois.) Her later incarnation in the Cultural Revolution and with the ultra-leftist Gang of Four who were eventually purged and charged with treasonous crimes was enough to put the leaders that inherited Mao's throne off prominent first ladies for a good long time.

Camelot or no, the Western media is going to continue to watch Peng Liyuan closely -- and her sartorial choices in particular. In 1900, the Pittsburgh Press noted the arrival of Li Hongzhang in America, the best-known Chinese statesman internationally in the last years of the Qing Dynasty and leader of China's Self-Strengthening Movement. The Press reported that Mrs. Li ""is one of the most envied of Chinese women . . . accounted a leader of fashions . . . with an abundant quantity of glossy black which she takes great pleasure in dressing . . ."" Mrs. Xi can expect similar treatment. Back home, Peng and her accessories are already becoming something of an obsession for the Netizens of China -- the phrase ""Peng Liyuan hand bag"" had been searched on the popular portal Taobao more than 8 million times by last Monday night, but the top results were deleted by a nervous Net Nanny -- indeed, any Google search for ""Peng Liyuan"" is blocked as of this writing.

One thing Peng should not expect: a shoutout from her husband. China's political leaders rarely, if ever, engage in the pro-forma Western cliches of publicly thanking their spouses or family (or God) for their success. In the Beijing lexicon, the party stands in for mother, lover, and omnipotent power. ""The Chinese people"" sometimes get a nod of thanks, but mentioning home life would be unthinkable for a Chinese politician. And Mrs. Xi shouldn't expect to be allowed to say much, either, despite her celebrity: The days when Madames Sun and Chiang would sit next to their husbands and engage the foreign press corps in banter are not about to restart, not least because Chinese leaders don't really give interviews to the foreign press these days.

But Mrs. Xi might turn out to be different: She is confident and media-savvy, as witnessed by her close proximity to her husband at photo-ops and clearly thought-out and well-prepared outfits. She has yet to speak publicly -- perhaps she never will -- but her prominent visual image in and of itself indicates that Peng will be more like Madames Sun and Chiang than her immediate predecessors. This may well be the first Chinese administration since 1949 that successfully harnesses and exploits the soft power potential of a first lady.

Welcome on stage, Mrs. Xi.

New York City’s health department recommended the vaccination earlier this month for individuals “with contact” in high-risk areas of the city.

Since 2010, the severe bloodstream infection has killed seven men. In all, 23 men have become ill in the outbreak; 22 of them lived in New York City and the 23rd spent significant time in the city, the state health department said.

Gay men who have visited New York City since Sept. 1, 2012, should get the vaccine if they are HIV-infected and had sex or if they had “close or intimate sexual contact” with partners they met at a bar or party, online or through apps, it said.

NewsDay,Downtown Flushing: A changing nabe boasting a thriving business district,"Flushing is a bustling neighborhood with a downtown area home to businesses predominantly owned and operated by the community’s growing Asian population.

Signs in English are a rarity in downtown Flushing, which makes visitors feel like they have been transplanted to a foreign shore.

The mix of ethnicities has helped Queens become one of the most diverse counties in America.

“You come out of the 7 train and you almost feel like you’re in a different world,” said Ellen Kodadek, executive director for Flushing Town Hall, an arts and culture nonprofit. “I feel as though Flushing is really reflective of this country as a melting pot.”

The Asian community is deeply embedded in the area and nearly 80% of businesses have either Chinese or Korean owners.

A diverse array of authentic cuisines, products and services are available in the area. And lots of food.

“You’ll never go hungry,” Kodadek said.

While downtown Flushing is known as a Mecca of multiculturalism that is heavily urbanized, there are also suburban streets lined with trees that echo the neighborhood’s past.

Preservationists for years have tried to save some of the expansive houses and estates developed here between 1875 and 1925. These residences sit blocks away from modern high-rise buildings and shopping malls.

Flushing’s embrace of multiculturalism has roots in the neighborhood’s founding in 1645 by English settlers as a beacon of religious freedom. One settler, John Bowne, allowed Quakers to practice in his home, defying laws of the time. His house still stands, as well as the Old Quaker Meeting House on Northern Boulevard, which is New York City’s oldest house of worship.

Find it: The four borders of downtown Flushing are Willets Point Boulevard, College Point Boulevard, Northern Boulevard and The Long Island Expressway ( or Booth Memorial, if you want to take it a bit farther).

Local business owner on the bustling nabe

Stuart Schneiderman owns Flushing Lighting Fixtures and Supply Co Inc., one of the largest suppliers of specialty lighting in New York, which was established in 1927. The third-generation business was started by his grandfather.

Stuart, a Flushing resident and married father of two, grew up in Queens and attended Flushing High School, where he graduated in 1974 before attending Queens College.

Are you happy running a business in Flushing?

While I was very excited to take over and run this business 35 years ago, the community has changed to the point that continuing at this location is questionable.

Based on your experience, what do you think is the future for Flushing?

Flushing Lighting has been at this location for 85 years. Flushing has changed so much in the last 12 years. I think that in a few more years none of the legacy Flushing retail merchants will remain.

What has been happening in the area?

As with any community that has a large growth spurt, you have changes both good and bad. I deal with many wonderful people and can embrace new cultures. Many large, older homes and buildings are being torn down and multifamily dwellings are shoehorned onto the same footprint. Today, you also see a Manhattan-like skyline rising in Flushing. This is becoming a very crowded town. Traffic both auto and pedestrian is also reaching Manhattan-like proportions. Many new restaurants offer new and delicious foods from China, Japan and Korea, which truly supply a taste of foreign lands.

You can catch the Mets, of course, at nearby Citi Field. The park also contains the New York Hall of Science, the Queens Museum of Art, the Queens Theatre in the Park, Queens Wildlife Center, Queens Zoo, an ice-skating rink and a newly built skate park. The 1939 and 1964 World’s Fairs were held at the park and the remnants, such as the Unisphere and the New York State Pavilion, have become famous landmarks.

THE BUZZ

Plans are currently being batted around to create a stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to house a major league soccer expansion team.

MLS shelled out $1.7 million lobbying city officials in 2012 for the proposed stadium that would cost $300 million.

The stadium has the support of some city officials and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. However, the proposed stadium is controversial, because the 25,000-seat structure would occupy 13 acres of park land.

The residents of Flushing generate nearly 40% of their wages from the health care sector, according to a study by the New York State comptroller a year ago.

In 2010, about one-third of the neighborhood was employed in health care or another form of social assistance.

Big money is being poured into development projects to fix up the area and make it even more cosmopolitan and livable.

One of them is the Flushing Commons Project on 5.5 acres of city-owned land.

The project will include a town square, central fountain, 620 residential units, a YMCA facility, parking for more than 1,600 cars and thousands of square-feet that will be available for use by commercial and real estate properties.

The Rockefeller Development Corporation of Manhattan and TDC Development and Construction Corporation, a local Flushing developer, are joining forces to create the area.

Construction is set to start this fall.",20/03/2013
NewsDay,Long Island mom pens allergy book for kids,"Solve this riddle: If Mallory Sorkin, 6, of Roslyn, is not a squirrel, then how can the new children's book ""Nutley the Nut-Free Squirrel"" be all about her?

Answer: Because Mallory's mom, Stephanie, wrote the book to help Mallory and her friends understand when someone is allergic to peanuts. ""I'm not a squirrel, but I'm allergic to nuts,"" Mallory says. In fact, since the book has been published, the family's all been calling Mallory ""Nutley"" as a nickname, the kindergartner says.

The self-published children's book is written in verse and illustrated by Tim Warren. It's about a squirrel who gathers his other animal friends together to explain that when he eats nuts, like most other squirrels do, his eyes puff up and hives pop out. There, the dog declares that he's allergic to bones, and the pelican confesses he's allergic to fish.

""We really try to remain on the positive side,"" says Sorkin, a stay-at-home mother whose two other daughters, Kyra, 10, and Lea, 7, are allergic to pitted fruits and pollen, respectively. She initially made up the story for her kids but then thought she should share it as a fundraising and educational tool.

The book includes a recipe for ""Yummy Nut-Free Banana Bread"" at the end. It costs $14.95, and Sorkin says she'll donate either $5 or $13 from the sale of each book to FARE, depending on whether she has to share profits from the copy with a bookstore or website or sells the book on her own. FARE is an organization devoted to food allergy research and education. The book is available on amazon.com.",20/03/2013

NewsDay,Parker: Media myopia as conclave selects Pope Francis I,"WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON -- All things considered, I'd rather be in Rome. Wouldn't everyone?

Tout le journalism monde has descended on Rome since Pope Benedict XVI's surprise retirement last month. The ensuing Vatican intrigue has been appropriately sumptuous: Was it the gay cabal? Blackmail? Did the butler do it?

And now what?

The 115 cardinals electing the new pope finally made their choice Wednesday after weeks of finger-drumming by the international press. The Vatican's tiny communications office had been driven batty by 5,000 reporters who arrived with deadlines and little to report.

The Vatican, despite Pope Emeritus Benedict's relatively recent foray into the Twitterverse, apparently is not yet on the 24/7 news clock. The cardinals, according to one source in Rome, declined to be rushed by journalists. Meanwhile, reporters stateside daily embarrassed themselves by projecting their own values on to the centuries-old institution -- insisting that the church has to modernize on issues ranging from women priests to same-sex marriage to abortion. One colleague recently intoned a popular, if overwrought, sentiment: If the church doesn't change its position on women in the clergy, the church is doomed.

This is all laughable to anyone vaguely familiar with Catholic teaching. The Virgin Mary is at the center of the church and is otherwise known as the mother of God -- hardly a secondary role. Women who want to become priests may need a different church as the all-male priesthood is considered doctrinal. One doesn't easily amend that sort of thing.

For now, such issues are not of prime concern to the church or the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. Rather, Vatican concerns tilt more toward alleviating poverty in the developing world and ending the persecution of Christians.

And, of course, getting its own house in order.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

No one needs a primer on the scandals that have plagued the church the past few decades -- or the more-recent discoveries of financial mismanagement and the so-called ""gay cabal."" The new pope immediately will have to yoke himself to these burdens. Amid such troubles, not to mention managing a world religion, an assortment of eccentric personalities and a vast charitable and diplomatic empire, he will need a sense of humor.

The modernization of the church about which so many recently have opined is unlikely to make headlines soon. What is imperative is that the new pope be a strong communicator, or an ""Evangelical Catholic,"" as author and commentator George Weigel termed it. This means, among other things, adapting to the global news cycle.

This is no century for introverts.

The recently retired pope much preferred study and writing to meeting and greeting, his tweets notwithstanding. Efforts to humanize him via stories that he loved cats were somewhat outdated and mildly annoying. Worshipers seeking solidarity with the Vicar of Christ often sent Benedict photos of their cats. When a prominent television personality visited the pope, he gave Benedict a gift -- a Baccarat cat.

Benedict had no cats at the Vatican.

The church faces enormous challenges, obviously, but none so daunting as communicating the Good News, which translates to helping millions around the world. Whatever one's personal opinion of Catholicism (I am not Catholic), the church remains a bulwark against Western secularization and the growing culture of choice. Is it really desirable, just for starters, that the leader of the Christian church embrace the destruction of human life in the womb?

One may make painful, personal choices as the law permits, but even non-Catholics can find solace in the barricade that men and women of conscience erect between human beings and the abyss of relativity. If the church means nothing to some, it is at least a welcome noisemaker in the public square, fearless in making the argument that life does matter.

Without the Catholic Church -- the largest charitable organization in the world -- millions of the world's least fortunate would suffer. Catholic Relief Services works in nearly 100 countries and reaches 100 million of the world's poorest with emergency aid and health care, including 280 HIV and AIDS projects. Catholic Charities USA provided food services to 6.5 million people last year, according to Vatican sources.

Scandal surely has diminished the Vatican's moral authority, but 2,000 years of history suggest it will adapt and survive. In the meantime, any evaluation of its present situation must also include recognition of the immense good that individual Catholics and the church do.

NewsDay,Scientists: Baby born with HIV apparently cured,"WASHINGTON -- A baby born with the AIDS virus appears to have been cured, scientists announced yesterday, describing the case of a child from Mississippi who's now 2 and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection.

There's no guarantee the child will remain healthy, although sophisticated testing uncovered just traces of the virus' genetic material still lingering. If so, it would mark only the world's second reported cure.

Specialists say the announcement, at a major AIDS meeting in Atlanta, offers promising clues for efforts to eliminate HIV infection in children, especially in AIDS-plagued African countries where many babies are born with the virus.

""You could call this about as close to a cure, if not a cure, that we've seen,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told The Associated Press.

A doctor gave this baby faster and stronger treatment than is usual, starting a three-drug infusion within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV wasn't diagnosed until she was in labor.

""I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,"" said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi.

That fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby's blood before it could form hiding places in the body.

NewsDay,Editorial: Dr. C. Everett Koop let science guide his leadership,"Dr. C. Everett Koop taught Americans many things.

When President Ronald Reagan nominated him as U.S. surgeon general in 1981, liberals were incensed. Koop was known for his socially conservative views -- especially his opposition to abortion. A skeptical Senate held up his confirmation for months. But once in office, he surprised everyone.

His strong campaign against smoking earned him the enmity of tobacco-state conservatives. His frank talk about AIDS -- which in those days was a new and usually fatal disease -- shocked Americans of all kinds. While most politicians tried to avoid even mentioning AIDS, Koop was urging condom use and safer sex. And he refused to use his office as an anti-abortion soapbox. He didn't want his beliefs to interfere with his duties as the nation's top public health officer.

His approach worked. By the time Koop left office in 1989, smoking had dropped from 33 percent of Americans to 26 percent. Most Americans understood how the AIDS virus was transmitted and what precautions to take against it. If the culture wars were raging all around him, they were not raging because Koop fanned the flames.

Koop showed us that character is about more than angry labels, that sound science is the best way to serve humanity, and that ideology is a personal thing. He died Monday at 96, and his old-fashioned common sense, decency and open-mindedness will be missed.

In today's politics, ideology battles science to a stunning degree. Elections turn on notions about rape. Evolution remains a debatable idea in some parts of the country. And abortion has created a seemingly intractable gap in public opinion. The result is anger and deadlock. Koop -- who started as a pioneering pediatric surgeon -- was an evangelical Christian and a man of science. For him, this was a glorious mix, and it happened to make this nation, and maybe the world, a better place.",26/02/2013
NewsDay,"Feds: 46 percent of teens are sexually active, STDs on the rise","A recent government report contains an eye-opening statistic: 46 percent of high school students have had sexual intercourse and potentially are at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In fact, one in four sexually active teenagers has an STD.

The lead author, Ramin Bastani, of two CDC studies called it “an ongoing, severe STI epidemic.”

Nearly 50 percent of the 19 million new STD infections are diagnosed in people between the ages of 15 to 24, according to a CDC news release. “The CDC says significant reductions in new infections are not only possible, they're urgently needed.”

Parents can play a key role in educating children about STDs. Bastani also said technology is making it easier. He developed Qpid.me, a free, simple way to obtain, securely store and privately share STD results for teens as young as 13. Here's how it works: Go to a doctor or clinic and get tested, request and receive your STD results via online fax which are then stored on Qpid.me.

Here are some more surprising STD stats from the CDC:

* About one in three sexually active high school students did not use a condom during last sexual intercourse.

* Treating eight of the most common STI’s in a year costs the American health care system nearly $16 billion in direct medical costs alone.

* Gonorrhea in the United States has risen for the first time in decades and is now resistant to most antibiotics.

NewsDay,Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop dies at 96,"With his long silver beard and uniform with braided trim, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop became one of the most recognizable figures of the Reagan era -- and one of the most unexpectedly enduring.

Koop, who turned his once-obscure post into a bully pulpit for seven years during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, died Monday at his home in Hanover, N.H. He was 96.

His nomination in 1981 met a wall of opposition from women's groups and liberal politicians, who complained President Ronald Reagan selected Koop, a pediatric surgeon and evangelical Christian from Philadelphia, only because of his conservative views, especially his staunch opposition to abortion.

Soon, though, he was a hero to AIDS activists, who chanted ""Koop, Koop"" at his appearances but booed other officials. And when he left his post in 1989, he left behind a landscape where AIDS was a top research and educational priority, smoking was considered a public health hazard, and access to abortion remained largely intact.

In doing so, he surprised both ends of the political spectrum by setting aside his conservative personal views on issues such as homosexuality and abortion to keep his focus sharply medical.

An assistant at Koop's Dartmouth College institute, Susan Wills, confirmed his death but didn't disclose the cause.

Although the surgeon general has no real authority to set government policy, Koop described himself as ""the health conscience of the country"" and said modestly just before leaving his post that ""my only influence was through moral suasion."" A former pipe smoker, Koop carried out a crusade to end smoking in the United States; his goal had been to do so by 2000. He said cigarettes were as addictive as heroin and cocaine. And he shocked his conservative supporters when he endorsed condoms and sex education to stop the spread of AIDS.

""A lot of people don't realize what an important role he played in the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. At the time, he really changed the national conversation, and he showed real courage in pursuing the duties of his job,"" said Chris Collins, a vice president of amFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.

Even after leaving office, Koop continued to promote public health causes, from preventing childhood accidents to better training for doctors.

""I will use the written word, the spoken word and whatever I can in the electronic media to deliver health messages to this country as long as people will listen,"" he promised.

In 1996, he rapped Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole for suggesting that tobacco was not invariably addictive, saying Dole's comments ""either exposed his abysmal lack of knowledge of nicotine addiction or his blind support of the tobacco industry."" Although Koop eventually won wide respect with his blend of old-fashioned values, pragmatism and empathy, his nomination met staunch opposition.

Foes noted that Koop traveled the country in 1979 and 1980 giving speeches that predicted a progression ""from liberalized abortion to infanticide to passive euthanasia to active euthanasia, indeed to the very beginnings of the political climate that led to Auschwitz, Dachau and Belsen."" But Koop, a devout Presbyterian, was confirmed after he told a Senate panel he would not use the surgeon general's post to promote his religious ideology. He kept his word.

In 1986, he issued a frank report on AIDS, urging the use of condoms for ""safe sex"" and advocating sex education as early as third grade.

He also maneuvered around uncooperative Reagan administration officials in 1988 to send an educational AIDS pamphlet to more than 100 million U.S. households, the largest public health mailing ever.

Koop personally opposed homosexuality and believed sex should be saved for marriage. But he insisted that Americans, especially young people, must not die because they were deprived of explicit information about how HIV was transmitted.

Koop further angered conservatives by refusing to issue a report requested by the Reagan White House, saying he could not find enough scientific evidence to determine whether abortion has harmful psychological effects on women.

Koop maintained his personal opposition to abortion, however. After he left office, he told medical students it violated their Hippocratic oath. In 2009, he wrote to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, urging that health care legislation include a provision to ensure doctors and medical students would not be forced to perform abortions.

Koop served as chairman of the National Safe Kids Campaign and as an adviser to President Bill Clinton's health care reform plan.

At a congressional hearing in 2007, Koop spoke about political pressure on the surgeon general post. He said Reagan was pressed to fire him every day, but Reagan would not interfere.

Koop, worried that medicine had lost old-fashioned caring and personal relationships between doctors and patients, opened his institute at Dartmouth to teach medical students basic values and ethics.

Koop was born in Brooklyn, the only son of a Manhattan banker and the nephew of a doctor. He said by age 5 he knew he wanted to be a surgeon and at age 13 he practiced his skills on neighborhood cats.

Koop earned his medical degree at Cornell Medical College, choosing pediatric surgery because so few surgeons practiced it.",25/02/2013
NewsDay,"White House warns: Sequestration could cut funds for Sandy aid, Zadroga","WASHINGTON -- A total of $3 billion in hard-won federal funding for superstorm Sandy aid and $27 million for the 9/11 Zadroga health fund will be cut unless Congress acts to avoid automatic spending reductions by Friday, the White House and lawmakers said Sunday.

Those cuts would be in addition to $275 million in reductions to federal spending on military bases and civilian Department of Defense employees, social services, education, public health and environmental protection in New York State.

The effect of the automatic cuts, known in Washington as sequestration, was outlined in a state-by-state accounting for the first time Sunday by the White House.

""This will have macroeconomic consequences, cost hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, and jobs throughout the private sector,"" White House economic adviser Jason Furman said. ""This will have serious programmatic consequences for all 50 states.""

As the March 1 deadline for a resolution nears, the White House has released more detailed reports of what would happen if under the sequestration law enacted in 2011 the government must cut $85 billion in discretionary spending in the seven months remaining in this fiscal year.

Congressional Democrats and Republicans oppose the cuts, but remain far apart about how to resolve the issue and blame it on each other.

""Long Island's economy will take a major hit if sequestration happens -- including the Sandy aid we fought so hard to get -- and it's a hit we can avoid,"" said Rep. Steve Israel (D-Huntington).

He called on Republicans to allow closing tax loopholes for the wealthy to raise $40 billion to lower the deficit.

Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) said President Barack Obama should hold a summit to resolve the issue and stop trying to ""score campaign points.""

""He needs to show more leadership,"" King said.

If the deadline passes without an agreement from both sides, some cuts would take effect immediately, while others would be phased in over time. Congress could go back later and restore the funding, according to several lawmakers.

Under the sequester, the $51 billion Sandy Relief Act would be slashed by $3 billion through a 9 percent cut in its programs, said Danny Werfel, controller in the White House budget office.

""What you will see is a systematic reduction in all of the activities for Sandy relief that were funded. The $3 billion in reduction will be spread across a variety of different program areas,"" he said.

Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano, a Republican, called for bipartisan cooperation. ""Hurricane Sandy victims will be unable to rebuild their lives without the critical aid,"" he said.

Suffolk Executive Steve Bellone a Democrat, agreed. ""Those residents and businesses affected by Super Storm Sandy need and want to rebuild,"" he wrote in a statement Sunday. ""It is important to ensure that the original amount of approved funds are available to those affected. I urge both parties to come together and do what is right for all Americans.""

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund also would take a hit, losing $1 billion, but administration officials said there would be no immediate cuts to anyone receiving individual assistance.

The $4 billion 9/11 Zadroga Health and Compensation Act, enacted in 2011 to fund health monitoring and financial aid to sick Ground Zero workers, would be cut as well, with $17 million sliced from the Victims Compensation Fund and $10 million from the health fund through the end of September, said Glen Caplin, spokesman for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). ""We must come together to prevent these devastating and indiscriminate cuts from going into effect that will do great harm to our economy and New York families, including Hurricane Sandy victims and 9/11 first responders,"" Gillibrand said.

King said he and Gillibrand will try to pass legislation to exempt the Zadroga funds.

The White House list of $275 million in other cuts to New York State includes $108 million in reductions in operations at Army bases and $60.9 million from furloughs of 12,000 civilian Defense Department workers.

The furloughs would affect 190 people -- and cut nearly $1.5 million -- from the Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing at Francis S. Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach, the Air Force said.

Other cuts would include nearly $80 million for primary and secondary education, programs for disabled children and Head Start.

Funding also would be cut for public health programs -- including a $2.7 million cut from HIV testing -- law enforcement and $12.9 million for environmental protection.

Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale, said funding already is too low and ""any more cuts and you're risking public health and our economy.""

NewsDay,BY JANET McCONNAUGHEY,"KEITHVILLE, La. -- For the first time in their lives, four aging chimpanzees once used in federal research can go outside whenever they like.

They can lie on the grass, clamber onto a platform 20 feet up on a chimp-style jungle gym and gaze freely at the open sky, the vista unbroken by steel bars.

Fifty-two-year-olds Julius and Sandy, 46-year-old Phyllis and 44-year-old Jessica have arrived. These and other primates are now ""living like chimpanzees"" as they play, groom each other and tussle at Chimp Haven in northwest Louisiana -- the only national sanctuary for retired federal research chimps.

Julius' group is among 111 chimpanzees coming to Chimp Haven over the next 18 months from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's New Iberia Research Center. They could be the vanguard of a much larger immigration of former research chimps on the way to the refuge in Keithville, La.

A National Institutes of Health committee recommended Jan. 22 that most of the other 350 federally owned research chimpanzees be retired to ""the federal sanctuary system"" -- a system of one. The agency's director will decide whether to accept the recommendations after a 60-day period for public comment.

The proposal to retire all but about 50 federally owned chimpanzees is the latest step in a gradual shift away from using chimps as test subjects, owing to technological advances and growing ethical concerns about research on primates that share more than 98 percent of the DNA of humans. Research on the chimps has ranged from psychological studies to trying to develop vaccines for HIV and hepatitis.

The arrivals are staggered so the small staff can integrate small groups of newcomers with old-timers at Chimp Haven, which opened in 2005.

The newcomers led by Julius were among nine that arrived Jan. 22. Another seven arrived later that week and eight more Tuesday.

New arrivals spend 17 days in quarantine before being moved into an indoor bedroom area near a bedroom occupied by chimps already settled into the sanctuary, to see how they get along.

Their first outdoor time is in one of two grassy, quarter-acre play yards that open onto the bedrooms. A network of steel mesh tunnels lets the staff move chimps from any part of the sanctuary to any other.

Staffers say it's amazing to see them savor new freedoms.

""They light up, look up at the sky, look at us watching them,"" behaviorist Amy Fultz said.

Like most newcomers to Chimp Haven, Julius' group first explored the edges of its new surroundings. Their play yards are surrounded by a high concrete wall that can't be climbed, and the larger areas of dense pine forest by similar concrete walls and, on one side, a moat.

Chimps in the wild make regular perimeter patrols, alert for encroaching bands and for a chance to expand their territory.

These retirees will spend the rest of their lives at the 200-acre sanctuary in a forested park belonging to the Caddo Parish government, which donated the land to Chimp Haven.

The habitats of 3 to 5 acres are populated by dense stands of pines where the primates can nest high in the trees.

Two other groups of recent arrivals from the university lab in New Iberia are getting acquainted with each other because each includes a youngster. The aim is to meld them and other groups with juveniles into a group with Chimp Haven's three ""oops"" babies, all sired by Conan, who has been at Chimp Haven for years.

On Tuesday, Conan's crowd was in a play area, catching fruit thrown by staffers. A female named Sheila slapped her hands together and held up an arm to attract attention.

A few minutes' walk away, another group of 15 chimps raced from the steel mesh tunnel between their sleeping area and a 5-acre forested habitat toward an array of fruits and vegetables strewn on the ground. Some grabbed a hoard of bananas, apples and oranges before starting to munch; others ate immediately.

After a bit, several turned to a tall, pointed structure with PVC pipes stuck in it -- an imitation termite mound. In the wild, chimps poke sticks into termite mounds to pull out insects to eat. At Chimp Haven, the tubes may hold honey-coated bits of fruit or sugar-free candy, inducing the great apes to use tools as they would in the wild.

Fultz said some newcomers won't even step on the grass in the play yards, but Julius' group had no qualms.

""They sit and look around. They look up at the sky. To me, they seem to be thinking, 'There's no bars,' "" Fultz said.",23/02/2013

NewsDay,"Knicks' Steve Novak, James White come up short on All-Star Saturday","HOUSTON -- Steve Novak started fast in the three-point contest but cooled off at the worst time. James White was creative in the dunk contest but couldn't finish his dunks.

Both Knicks were considered contenders in their respective events on All-Star Saturday, but neither reached the finals of their two-round contests.

Cleveland's Kyrie Irving beat San Antonio's Matt Bonner in the finals, 23-20, to win the three-point shootout. Toronto rookie Terrence Ross won the dunk contest, dethroning 2012 champ Jeremy Evans in the final.

White, whose nickname is ""Flight,"" came out for his first dunk with the flight crew. He ran past a group of flight attendants and took off from the foul line but missed the one-handed dunk. On his second try, White left from just outside the dotted circle and successfully threw it down with two hands. The judges gave him 45 points.

""I thought the crowd liked it,"" he said. ""I tried to get the crowd involved. It was pretty cool.""

On his second attempt, White lost the ball once and missed six dunk tries. He got a score of 32. ""I couldn't really grip the ball,"" he said. ""I couldn't get it where I wanted it.""

Novak had the same problem. After hitting eight of his first 10 shots, including the two-point money ball on both racks for 10 points, he said he thought he was going to score ""26 or 28 points.""

But he misfired on 10 of his last 15 and ended up with 17 points, one behind Irving.

""I shot the ball poorly and I don't deserve to win,"" Novak said. ""It's disappointing. It's the lowest round I had in the last two weeks of shooting.""

Novak is a much better shooter from the corner and the wing, and when he got to the third rack -- straightaway -- he struggled, going 1-for-5.

On the last two racks, from the wing and the corner, Novak was 2-for-5 and made the money ball on both. Novak's 17 points were fourth best of his round.

No Knick has ever finished higher than fourth in the three-point contest.

Then Stern turned serious and sincere when he discussed his fondest memory from his 29 previous All-Star Games as commissioner: presenting Magic Johnson the MVP trophy in 1992 in Orlando, three months after Johnson retired because he had HIV.

""Giving sweaty Magic Johnson a big hug right after he hit the last three and still being able to hug him, because he's alive every time I see him,"" Stern said. ""That is at the top of the list . . . That one will resonate for the rest of my life.""

Stern is retiring Feb. 1, 2014, and will be replaced by deputy commissioner Adam Silver.

NewsDay,Shiitake Happens to Protect You from Cancer,"Dear Pharmacist, I’m not a fan of fungus, but I’ve heard that shiitake mushrooms are good for cancer. What do you think? --C.E., Boston



I think some mushrooms are amazing! Shiitake, known botanically as Lentinula edodes, are seriously great for immune function. They’re not just a Japanese delicacy, these mushrooms have been used for centuries, and have a safe history of healing that goes back thousands of years. Chinese medicine traditionally uses mushrooms to enhance chi (pronounced “chee” which refers to your vital life force). We are not talking portobello though, this is altogether different.

Shiitake extracts definitely support immune function, but they also appear to have antiviral (even influenza), antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Ironic that fungus fights fungus, but it’s basically the good fungus (shiitake) killing the pathogenic ones. The 2009 study published in Complimentary Therapies in Clinical Practice had data to show that shiitake had “extensive antimicrobial activity against 85% of the organisms it was tested on, including 50% of the yeast and mold species in the trial.” This study even compared it to ciprofloxacin, a popular antibiotic. I found a trial suggesting antiviral effects against HIV as well as proliferation of leukemia. The activity was due to “lentin” an antifungal compound found in shiitake.

Is the study tight enough for you to go off your current treatment? No way, but it’s worth including in your regimen, with your doctor’s blessings. Researchers isolated a substance called “lentinan” in shiitake that sparks your own immune system to do a better job at getting rid of cancer cells. Researchers conclude that lentinan helps “prolong the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer.” In another Japanese study, published in Cancer & Chemotherapy, July 2012, researchers looking at shiitake’s effects on liver cancer suggested that the mushrooms “might be used for alleviating side effects of chemotherapy and preventing the progression of liver cancer for patients with chronic hepatitis.”

Shiitake is active against the hepatitis B virus, so you might say this is a liver-loving mushroom in many ways. It protects the colon too. Over 10 years ago, a study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that lentinan was “able to retard the development of tumors” in mice. In fact, they said, “significant regression in tumor formation was observed.” Remarkable.

Many studies have found that shiitake mushrooms are helpful for everyday ailments. For example, some research shows that shiitake may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, and lower blood pressure. Did I mention that shiitake mushrooms are a natural source of protein and vitamin D? Both are important for immunity. Shiitake mushrooms taste good, I add them to my jasmine rice along with pure saffron, turmeric, onions, grapeseed oil and garlic. Yum. There are excellent supplements/extracts of Shitake sold at health food stores, and you can also buy multi-tasking formulas which contain several different medicinal mushrooms. Those are a little harder to find, two good ones are MycoPhyto by Econugenics or Mushroom Optimizer by Jarrow.",16/02/2013
NewsDay,CDC: Sex diseases cost $16B to treat each year,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Sexually transmitted diseases cost $16 billion each year to treat in the United States, with 19.7 million infections diagnosed annually, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found.

People ages 15 to 24 account for half of the annual cases, according to reports issued Wednesday by the CDC. There are about 110 million total infections among U.S. men and women of all ages, the agency said, with the most common infection human papillomavirus, a virus linked to cancer.

Young people have borne a disproportionate burden of sexually transmitted diseases for as long as the Atlanta-based CDC has kept records, said Catherine Satterwhite, an author of one of the reports. They often don't have good insurance or difficulties accessing care, she said.

""Young women in particular are at greater risk,"" Satterwhite said.

The CDC reported data on eight sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, herpes and HPV.

The data from 2008, the most recent comprehensive data available, isn't directly comparable with previous studies because of changes in the reporting methods. Some trends, including that of younger patients, persist, however.

All sexually transmitted diseases are preventable, many are curable and all are treatable, Satterwhite said. Getting people tested more appropriately, such as making sure more young women are screened for chlamydia and all sexually active adults are tested for HIV would help, she said.

NewsDay,"Letter: Kids need health lessons, examples","In response to ""Elevate health class in grade school"" [Letters, Jan. 24], I applaud the writer's insight and concern about the state of our children's health, where it seems to be heading, and the need for serious intervention and education to prevent a future population of unhealthy, unproductive adults.

However, here is some good news to share, especially with those whose children attend one of 50 schools in Suffolk County where teachers have been trained to provide the HealthSmart program. This is comprehensive health education for kindergarten through grade 12 provided by the Office of Health Education in the Suffolk County Department of Health Services' Division of Preventive Medicine.

The HealthSmart curriculum is based on recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control. It addresses the most risky behaviors that can lead to morbidity and mortality in children and adolescents: tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, as well as issues of poor nutrition, self-inflicted injuries, mental health, bullying, unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, and lack of physical activity.

Mental health lessons help children identify stressors, seek help when needed and recognize problem behaviors -- so important in light of recent school tragedies.

More than 2,500 teachers are using all or parts of this curriculum, and information is sent home to enable parents to discuss these important lessons with their children. The lessons learned in school must be reinforced at home. It is up to us, as parents, to make sure that lessons for good health remain a constant in our children's lives by our good example.

NewsDay,R.A. Dickey in Mumbai to help end sexual exploitation,"R.A. Dickey said the pictures and literature couldn't have prepared him for the young boy who approached him last week on one of the squalid streets of Mumbai's red-light district.

The boy was maybe 3 years old, 4 at best. He had no pants on. His body was covered with open sores.

""He was playing amongst the open sewage and filth with rats as big as dogs. Unsupervised,"" the Toronto Blue Jays' new knuckleballer told The Canadian Press on a conference call Tuesday from India's most populous city. ""You see these images and pictures that just don't seem like they should exist. And you hope that it's the only one ... but that's what's representative, these lives that just don't have a voice.""

The 38-year-old is in Mumbai to work with Bombay Teen Challenge, a Christian organization that has rescued women and children from sex trafficking for the past 23 years.

It's a cause that Dickey says speaks to his own narrative. He wrote about being sexually abused as a child in his autobiography ""Wherever I Wind Up: My Quest for Truth, Authenticity and the Perfect Knuckleball.""

""It's authentic to me because of my past experience, also I have a sentimentality to it because the girls that I've seen firsthand in the streets, these 19-, 20-, 21-year-old girls. You have to look beyond that and see at one point they were daughters themselves, and having two daughters ... that just for me was so compelling.""

He made the trip with his daughters, 11-year-old Gabriel and 9-year-old Lila.

""I want to give my children a heart for humanity,"" Dickey said. ""The only way to really do that is to get them outside of the bubble that they live in, and expose them in very measured ways to what real life is to a lot of people. They've responded beautifully.""

The 2012 NL Cy Young winner said it's been ""a roller-coaster"" visit, from the visceral red-light images of women in doorways and the cages where they keep them when they're first trafficked.

But he also saw hope.

Dickey and his daughters stayed at Ashagram, a rehabilitation campus outside Mumbai that's home to 300 women and children. They were the ""most hopeful days"" of the trip. They played cricket and sang songs with the children, many of whom are HIV positive.

""Those are the miracles, the 300 lives in Ashagram, those are 300 living miracles,"" Dickey said. ""Sure (my daughters) heard about the wickedness and the darkness, but they got to actually see the redemption, so their response has been really positive. This is a seminal trip for them.""

Dickey, who speaks openly with his daughters about his own sexual abuse, helped celebrate the opening of a clinic in the midst of Mumbai's red-light district. He helped pay for the clinic, raising over $100,000 by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last winter.

""The facility is like a beacon of light in the middle of a swamp,"" he said.

BTC's Thomason Varghese said the organization was blessed by Dickey's presence.

""But we think we've been even more blessed by his daughters,"" Varghese said. ""Just to see innocent girls loving our girls and playing with them with no inhibitions, it's just been a real joy for us to see and experience. There are friendships that have come through this despite how different their backgrounds are.

""Today the girls were in our feeding truck serving food to those who are coming from the street, just watching that was a sight to see.""

While estimates of sex trafficking in India vary, most studies put the number at more than a million children involved in the country's sex trade.

Dickey was asked how can one measure success in the face of such grim statistics.

""If the organization rescues one human life from that hell, then it's done its job in some way,"" Dickey said. ""You're talking over the last 23 years over 1,000 lives being rescued, given a second chance to have a life, rescuing children, people who were left for dead on doorsteps of these brothels. . .

""The women who had been trafficked into prostitution, dying in hospitals with their children by their bed, here's the Bombay Teen Challenge with a relationship in place to be able to take in and care for these children.

""How do you measure success? I think it's one life at a time.""",30/01/2013
NewsDay,"Sundance winners include 'Fruitvale,' 'Blood Brother'","PARK CITY, Utah - The dramatic film ""Fruitvale"" and the documentary ""Blood Brother"" won over audiences and Sundance Film Festival judges.

Both American films won audience awards and grand jury prizes Saturday at the Sundance Awards.

""Fruitvale"" is based on the true story of Oscar Grant, who was 22 years old when he was shot and killed in a public transit station in Oakland, Calif. First-time filmmaker Ryan Coogler wrote and directed the dramatic narrative.

""This project was about humanity, about human beings and how we treat each other; how we treat the people that we love the most, and how we treat the people that we don't know,"" the 26-year-old said as he accepted the final prize of the night. ""To get this award means that it had a profound impact on the audience that saw it, on the people that were responsible for picking it up. And this goes back to my home, to the Bay Area, where Oscar Grant lived, breathed, slept, loved, fought, had fun and survived for 22 years.""

Fox Searchlight founder and Sundance juror Tom Rothman said ""Fruitvale"" was recognized for ""its skillful realization, its devastating emotional impact and its moral and social urgency — and for anyone out there who thinks for one second that movies don't matter and can't make a difference in the world.

""This will not be the last time you guys walk to a podium,"" he added.

Coogler said he felt personally connected to the story because he's from Oakland and was born the same year as the subject of his film.

""So I'm the same age, same demographic. So when I saw the footage, initially I was heartbroken, frustrated, and the biggest thing was that Oscar looked like us, you know what I mean?"" he said. ""He looked like any one of my friends — could have been me, could have been them, and these situations happen again and again.""

The U.S. documentary winner, ""Blood Brother,"" follows a young American, Rocky Braat, who moved to India to work with orphans infected with HIV.

""This means so much to so many kids,"" director Steve Hoover said as he accepted the award.

Other dramatic winners at the ceremony, hosted by actor-director Joseph Gordon-Levitt, included Lake Bell, who accepted the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award for her directorial debut, ""In A World,"" and Jill Soloway, who won the directing award for her feature debut, ""Afternoon Delight.""

Soloway thanked Bell and the other ""lady directors"" making their debuts at the festival.

""I feel like we all crossed the street together holding hands,"" she said. ""We're all out there together exposing ourselves, and I love being here with you guys.""

Cinematographer Bradford Young was recognized for his work in two dramatic films, ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" and ""Mother of George.""

Documentary winners included Zachary Heinzerling for directing ""Cutie and the Boxer"" and Matthew Hamachek for editing ""Gideon's Army.""

The Cambodian film ""A River Changes Course"" won the grand jury prize for international documentary, and a narrative film from South Korea, ""Jiseul,"" claimed the grand jury prize for dramatic world cinema.

Having a film at Sundance serves as a stamp of approval, Coogler said.

""Audiences trust this film festival more than any other festival in the country,"" he said, ""and they know if a film plays here, it's a film that should be seen.""",27/01/2013
NewsDay,State recovered $335M from Medicaid fraud,"ALBANY -- The state attorney general's office recovered more than $335 million last year from Medicaid fraud and abuse, the agency reported yesterday.

The total, including $146 million from a multistate settlement with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, is the second highest annual recovery by the office's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.

One of the unit's most notable victories last year was shutting down a scheme to distribute black market prescription HIV drugs through Long Island-based MOMS Pharmacy, which billed Medicaid more than $155 million. The case is ongoing.

Budget documents show New York spending nearly $54 billion for Medicaid in the 2012-2013 fiscal year. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office said there's no clear guidance on how much Medicaid billing is typically fraudulent.

Typical frauds include medical providers billing for services they never gave, double billing Medicaid and private insurers, phantom patient visits and falsifying symptoms or diagnoses to bill for unnecessary services and tests, according to the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units. Schneiderman credited added prosecutors, investigators and auditors for boosting the fraud unit.-- AP",23/01/2013

NewsDay,Bessent: America's puzzling 'health disadvantage',"Being American is hazardous to your health. We die younger and suffer more illness and injury than people in the world's other affluent nations and have the worst odds of living to age 50.

That ""health disadvantage"" can't be explained away by the usual suspects of poverty and race. It doesn't matter if you're white, insured, have a college education and earn a good living. It doesn't matter that the United States spends more per person on health care than any other nation. Even being young doesn't make you immune. The disadvantage exists from birth to age 75. And it's been getting worse for three decades. The way we live is killing us.

That's the unhappy finding reported last week by a panel from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council convened by the National Institutes of Health to shed light on the problem.

""We are struck by the gravity of these findings,"" said Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University and the chairman of the panel that compared life expectancy and health in the United States with data from 16 peer nations, including Canada, Japan, Australia and a number in Western Europe.

The United States fared worst, or close to it, in mortality rates, injuries and homicides, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and AIDS, drug-related deaths, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease and disability. Over the past century, Americans' life expectancy and health have improved. But that improvement has lagged behind other nations.

So what is it about how we live that's killing, maiming and making us sick? No single factor can explain it. But it seems the freewheeling lifestyle we cherish enables behaviors that are bad for our health.

Americans are more likely to live in communities like Long Island that are built around automobiles. That frees us to live where we want, but it also discourages physical activity and contributes to obesity. Devil-may-care Americans are also less likely to use seat belts than motorists in other nations. And we have more traffic accidents that involve alcohol.

Americans notoriously eat more than people in other countries. More of us abuse drugs. And we do love our right to guns, which we're more likely to use in lethal acts of violence against others and sometimes ourselves.

Americans do enjoy some health advantages. We're less likely to smoke and we imbibe alcohol more judiciously than others. We have lower death rates from cancer and stroke. And lucky Americans who make it to age 75 can expect to live longer than people in other countries who reach that marker. But overall, the picture is pretty bleak.

Shorter lives and poorer health harm the nation's economy as health care costs rise and a sicker workforce compromises our ability to compete.

So, what to do?

Being academics, members of the panel recommend more data collection and study. And they call for an outreach campaign to alert the public to this health disadvantage and stimulate a discussion about its implications. That's sensible. The first step to solving a problem is knowing there is one.

Governments can help too. Tighter restrictions to keep guns out of the hands of violent people, like those to be debated soon in Congress, would help. So would tougher laws to keep chronic drunken drivers off the road. We may have to get over our aversion to ""nanny-state"" anti-obesity initiatives, such as taxes on sugary drinks. And we should invest more to expand mass transit to draw people out of their cars.

But, ultimately, changing lifestyle is personal. It's less an issue of figuring out what to do than of creating the resolve to do it.

NewsDay,Reused insulin pens putvets at risk in Buffalo,"The Associated Press

BUFFALO -- More than 700 patients at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Center may have been exposed to HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C because of the accidental reuse of insulin pens, according to a hospital statement and published reports.

Authorities told The Buffalo News there is a ""very small risk"" for the diabetic patients who may have been exposed to the reused insulin pens between Oct. 19, 2010, and November 2012.

The VA also notified western New York members of Congress of the possible exposure.

In a statement to The Associated Press, VA spokeswoman Evangeline Conley said the hospital ""recently discovered that, in some cases, insulin pens were not labeled for individual patients."" She added that ""although the pen needles were always changed, an insulin pen may have been used on more than one patient.""

Conley said that once this was discovered the hospital took ""immediate action"" to ensure the insulin pens were being used according to pharmaceutical guidelines. The VA said it is offering free blood tests to rule out any infections.",14/01/2013
NewsDay,Occupy Wall Street protester sues NYPD officer,"An Occupy Wall Street protester who was caught on videotape getting punched in the head by an NYPD deputy inspector filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and the officer on Thursday.

The demonstrator, Felix Rivera-Pitre, 37, said in the excessive force complaint that videos widely distributed on the Internet show that he was ""sucker-punched"" and knocked out without provocation by Dep. Insp. Johnny Cardona during an Oct. 14, 2011 march.

""The force of the blow knocked Mr. Rivera-Pitre to the ground and ripped the earring from his ear, tearing his left earlobe and creating a pool of blood,"" said the suit. "" . . . Cardona continued to strike and/or kick Mr. Rivera-Pitre as he lay semiconscious on the asphalt.""

As the incident gained notoriety in 2011, police alleged that Rivera-Pitre had tried to elbow Cardona in the head. But he was never charged, and eventually met with the Manhattan district attorney's office to file a complaint against the officer.

The district attorney's investigation of Cardona has never been resolved -- the same posture as another notorious Occupy Wall Street incident that drew wide interest on the Internet in 2011, the pepper-spraying of several protesters without obvious provocation by Dep. Inspector Anthony Bologna. Bologna was disciplined by the NYPD, but the district attorney still has his case under review.

Rivera-Pitre's Manhattan lawyers, Ron Kuby and Lea Speiss, criticized Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance for failing to take action in 15 months. ""If Cy Vance is looking for a New Year's resolution,"" Speiss said, ""this should be it.""

The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit, and Vance's office declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the city law department said, ""We will review the papers upon receipt.""

Roy Richter, president of the NYPD's Captains Endowment Association, described Cardona as a ""well-respected senior officer,"" and said his ""actions were appropriate given the situation at hand.""

The lawsuit does not quantify the damages sought. But it alleges that Rivera-Pitre, who is an HIV-positive activist from Queens, suffered lacerations, bruises and intense pain in his jaw, as well as ""humiliation, fear, anxiety and embarrassment.""",10/01/2013

NewsDay,EXCERPT: 'Rise to Greatness',"Prologue: ""SO MUCH WAS ALL COMPRESSED""

The year began with a day so warm and fine that only the calendar said January. There would be few pleasant moments in 1862, but New Year's Day in Washington, D.C., was one of them. Everyone was out enjoying the sunshine that morning -- women in demure bonnets, men wishing they had left their overcoats at home, children dodging and shouting. The dusty streets of the half-built city were filled with people making their way toward the White House, where, by tradition, the president threw open the doors on the first day of each year.

Never had there been so large a crowd. The capital had doubled in size in the previous six months and was rapidly doubling again, as young men by the tens of thousands poured into Washington to join the Army of the Potomac. In April 1861, when war broke out between North and South, the entire U.S. Army numbered about 16,000 men, spread in little garrisons across the continent. By November, nearly five times that number, some 75,000 troops, could be mustered in a single field outside Washington for a presidential review. The ranking U.S. general planned to lead a column of more than a quarter of a million troops against the rebellious South.

Everywhere one looked in the capital, there were soldiers and more soldiers, brimming with zeal, eager for action, ignorant of war. They filled camps covering miles of hillsides in all directions. By day, the untested warriors marched and drilled, or cut logs and dug trenches to ring the capital with forts and firing pits. By night, some crowded into slapdash saloons and boardinghouse brothels. This instant army, like a great magnet, attracted regiments of merchants, job seekers, journalists, do-gooders, adventurers, spies, thieves, and would-be war contractors. A dull, swampy city was transformed in weeks into an overcrowded hive of patriotism, opportunism, and paranoia.

On the new year's first morning, multitudes packed themselves into the blocks around the Executive Mansion, flowing down wooden sidewalks and dirt streets onto Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington's only paved thoroughfare. There, the clip-clop of horseshoes and clanking of swords signaled the passage of freshly minted officers in full regalia: gold braid, white gloves, yellow sashes, obsidian boots. Carriage wheels rattled and friends called greetings, while somewhere in the distance, a Marine band blared martial music. Directly north of the White House, in the grand town houses around Lafayette Square, servants hurried to finish polishing the silver and laying out refreshments, for it was also tradition that the owners of these houses -- cabinet members and sea captains and confidants of presidents past and present -- would open their own doors.

The New Year's Day open house was a ritual of democracy in the spirit of Andrew Jackson, whose statue, atop a rearing horse, adorned the center of Lafayette Square. On this one day, everyone was welcome in the halls of power, from statesmen to workingmen, from consuls to clerks, from the Roman-nosed senator Orville Hickman Browning to the scoundrel who picked Browning's pocket. It was ""the greatest jam ever witnessed on any similar occasion,"" one newspaper correspondent observed. The people of Washington, it seemed, had somehow agreed for a few hours to forget their desperate situation and celebrate a new beginning.

Absent the holiday exuberance, however, a cool assessment of the country's present circumstances would show that the American republic was in grave danger. The hope that secession fever would burn itself out was being trampled in the rush to battle stations. Strategies for reviving pro-Union sentiments in the South were stymied by the sheer size of the breakaway Confederate States of America, which covered an expanse larger than the entire European territory conquered by Napoleon. A pocket of loyalists in western Virginia had been liberated the previous summer by Union troops marching eastward from Ohio, but the pro-Union population of the more remote Appalachian Mountains, in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, was scarcely reachable down long dirt roads through hostile territory. Elsewhere in Dixie, what Union sentiment survived was scattered and cowed. The Confederacy was in the process of mobilizing a greater percentage of its population as soldiers than any European power had ever achieved. Those troops were led by some of the most experienced military men on the North American continent, starting with Confederate president Jefferson Davis, a West Point graduate, combat veteran, and former U.S. secretary of war.

The Confederacy also wielded a powerful economic weapon: near total control of the global cotton supply, at a time when textiles were driving the industrial revolution and cotton was perhaps the world's most important commodity. The cotton embargo enforced by rebel leaders was a gun to the heads of the British and French governments, putting tremendous pressure on them to support Southern independence. Pressure aside, the idea that the Confederacy -- now a powerful country in its own right -- could be tamed and forced back into the Union by an army of raw volunteers, led by an unschooled frontier lawyer as commander in chief, struck most European observers as far-fetched, even preposterous. ""It is in the highest Degree likely that the North will not be able to subdue the South,"" the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, counseled his Foreign Office.

Such skepticism was reinforced by conditions on the ground. Rebel soldiers menaced Washington from nearby Manassas, Virginia, where they had routed a Union army a few months earlier. Jefferson Davis was weighing a campaign into Maryland to stir up secessionists and cut off the capital from the North. Confederate artillery commanded the Potomac River above and below the capital, effectively sealing the waterway. No one in civilian authority had any detailed knowledge of the plans being prepared by the Union's top general, George B. McClellan; worse, McClellan was ill and rumored to be dying.

The federal government, meanwhile, appeared overwhelmed. The president was increasingly seen as feckless and inadequate. Congress was in the hands of a political party that had never governed before. The Treasury Department was broke, yet federal spending was multiplying as never before; in 1862, the government would spend six times as much as in 1861. (Northern banks, fearing a panic by demoralized investors, had closed their exchange windows, refusing to redeem paper money with gold or silver.) The War Department was a corrupt shambles, its chief on the verge of being fired. Despairing State Department envoys to Britain and France believed that the great powers were aligned against their besieged government; it appeared to be only a matter of time before Europe would intervene to settle the conflict in favor of the Confederacy. A rebel diplomat crowed from London, ""At present there is a probability that our recognition by her Britannic Majesty's Government will not be much longer delayed."" President Davis considered European intervention almost inevitable, and he shaped his strategies around that confidence.

To the east of the White House, at the far end of that lone paved avenue, stood the unfinished U.S. Capitol, darkly crowned by the cast-iron skeleton of an enormous dome. To the south of the mansion, across a fetid bog, rose the sad stump of the Washington Monument, abandoned for lack of funds. These uncompleted projects were silent reminders that great things had been planned in this city, and large dreams dreamt. The boldest of all the American dreams was the vision of a great new nation that would span the continent, dominate the hemisphere, and rival any country on earth. This dream of one nation indivisible, from sea to shining sea, was the true prize at stake in the terrible months ahead.",31/12/2012
NewsDay,Miss Universe Olivia Culpo says win shows confidence is all,"LAS VEGAS - The 20-year-old Rhode Islander who brought the Miss Universe crown back to the U.S. for the first time in 15 years is hoping that her quick rise through the beauty contest ranks and an onstage stumble will show women that anything is possible.

Perched high above the Las Vegas Strip in the Planet Hollywood winner's suite Thursday, Olivia Culpo told The Associated Press that her yearlong transformation from Boston University sophomore to pageant winner proves that women can accomplish anything to which they set their minds.

""My first pageant was a year ago and already I'm Miss Universe. It's kind of incredible,"" she said.

She pointed to the fact that she stumbled on her red velvet evening dress Wednesday night before beating out beauty queens from 88 countries as proof that confidence and poise matter more than perfect performance.

""I like the fact that I tripped last night in my evening gown. I think that that's cool,"" she said. ""And you learn from it: Don't step on your dress,"" she added with a laugh.

The former Miss USA spent the first day of her reign surrounded by stylists and handlers, wearing a scarlet mini-dress with cutout cap sleeves and sky-high silver heels. Plates of cupcakes and croissants went untouched as she sipped from a water bottle with a straw.

For the past six months, Culpo has shared a New York City apartment with outgoing Miss Universe, Leila Lopes of Angola. The two titleholders traditionally room together.

Her coronation ended a long losing spell for the U.S. in the competition. An American had not won the Miss Universe title since Miss Hawaii, Brook Lee, won in 1997.

A middle child of five, Culpo was studying theater and communications at Boston University when she decided to enroll in the Miss Rhode Island pageant last year to improve her stage presence.

The petite brunette ended up winning that contest in a rented $20 dress with a hole in the back. She claimed the Miss USA crown in the spring, despite losing an earring during the interview portion.

Culpo said she studied world events, prepared for interview questions and memorized proper walking and posing techniques using stacks of flashcards.

The aspiring actress took a year off from Boston University to fulfill the travel and charity obligations that come along with the Miss USA crown, and now says she will not return to her former college.

""I do want to finish my education,"" she said. ""I just don't think that Boston has a big enough market for what I want to do.""

As Miss Universe, Culpo will advocate for HIV prevention, the official platform of the title holder, but does not intend to speak out on other issues.

She did have a word for the ""pageant moms"" who have caught the nation's attention on reality television shows such as TLC's ""Toddlers & Tiaras.""

""If you think that your child is going to be really sensitive to the fact that they might not win -- which they probably won't -- you shouldn't do it because it's not healthy if they get the feeling that they're not good enough or they're not worthy,"" she said.

Culpo's mother, a professional viola player, discouraged her from entering the world of beauty competitions last year.

""I didn't see the point; I thought it was silly and a waste of time,"" Susan Culpo said. But she changed her mind when she saw the joy her daughter brought to hometown fans.

On Thursday, the mayor of Culpo's home town of Cranston, R.I., called her win an inspiration for the city, state and nation.

Asked moments before the Miss Universe show why pageants remain relevant, Donald Trump, who co-owns the competition with NBC, responded that everyone likes beautiful women.

His winner had a different take:

""It really comes down to being able to inspire others by being comfortable with yourself. You have to show girls that everyone is different, everyone has things they don't like, but they work it and walk the runway,"" Culpo said. ""There is no ideal body. It's just taking what you have and working it.""",20/12/2012
NewsDay,"Study: People worldwide living longer, but sicker","LONDON - Nearly everywhere around the world, people are living longer and fewer children are dying. But increasingly, people are grappling with the diseases and disabilities of modern life, according to the most expansive global look so far at life expectancy and the biggest health threats.

The last comprehensive study was in 1990 and the top health problem then was the death of children under 5 — more than 10 million each year. Since then, campaigns to vaccinate kids against diseases like polio and measles have reduced the number of children dying to about 7 million.

Malnutrition was once the main health threat for children. Now, everywhere except Africa, they are much more likely to overeat than to starve.

With more children surviving, chronic illnesses and disabilities that strike later in life are taking a bigger toll, the research said. High blood pressure has become the leading health risk worldwide, followed by smoking and alcohol.

""The biggest contributor to the global health burden isn't premature (deaths), but chronic diseases, injuries, mental health conditions and all the bone and joint diseases,"" said one of the study leaders, Christopher Murray, director of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

In developed countries, such conditions now account for more than half of the health problems, fueled by an aging population. While life expectancy is climbing nearly everywhere, so too are the number of years people will live with things like vision or hearing loss and mental health issues like depression.

The research appears in seven papers published online Thursday by the journal Lancet. More than 480 researchers in 50 countries gathered data up to 2010 from surveys, censuses and past studies. They used statistical modeling to fill in the gaps for countries with little information. The series was mainly paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

As in 1990, Japan topped the life expectancy list in 2010, with 79 for men and 86 for women. In the U.S. that year, life expectancy for men was 76 and for women, 81.

The research found wide variations in what's killing people around the world. Some of the most striking findings highlighted by the researchers: — Homicide is the No. 3 killer of men in Latin America; it ranks 20th worldwide. In the U.S., it is the 21st cause of death in men, and in Western Europe, 57th.

— While suicide ranks globally as the 21st leading killer, it is as high as the ninth top cause of death in women across Asia's ""suicide belt,"" from India to China. Suicide ranks 14th in North America and 15th in Western Europe.

— In people aged 15-49, diabetes is a bigger killer in Africa than in Western Europe (8.8 deaths versus 1 death per 100,000).

— Central and Southeast Asia have the highest rates of fatal stroke in young adults at about 15 cases per 100,000 deaths. In North America, the rate is about 3 per 100,000.

Globally, heart disease and stroke remain the top killers. Reflecting an older population, lung cancer moved to the 5th cause of death globally, while other cancers including those of the liver, stomach and colon are also in the top 20. AIDS jumped from the 35th cause of death in 1990 to the sixth leading cause two decades later.

While chronic diseases are killing more people nearly everywhere, the overall trend is the opposite in Africa, where illnesses like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are still major threats. And experts warn again shifting too much of the focus away from those ailments.

""It's the nature of infectious disease epidemics that if you turn away from them, they will crop right back up,"" said Jennifer Cohn, a medical coordinator at Doctors Without Borders.

Still, she acknowledged the need to address the surge of other health problems across Africa. Cohn said the agency was considering ways to treat things like heart disease and diabetes. ""The way we treat HIV could be a good model for chronic care,"" she said.

Others said more concrete information is needed before making any big changes to public health policies.

""We have to take this data with some grains of salt,"" said Sandy Cairncross, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

He said the information in some of the Lancet research was too thin and didn't fully consider all the relevant health risk factors.

""We're getting a better picture, but it's still incomplete,"" he said.",13/12/2012
NewsDay,Editorial: Don't let up on AIDS fight now,"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has outlined a blueprint for creating an AIDS-free generation. Reaching that goal, which she announced last week, will take time, patience and money, but the very discussion of it is a milestone: It is now possible to talk about a world in which AIDS -- after killing 30 million people in 30 years -- begins a slow fade.

How did we reach this point?

The answer is instructive: It wasn't with the breaththough discovery of a vaccine or a cure -- even though some of the best minds in medical research continue to work on those. Rather, the long fight against AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has progressed in a plodding ground game that has racked up steady, incremental gains.

The progress is undeniable: The number of new HIV infections has dropped 19 percent over the past 10 years worldwide, and AIDS-related deaths have dropped 26 percent since 2005.

Among the most recent advances:

A dramatically expanded use of life-saving antiretroviral drugs. In 2003, just 50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa who needed the drugs got them. Today, more than 5 million people in Africa, along with more than 1 million in other parts of the world, are being treated with antiretrovirals.

The use of antiretroviral regimens to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in utero. Between 2009 and 2011, the world saw a 24 percent drop in new HIV infections each year among children, from 430,000 cases to 330,000.

The crucial discovery in 2011 that antiretrovirals not only keep people with HIV alive but also reduce spread of the virus from someone who is infected to someone who is not.

What does Clinton mean by an AIDS-free generation?

She is talking about a world where virtually no children are born with HIV, and where kids can grow up and live as adults without a high risk of infection.

Another key point: Financed by initiatives such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, this health-care effort has a broader aim than AIDS alone. It has created a global health-care supply line for immunizations and medicines to fight a multiplicity of lethal diseases.

This helps explain why agencies like UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, can now report dramatic drops in child mortality rates, not just for AIDS, but across the board.

The number of deaths among children younger than 5 has dropped more than 40 percent since 1990, UNICEF says.

The Clinton blueprint for an AIDS-free generation emphasizes a combination strategy that includes ending mother-to-child HIV transmission, expanding voluntary male circumcision and scaling up treatment for those living with HIV/AIDS.

But stepped-up programs will require stepped-up funding.

Even though the global economy remains troubled, this is no time for donor nations to pull back. The world has seen tremendous progress against AIDS and other diseases. It only makes sense to seize the moment and keep the momentum going.",05/12/2012
NewsDay,Clinton releases road map for AIDS-free generation,"WASHINGTON -- In an ambitious road map for slashing the global spread of AIDS, the Obama administration says treating people sooner and more rapid expansion of proven tools could help even the hardest-hit countries begin turning the tide of the epidemic in the next three to five years.

""An AIDS-free generation is not just a rallying cry -- it is a goal that is within our reach,"" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who ordered the blueprint, said. "". . . HIV may well be with us into the future but the disease that it causes need not be,"" she said Thursday at the State Department.

President Barack Obama echoed that promise. ""We stand at a tipping point in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and working together, we can realize our historic opportunity to bring that fight to an end,"" Obama said in a proclamation for World AIDS Day .

Some 34 million people worldwide are living with HIV, and despite a decline in new infections in the last decade, 2.5 million people were infected last year. Given those staggering figures, what does an AIDS-free generation mean? That virtually no babies are born infected, that young people have a lower risk than today of becoming infected, and that people who already have HIV would receive lifesaving treatment.

That last step is key: Treating people early in their infection, before they get sick, not only helps them survive but also dramatically cuts the chances of infecting others.

Yesterday's report from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief outlines how progress could continue at current spending levels, something far from certain as Congress and Obama struggle to avert looming budget cuts at year's end, or how faster progress is possible with stepped-up commitments from hard-hit countries themselves.",29/11/2012
NewsDay,CDC: HIV spread high in young males,"Health officials say 1 in 5 new HIV infections occur in a tiny segment of the population -- young men who are gay or bisexual.

The government released new numbers Tuesday that spotlight how the spread of the AIDS virus is heavily concentrated in young males who have sex with other males. Only about a quarter of new infections in the 13-to-24 age group are from injecting drugs or heterosexual sex.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said blacks represented more than half of new infections in youths. The estimates are based on 2010 figures.

Overall, new U.S. HIV infections have held steady at around 50,000 a year. About 12,000 are in teens and young adults, and most youth with HIV haven't been tested.

More than half of young people infected with HIV are not aware of it, according to the report. And those ages 13 to 24 account for 26 percent of all new HIV infections.

""Given everything we know about HIV and how to prevent it in 30 years of fighting the disease, it's just unacceptable that young people are becoming infected at such high rates,"" CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters.

NewsDay,Matthew McConaughey talks shocking weight loss,"Matthew McConaughey's stunning weight loss for his upcoming role as an HIV-positive man has caused quite the stir, and now, the actor is opening up about his shockingly skinny frame.

Weighing only 143 pounds, the formerly chiseled 6-foot tall actor insists he feels ""fine"" in a new interview with The Daily Beast.

""I got the means to lose the weight in a really healthy way - I'm eating fresh fish. I'm just eating small amounts. I'm not being starved,"" McConaughey said. ""I'm sleeping well. I've got clean meals that I'm cooking for myself.""

The actor and father of two said prepping for his role in ""The Dallas Buyer's Club"" is ""an exercise in discipline.""

""If anything, it's as much a spiritual journey as it is physical,"" he said. ""My body is fine. I'm taking care of myself. Everything has shrunk quite a bit. It's really been enlightening to understand my anatomy. I don't have the leverage I used to. I have body soreness.""",27/11/2012
NewsDay,Push to make HIV tests more common,"WASHINGTON -- There's a new push to make testing for the AIDS virus as common as cholesterol checks.

Americans from ages 15 to 64 should get an HIV test at least once -- not just people considered at high risk for the virus, an independent panel that sets screening guidelines proposed yesterday.

The draft guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are the latest recommendations that aim to make HIV screening a routine part of a checkup. Since 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has pushed for widespread, routine HIV screening.

Still, of the more than 1.1 million Americans living with HIV, nearly 1 in 5 -- almost 240,000 people -- don't know it. Not only is their own health at risk without treatment, they could unwittingly be spreading the virus to others.

The updated guidelines will bring this long-simmering issue before doctors and their patients again -- emphasizing that public health experts agree on how important it is to test even people who don't think they're at risk, because they could be.

""It allows you to say, 'This is a recommended test that we believe everybody should have. We're not singling you out in any way,' "" said task force member Dr. Douglas Owens, of Stanford University and the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System.

And if finalized, the task force guidelines could extend the number of people eligible for an HIV screening without a co-pay in their doctor's office, as part of free preventive care under the Obama administration's health care law. Under the task force's previous guidelines, only people at increased risk for HIV -- which includes gay and bisexual men and injecting drug users -- were eligible for that no-copay screening.",19/11/2012
NewsDay,Top Docs: 5 facts about infectious disease,"This time of year, any mention of infectious disease usually brings to mind the flu. But plenty of other germs are worth worrying about, too.

Here's what you need to know about five infectious diseases:

1. FLU IS NOT TO BE SNEEZED AT

Flu is nothing to take lightly. It can lead to serious complications and death. But it's difficult to diagnose because it can appear to be a common cold.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

""The classic symptoms are fever, chills, sore throat, headache and muscle aches and pains,"" said Dr. Bernard Nash, an infectious disease specialist in West Islip and a professor of medicine at the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine. ""In the typical case of influenza, the illness lasts several days, and the vast majority of people recover. However, as was seen with the new H1N1 strain that appeared in 2009 and the possibility of a new strain developing every year, it can cause severe illness and death.""

Seek medical assistance if you have a high fever (101 degrees or greater), shaking, chills and aches and pains along with the fever, and a decline in appetite or ability to drink, said Dr. Joseph Cervia, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Comprehensive HIV Care and Research Center at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park.

To prevent flu, physicians recommend people in a long list of risk groups -- which includes those older than 65, pregnant women, people with asthma and those with diabetes -- get a flu vaccine, Nash said. But anyone who wants to keep from getting the flu should consider one too, he said. Be aware, however, that the vaccine takes 10 to 14 days to take effect, said Dr. Bruce E. Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital, ""so one can still get the flu right after the vaccine.""

2. MRSA CAN LOOK LIKE A SPIDER BITE

Better known as MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a potentially deadly kind of staph infection that used to be found mainly in hospitals. Now, however, people in the wider community often become infected with it. It's caused by bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics.

""The typical presentation is an abscess that looks like a spider bite,"" Nash said. ""The likelihood of a spider bite on Long Island is very low. In fact, if someone says they were bitten by a spider, it is more likely that they have a MRSA infection.""

If you develop a suspicious abscess, ""it is important to seek medical care and get on appropriate antibiotics -- usually a sulfa drug or tetracycline -- and avoid squeezing the abscess,"" he said. The most danger comes if the bacteria spread from the skin into the bloodstream, lungs, heart, bones or joints, as this can lead to life-threatening infections.

Be aware that it's a skin infection that can spread through families, sports teams and children through poor hygiene, Nash said. ""A good antiseptic soap and adherence to good hygiene is the best prevention.""

3. SHINGLES VACCINE RECOMMENDED IF YOU'RE OVER 60

If you're older than 50 and had chickenpox as a kid, shingles should be on your radar. The dormant virus can make a return appearance, causing skin rashes and plenty of pain.

""It's an extremely painful and debilitating condition, and it can become a source of chronic pain,"" Cervia said. He recommends that people 60 and older get a vaccination that prevents shingles.

Nash also recommends the vaccine. ""It has been shown to reduce the likelihood of getting shingles by 50 percent and the severe pain after by two-thirds,"" he said. ""It is a very beneficial vaccine that can prevent much suffering.""

4. PERTUSSIS IS NOT JUST FOR KIDS

Whooping cough -- also known as pertussis or the ""100-days cough"" -- is no longer a disease only of the very young. It now affects adults, too, Nash said. No one is sure quite why.

""It classically presents as a typical cold, but over a week, severe coughing spells develop with the characteristic whoop heard as you breathe in all the air that was expelled from your lung from the severe coughing,"" he said. ""It can cause severe fatigue due to coughing and is highly contagious.""

Newborns and unvaccinated people suffer the most harmful effects from the disease, which can be fatal, Nash noted. ""The number of cases on Long Island has increased over the last several years and has caused local outbreaks,"" he said. ""It is now highly recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all susceptible people get vaccinated.""

To Nash, that means all adults. ""Because most of us have lost our immunity to pertussis, it is important that everyone get a one-time booster of the adult formulation of the Tdap vaccine,"" he explained. ""This is a dead vaccine that not only protects us against tetanus and diphtheria but also pertussis."" The CDC urges that all adults, even those who were vaccinated in childhood or have had pertussis, get a Tdap booster, no matter when they got their last tetanus shot.

It's especially important for grandparents to get vaccinated, Nash added, because they often care for newborns when parents work.

5. C. DIFFICILE COLITIS 'ALMOST EPIDEMIC'

Clostridium difficile colitis, or C. difficile, which causes diarrhea and can lead to life-threatening complications, is becoming more common and ""is almost at epidemic proportions,"" Nash said. The reason, he said, is overuse of antibiotics, which has allowed bacteria to develop resistance.

The condition can be tough to treat and recurs about 25 percent of the time. ""I have taken care of many patients who have had multiple recurrences and require treatment with medication that can last for months to several years,"" he said.

For prevention's sake, don't push doctors to prescribe antibiotics, Nash said. ""Most of the time, a good exam to rule out a bacterial infection and reassurance is all that is needed.""

How they were picked

Castle Connolly Medical Ltd. is a health-care research and information company founded in 1991 by a former medical college board chairman and president to help guide consumers to America's top doctors and top hospitals. Castle Connolly's established survey and research process, under the direction of a doctor, involves tens of thousands of top doctors and the medical leadership of leading hospitals.

Castle Connolly's physician-led team of researchers follows a rigorous screening process to select top doctors on both the national and regional levels. Its online nominations process -- located at castleconnolly.com/ nominations -- is open to all licensed physicians in America who are able to nominate physicians in any medical specialty and in any part of the country, as well as indicate whether the nominated physician is, in their opinion, among the best in their region in their medical specialty or among the best in the nation in their medical specialty.

Careful screening of doctors' educational and professional experience is essential before final selection is made among those physicians most highly regarded by their peers. The result -- Castle Connolly identifies the top doctors in America and provides the consumer with detailed information about their education, training and special expertise in their paperback guides, national and regional magazine ""Top Doctors"" features and online directories. Doctors do not and cannot pay to be selected and profiled as Castle Connolly Top Doctors. (Newsday is not part of the selection process.)

NewsDay,'Star Wars: The Old Republic' now free-to-play,"There is no longer a subscription fee needed to alter time, speed up the harvest and teleport yourself into a galaxy far, far away.

'Star Wars: The Old Republic' is now free-to-play (F2P) and allows for anyone with a PC to join hundreds of thousands of MMORPG gamers in their quest for dominance between the Sith Empire and the Republic. I've reached the endgame of just three of the eight iconic Star Wars classes and thoroughly enjoyed the elaborate story lines despite having to tread through some repeated side quests along the way. Subscribers from launch day like myself are not being forgotten either. Promotional in-game currency called Cartel Coins can be used in-game to purchase items and additional game features in the newly created Cartel Market.

A subscription can still be purchased as it allows players to continue accessing all of the game they've been enjoying for nearly a year. Flashpoints and War Zones have limitations for those who want the free-to-play experience that primarily focuses on players who want just the chance to see how each classes story pans out. After hitting the level 50 cap, a subscription of at least a month to the game is worth it just to try out some of the Operations that push groups of players to their limits. And the loot will be worth it.

If you love Star Wars, BioWare hit a home run with the expanded universe plots and characters so do yourself a favor and download the game today. On the in-game Planet of Belsavis, a mission has even been made public that could land you your very own Assassin Droid (HK-51).

NewsDay,'La Rafle' review: A Holocaust story,"In the French import ""La Rafle (The Round Up),"" writer-director Rose Bosch imbues her characters with dignity, humanity and hope, so much so that she seems to have lost sight of the fact that she's making a Holocaust film. In 1942, France sold out its Jews to appease Hitler, rounding up 13,000 and holding them in the Vel' d'Hiv sports hall in Paris before they were sent to the camps. Dignity, humanity and hope had very little to do with any of it. But nearly 70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, filmmakers (see: ""Schindler's List,"" ""Life Is Beautiful,"" even ""Inglourious Basterds"") seem to want to make the Final Solution into something other than what it was, and give it qualities it didn't have.

What it didn't have is the cosmetic gloss Bosch applies, casting her well-made and certainly heart-tugging movie with beautiful, and beautifully defiant, French people who somehow thought they could ride out the terrors of Nazism, and wait for the war to end. In this, ""La Rafle"" is on to something universal, namely denial.

But had the sunny landscapes and inspiring characters degenerated into something truly horrible, the effect might have been nightmarish and thus appropriate. There is brutality in ""La Rafle,"" certainly, and a sense of horror, but the utter hopelessness experienced by European Jewry is never hinted at, and in its way this betrays the Holocaust story.

It is unfortunate because if not for its fact-based handicap, the film is well-made and affecting. Melanie Laurent (""Beginners"") gives an inspiring performance as a gentile nurse who goes along to treat the prisoners and their children on their journey to the death camps; Jean Reno, monument of French cinema, is just right as the overwhelmed Jewish doctor trying to single-handedly treat 13,000 doomed patients. The hero is plucky, real-life Jo Weissman (Hugo Leverdez), who makes a break for it after losing his mother (the beautiful Raphaëlle Agogué), lives to a ripe old age and helps make the viewer forget what really happened.

NewsDay,Seniors fix computers for needy families,"Rich Romaneck, who has been a software engineer, licensed practical nurse and an anesthesia technician, thrives on reinvention.

So his latest transition — joining a program devoted to rebuilding used computers for Long Islanders who can't afford them — came as naturally to him as breathing.

Romaneck, 69, of Lake Ronkonkoma found his new calling while reading a newsletter for retirees of Northrop Grumman Corp., where he had worked for 31 years. An article described the Community Computer Connections Program (CCCP), one of several services offered by the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, most often referred to as RSVP, which enlists the help of retirees who use their diverse skills to help others in various areas. The program's description piqued Romaneck's interest. ""I was looking for something like that,"" he said, ""challenging and rewarding.""

He contacted CCCP's founder and coordinator, Joel Becker, a retired antenna engineer from Hauppauge who worked with Long Island companies involved in defense electronics before opening his own business in 1979 as a consultant designing antennae.

CCCP has about 45 mostly retired volunteers who refurbish used computers donated by libraries, corporations, Suffolk County, Brookhaven Town and individuals (see box). The reconditioned computers are provided free to those in need. Since 2006, the computers have been installed in nearly 2,400 homes, said Becker, who is 78.

""I gradually started retiring around 2000,"" he said. Two years later, he helped launch an adopt-a-family program that paired volunteers with low-income families needing food, clothing and other support. Among the items provided were used computers, refurbished for children. ""I realized that families with kids needed so much help that the last thing they could afford to buy for their kids was a computer,"" Becker explained. ""As the Internet was becoming a very valuable resource, these kids would need computers to keep up and get ahead in school.""

Seniors, single-parent families, people living in group homes, victims of domestic violence, those who have lost their jobs, people with disabilities and agencies that assist people with HIV/AIDS are among CCCP's clients. ""The need is great and increasing, especially nowadays,"" Becker said.

When the computer aspect of that program lost its sponsor in 2006, Becker teamed up with the federally funded RSVP organization in Smithtown to create the CCCP. The all-volunteer CCCP became a Microsoft Registered Refurbisher, authorized as a nonprofit to purchase the Microsoft Windows Operating System for $6 a computer. RSVP seeks grants to cover the cost for Windows, hard drives and support equipment for each computer, including a mouse.

Best Bets Get the scoop on events, nightlife, day trips, family fun and things to do on Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

All at no cost

After removing data from the donated hard drives and repairing any problems, the refurbishers install Windows XP or Windows 7, free educational and other software, and an anti-virus program, all at no cost to the new owners. Clients get a number to call if problems develop, but they must pay for their own Internet service.

In addition to the refurbishers — many of whom are retired engineers from across the Island who do the work at home — the program provides transporters who pick up donated computers and deliver them to the refurbishers. Other volunteers install the computers in clients' homes and give a brief lesson on how to use them.

The volunteers, Becker said, ""are mostly people who have worked all their lives, who are retired and find themselves with time on their hands and say, 'What do I want to spend the rest of my life doing? Give back to the community.' "" There also are some who are still working but who volunteer on weekends, he said.

Romaneck devotes 15 to 20 hours a week to refurbishing. ""I have quite a bit of hands-on with hardware and software,"" he said. Since volunteering for CCCP in 2008, he has renewed about 400 computers. ""When you read what people are going through and understand how you can change their life, it's extremely satisfying,"" he said. ""Most of us can afford a computer and take it for granted, but if you don't have one, you're at a big disadvantage.""

Peter Harrington, 77, a former Grumman software engineer, has been with CCCP since 2006. He repairs computers from one to seven hours a day and estimates he has refurbished hundreds of them at his Oyster Bay home. ""I was retired and was looking for something to keep me busy,"" Harrington said. ""It sounded like a good fit for me. I have my experience and my knowledge and I get a lot of satisfaction out of being able to help a lot of people. These days you have to know how to use a computer in order to participate in the economic life of the country. And now people can contact their friends and relatives through email, do job searches, and students can use it for course work.""

For Lisa Simpson, a single mother of two from Wyandanch, CCCP was the answer to a prayer.

""It's an excellent program,"" she said. A virus wrecked her family computer and she needed a replacement, especially for her daughter, Shanel Young, 14, and her son, Tilik Young, 10. ""My daughter likes to write short stories,"" Simpson said. ""She didn't have a computer to put her thoughts down. My son likes to play the games.""

Simpson works nights as a U.S. Postal Service mail handler, so she couldn't escort her children to the library to use the computers there, and she couldn't afford a new one.

""I was praying,"" she said. ""I didn't know where to get the money from.""

'It was a blessing'

A friend told her about CCCP and she called. ""They said they had a computer for me. It was a blessing. The computer came with an anti-virus protection program, games for my son, and they put a notebook on there for my daughter,"" Simpson said. ""My daughter is writing. She took some of her work to school, and her teacher was amazed.""

Another client, Gritley Morris, 77, of Westbury, wanted a computer to communicate with her adult children on the island of Jamaica. CCCP brought one quickly, but she can't afford to have an Internet hookup, so her usage is limited. ""I can turn it on and get games,"" she said.

One of Becker's primary roles is raising donations for CCCP's operating funds. ""I beat the bushes, so to speak,"" he said, ""getting grants"" from companies such as Computer Associates and Capital One Bank.

""I always felt there was a lot of injustice in the world, and I try to do something where I can get a feeling of satisfaction in my own small way,"" Becker said. ""Our biggest need now is for volunteers who are technically oriented — installers — and people with transportation.""

Pegi Orsino, Suffolk RSVP executive director, said other volunteers also call homebound seniors, run errands for them and visit senior centers to talk about managing chronic health conditions.

""Seniors have so much to give,"" she said. ""Joel Becker came to us with this fabulous idea. There are so many financially challenged families. We take it for granted that everybody has a computer, but that's not true.""

How you can help

The Community Computer Connections Program accepts donated computers that are 5 years old or newer.

Volunteers needed:

— Those who are technically oriented to refurbish and install computers

— Drivers with vehicles to pick up bulk donations of computers from corporations and libraries and transport them to the refurbishers; after they're reconditioned, deliver them to the social services agencies that distribute them

— A program coordinator to replace Joel Becker, who will concentrate on fundraising and obtaining equipment next year; should be able to work 10 hours a week, direct managers and conduct meetings. Experience is not required but would be helpful. Call 631-979-9490 or go to bit.ly/TEBrSI.",25/10/2012
NewsDay,Letter: Narcan kits are life-savers,"The letter writer is off base when he suggests that the distribution of Narcan kits to reverse potentially fatal drug overdoses might actually increase substance abuse [""Narcan kits are two-edged sword,"" Oct. 11]. That's the same mindset that allowed HIV/AIDS to kill Americans as we bickered about whether a piece of latex would encourage people to become promiscuous.

Think about it. We don't all drive faster because our cars are equipped with airbags, nor do we eat more cheeseburgers because there's an automated external defibrillator bolted to the wall in our corporate cafeteria.

Addiction is an inherently irrational brain disease; potentially avoiding death doesn't encourage drug use any more than the fear of death stops it. Addiction, however, is also treatable and needn't prove fatal.

Too many Long Island families are losing the race against time as they beg, plead and try to cajole a loved one into treatment for a disease whose calling-card is massive denial. Too many young people never make it through the doors of a treatment center, never come face to face with a counselor and never get a shot at experiencing the miracle of recovery.

Narcan kits save lives, create new opportunities for recovery and enable families to arrange treatment instead of a funeral.

NewsDay,Salt-N-Pepa enter Long Island Music Hall of Fame,"Salt-N-Pepa have gotten used to fans telling them how their music has shaped people's lives.

""We hear that constantly,"" says Cheryl ""Salt"" James-Wray, the Brooklyn native who has lived in Melville for the past two decades. ""It's very flattering. We've even made it part of our show. When we're on stage, we ask how many people did 'Whatta Man' or 'Shoop' in their high school talent show, and so many people raise their hands. They identify with us -- the regular, fun girls having a good time.""

What Salt-N-Pepa haven't gotten used to, though, is music industry acknowledgment of their successes -- all five of their albums have gone at least gold, including ""Very Necessary,"" which is certified platinum five times, three No. 1 rap singles, three MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy for best rap group performance in 1994. That's why members of the group, which also includes DJ Spinderella, say their induction into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame Oct. 18 at the Paramount in Huntington is so important to them, especially as they continue to work on rebuilding the group together.

""It's an all-around great feeling,"" says Sandra ""Pepa"" Denton, the Jamaica native who now lives in New Jersey. ""It's great to be told that we're still relevant. We've been in the game for so long, it's great to be honored for our contributions to the game of hip-hop and be told that we're not forgotten about, that our music is timeless.""

Their music holds up

Like so many acts from the early days of hip-hop, Salt-N-Pepa are particularly proud of their music's standing the test of time, since so many criticized hip-hop as a fad when they were starting out. Of course, ""Push It"" and ""Shoop"" are still hip-hop radio classics, while ""Whatta Man"" was just covered in its entirety by Ellen DeGeneres and ""Pitch Perfect"" star Rebel Wilson on DeGeneres' talk show earlier this month.

For Salt, though, it was the first single from their 1990 album, ""Blacks' Magic,"" that stands out as a turning point in the group's career.

""'Expression' is a song that I wrote and produced and it was a platinum single,"" she says. ""I remember that making me feel really good as an artist because it meant I could put a record together that would be a platinum single and as a female, because most guys are producers.""

It also signaled a change in how the group approached music and how Salt-N-Pepa wanted to use their success for something more than party-starting. ""You don't want to make a song sound preachy and corny,"" she says. ""It's a challenge to say something significant and make the record still enjoyable. It became more important to me to not just make you 'shake your thang,' but make you think and affect your life in a positive way through music and lyrics.""

Pepa points to their hit ""Let's Talk About Sex,"" also from ""Blacks' Magic,"" as another significant moment for the group. ""We wanted to find a balance,"" she says. ""I'm not a role model and things get tricky with that, but we did feel a sense of responsibility. It was a dream come true being the only females out there really making noise. We were very boisterous and we said what we wanted.""

They were brutally honest

Salt-N-Pepa were able to open a discussion about sex that was honest, but not judgmental, while still keeping the song danceable. (It became a Top 10 dance hit, as well as a Top 20 pop hit.) They then expanded the song by changing it to ""Let's Talk About AIDS,"" which outlined the importance of safe sex. ""We were trying to address a serious problem,"" says Pepa, who worked with Lifebeat, headlining numerous fundraisers for the HIV/AIDS awareness-raising group, including the first Urban Aid at Madison Square Garden in 1995. ""I'm still involved with that.""

It's no surprise that the group's interest in open discussions even extends to its own breakup in 2002 and reunion in 2007.

""All that glitters is not gold,"" Salt says. ""I know we may have seemed to be on top of the world ... but it takes a toll on you. In this business, you're constantly in demand and nobody really cares about you. You're just a product.""

Salt says the stresses lead many musicians to struggle with drugs or low self-esteem. ""I was bulimic and after years of trying to control it, I had to stop for my health, my physical health and mental health,"" she says. ""I gave up something to gain something. I gave up to have a real life.""

Her life became centered on her family, raising her son and daughter in Melville. (She laughs off any criticism about moving to Long Island's hurting her hip-hop credibility, saying, ""I'm not trying to stay 'street.' I'm trying to be a good wife and raise my children well. We're adults."")

""When I got my sea legs back and I was strong enough to deal, I came back,"" she says. ""I took baby steps. But I did what I wanted to do instead of feeling I had to do everything for everybody. I don't regret it. A lot of people don't understand, and I was surprised. Fans were mad, they thought I was selfish. I was thinking it was an honorable thing to do and thought people would commend me and it was the opposite reaction, even though I thought I was doing something good. It was like, 'You belong to us! You stay out there! You make music and you do concerts! You give us what we want!' It's all good. I love my fans and I love that they love me like that, that they feel we've affected their lives in a positive way.""

NewsDay,Kids with food allergies face the school yard bully,"Children with food allergies who are exposed to potentially life-threatening situations because of their medical condition also face another threat — the school yard bully.

A 2010 study — the most recent data available on food allergies and bullying — published by the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, reported that more than 30 percent of children have been bullied, teased or harassed because of their food allergy. Eighty-two percent of food bullying occurred at school and 80 percent of the incidents were perpetrated by classmates.

A food allergy is ""an overreaction of the immune system in response to a food protein,"" says Veronica Brown, spokeswoman for the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network, and can be fatal. In the United States, 5.9 million children (1 in 13 kids) are said to have a food allergy. Reactions range from rashes and hives to trouble breathing or loss of consciousness.

“In children with food allergies, bullying could be in the form of teasing someone because of their food allergy, or even threatening the victim with an allergen,” such as “intentionally spilling milk on a child who is allergic to it,” Brown says. “Kids with food allergies already are dealing with stress caused by fear or anxiety about accidental exposure to a food allergen. When these children are targeted because of their food allergy, these fears can be exacerbated” and they “can experience depression and low self-esteem.”

Parents can look out for warning signs such as changes in child’s behavior or a desire to avoid school. Schools also can implement anti-bullying programs, Brown says.

NewsDay,Court allows medical pot vote in Arkansas,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld yesterday a proposed ballot measure that, if successful, would make the state the first in the South to legalize medical marijuana.

Justices rejected a challenge by a coalition of conservative groups who had asked the court to block the proposed initiated act from the November ballot or order the state to not count any votes cast on the issue.

The measure would allow patients with qualifying conditions to buy marijuana from nonprofit dispensaries with a doctor's recommendation. The proposal acknowledges that marijuana is still illegal under federal law. The Coalition to Preserve Arkansas Values argued that it doesn't adequately explain that approved users could still face federal prosecution.

Arkansas will be the first Southern state to put the medical marijuana question to voters. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have legalized it in some fashion. Massachusetts voters are also expected to vote on the issue this fall, while the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled a medical marijuana initiative can't appear on that state's ballot.

The group behind the measure, Arkansans for Compassionate Care, told the court it believes the measure is sufficiently fair to go before voters.

""Now that we've passed muster with the Supreme Court we'll begin our campaign to show the people of the state of Arkansas that this is truly a compassionate measure,"" Couch said.

Under the proposal, qualifying health conditions would include cancer, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease. The proposal also would allow qualifying patients or a designated caregiver to grow marijuana if the patient lives more than 5 miles from a dispensary.",27/09/2012

NewsDay,HIV treatment creator Jerome Horwitz,"When medical researcher Jerome P. Horwitz first synthesized the chemical compound AZT in the 1960s, he hoped it would be a successful treatment for cancer. At first, he thought he had failed.

And in the short term, he had. AZT was not a cure for cancer. But two decades later, it emerged as a treatment for a disease that had not yet been named when Horwitz was toiling in his Detroit laboratory. The disease was HIV/AIDS. In 1987, AZT became the first treatment for the virus approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

AZT was not a cure, and it had downsides, including sky-high costs and dangerous side effects. But it was the first treatment that significantly decreased HIV-related mortality rates -- at a time when many scientists considered HIV an untreatable disease. It later became part of a drug combination that curbed deaths even further.

Even as those ""cocktails"" were supplanted by other more effective regimens, scientists say, AZT has continued to serve as a model for treatment of the disease.

""AZT stood up and said, 'Stop your pessimism,' "" said Samuel Broder, a National Cancer Institute scientist who headed a group of scientists that helped discover the therapeutic nature of AZT in the 1980s. "" 'Stop your sense of futility. Go back to the lab. Go back to development. Go back to clinical trials. Things will work.' ""

Horwitz died Sept. 6 at 93 at a hospital in West Bloomfield Township, Mich. His death, from pneumonia and a heart attack, was confirmed by his wife, Sharon Newman Horwitz. He had worked for nearly five decades at Wayne State University in Detroit and the affiliated institution now known as the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute.

Jerome Phillip Horwitz was born Jan. 16, 1919, in Detroit. Horwitz decided to pursue science after reading Paul de Kruif's book ""Microbe Hunters"" as a teenager.

He received a bachelor's degree in 1942 and a master's degree in 1944, both in chemistry and from the University of Detroit Mercy, and a doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of Michigan in 1948. In 1956, he joined Wayne State University.

NewsDay,'Social entrepreneurs' build LI business,"When most entrepreneurs start businesses, one of their primary goals is to make as much money as they can. Brian McHale and Morgan Fuchs want to make money, but they plan to give it all away.

The two surfing buddies started their company, Hive Lip Balm, in 2008 as a hobby and a way to give back to the community. Like Paul Newman's ""Newman's Own"" brand, the company plans to donate all of its profits to charity.

Their product is sold in 500 stores in 23 states, and Fuchs said they have given almost $16,000 to environmental charities such as the Nature Conservancy and the Ocean Conservancy during their four years of operation.

""You get a little desensitized working in the corporate world, and that was part of the reason why we wanted to start the business,"" said Fuchs, 37, of Medford, who previously did public relations at a tech company. ""Business has a tremendous ability to generate revenue and we wondered if we could do the same model Newman did but do it in a different industry.""

""Social entrepreneurship"" is a growing trend, said Jim Freeley, a professor of management at Long Island University who teaches a class on how to start businesses that will benefit society.

A plan for successful giving

He cautioned that social entrepreneurs must be careful when creating their business models.

Giving profits to charity can help in the marketing of products, Freeley said, but it can be an impractical business model. Entrepreneurs need to have a viable business plan, independent of their altruistic mission.

McHale and Fuchs said marketing their lip balm on the ""all profits to charity"" feature initially helps, but they've learned that it won't generate repeat customers.

""The fact that we donate 100 percent of profits to charity, it gets our foot in the door, but what has people returning is the quality of the product,"" Fuchs said. ""If you have a good message but a bad product, people don't come back for that.""

McHale and Fuchs hit upon lip balm after first selling an organic surf wax. Surf store owners suggested they try lip balm instead to expand their market. The company's first account for Hive was with Hampton Coffee Company on the East End, and they expanded to beach stores and resort towns from there.

Fuchs is the company's only employee, and he has been on the payroll for only a year. McHale, 34, also of Medford, is still working a full-time job as an engineer and volunteers his time to the company. The two, who used their own money to start the business, said they are happy to nurture the enterprise as it grows slowly.

To create their lip balm, they experimented in Fuchs' backyard. They needed to hold costs down, but also wanted to use mostly organic ingredients, in keeping with their ""green"" mission.

""It took many hours sitting in front of a hot pot,"" McHale said. ""We made a lot more trips to Michael's [craft store] than two guys in their late 20s should have.""

They contract with a company in the Midwest to produce the lip balm, which comes in six flavors. It retails for about $3. Once the product was developed, ""the challenge is creating a brand out of nowhere,"" McHale said. ""We're doing things very grassroots. I'm actually impressed with what we've been able to do in four years.""

Looking ahead for charity

The company is expanding into the sunscreen market; they've started selling Hive Sunscreen in some locations.

While the pair say that getting accounts has not been difficult, they have had to consider travel costs. They started by visiting each store in person, but now try to keep overhead costs to a minimum, setting up accounts over the phone whenever possible. Most of the day-to-day operations are conducted over the phone from Fuchs' home.

""The first couple of years we definitely realized how quickly you can spend money, especially when it's coming out of your own pocket,"" Fuchs said.

NewsDay,Foley nursing home sale stalls in committee,"Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone's controversial plan to sell the John J. Foley nursing home failed to make it out of the legislature's health committee Thursday, forcing the administration to seek a special petition to get it before the full legislature next week.

The five-member committee includes two staunch opponents of the sale and one who must abstain on the matter because his wife works at the Yaphank facility. Bellone's office said getting the $23 million deal approved at next Thursday's meeting is critical to the 2013 budget, which must be submitted later this month and is expected to include savings from the Foley sale.

Bellone now must obtain a ""discharge petition"" with signatures from at least 10 of the 18 county lawmakers. Getting the discharge signatures, however, doesn't necessarily predict approval in the legislature.

Legis. Edward Romaine (R-Center Moriches) is the abstention, and Presiding Officer William Lindsay (D-Holbrook) is unsure if his health will allow him to attend the legislative meeting. That could mean that Bellone will need support from 10 of the 16 remaining lawmakers, leaving him a very small margin, as at least five of them are very likely to vote no.

Those lawmakers express concern about the negotiating process for the sale, the facility's ability to run more efficiently under county control and the for-profit buyer's commitment to caring for the sickest patients.

""We can debate this issue for the next three hours and would still come to the same conclusion,"" Legis. William Spencer (D-Centerport), the health committee chair and a sale supporter, said of the stalemate.

The private operators who have agreed to buy the 264-bed Yaphank nursing home have said they'll keep all current patients and offer jobs to all employees. By selling, the county could save between $17 million to $56 million over five years, according to widely varying estimates by legislative budget analysts and Bellone's fiscal experts.

Deputy County Executive Jon Schneider said the sale's failure, in the face of an estimated $250 million budget gap next year, could trigger consequences including a county credit rating downgrade.

""Given the county's fiscal crisis, the alternative would be closure of the facility and hundreds of additional layoffs,"" Schneider said in an email.

The resolution's tabling in committee Thursday came after public health advocates and the nursing home workers' union again spoke out strongly against the sale.

Gregory Noone, program manager for a charity supporting residents with HIV and AIDS, said Foley is one of the area's only facilities state designated to treat AIDS patients.

""The county will be a much less desirable place to live"" without a Suffolk-run Foley home, he said.

Also Thursday, the public safety committee approved a bill requiring Suffolk boaters to take boating safety classes that currently are offered by government agencies and nonprofits -- or risk being fined. The bill, sponsored by Legis. Steve Stern (D-Dix Hills) following the July 4 boating accident in Oyster Bay that killed three children, now goes before the full legislature.

NewsDay,Bill Clinton's nominating speech: View from the couch,"Howabout that nominating speech last night by Bill Clinton? Stirring, eloquent, forceful, thoughtful, passionate, conciliatory, humane, comprehensive and . . . long. Very long. Forty-eight minutes and change long. So long that about 11:15, ABC cut away to a delegate yawning very loudly. Cameras panned across glazed eyes. A quick glance up at Michelle Obama in the expensive house seats revealed someone whose mouth was set, unsmiling. The New York magazine headline this morning seemed to sum it up the marathon well: ""Bill Clinton Got a Few (Thousand) Things Off his Chest Tonight.""

The hivemind -- that rabble that shares obsessively on Twitter and Facebook -- started to turn against him at around 11. People started making jokes about missing flights, or waking up the next morning to see the speech still going, or perhaps wondering whether HE was running for something -- all stark contrast to minutes earlier when some seemed ready to appoint speech and speechgiver candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize.

So what happened? Let's go back to that couch in the living room from which speeches like this are best experienced and from which they are supposed to be experienced. An old rule in television says wrap it up by 11. It's not only an unwritten rule but codified in the very agreements between network and affiliate. Do not push your show past 11, unless it's a live sporting event or an awards show, or a few other exceptions. For just about 60 years, it's a rule that's bound viewers as well, who expect local news at that moment or head to bed. Their internal clock is set to that time too, 11 and done. When Clinton pushed past 11, he broke the rule -- broke it for everyone in Charlotte, and especially for everyone watching at home.

It was so long it muted -- if not quite bungled -- the made-for-TV moneyshot: President Obama walking out on stage to greet the former president.

Plus, it all brought back memories of '88 -- the Dukakis nominating speech that would not end -- weighing in at a relatively light 33 minutes -- and the line that got the biggest applause of the night from the governor of Arkansas: ""In conclusion...""

It was the most memorable TV moment of the entire 1988 convention. Clinton also bounced back, you may have heard -- a reason for that old nickname, ""The Comeback Kid."" In any event, let's take a walk down TV memory lane. Here are a couple of clips from back in the day. The second one features Harry Thomason, who handled Clinton's media strategy, speaking about how to engineer the media comeback after that fiasco.

NewsDay,NBA sponsors newest Net C.J. Watson on trip to Africa,"C.J. Watson is living out a dream, and doing it while fulfilling a self-imposed obligation to be a basketball ambassador.

Visiting Africa had been at the forefront of the mind of the new Nets reserve guard for years, and he wasn't sure exactly when the chance to visit the Motherland would arise. Turns out, after joining the NBA's ""Basketball Without Borders"" program more than a year ago, Watson is getting that opportunity at the moment -- much to his surprise.

""Actually, I got lucky,"" Watson told Newsday from Johannesburg, South Africa, ""because usually they don't let you come to Africa on your first trip [in the program]. So I was really lucky to be able to get here for the first time.""

The weeklong trip has taken Watson from Senegal to Johannesburg, all so the NBA can continue its grassroots effort to foster basketball growth on the large continent. Through outreach, the league also is trying to educate African youth about HIV/AIDS awareness and the importance of excelling in the classroom.

During the basketball clinics, the athletes work hard on fundamentals through a series of exercises and drills, Watson said. He runs a shooting station and helps to teach some of the basics, targeting footwork and the follow- through.

""It's fun,"" said Watson, who signed with the Nets last month after being waived by the Bulls. ""They already know a lot of stuff about basketball. It's just fun learning from an NBA player.

Venturing to Africa is just the latest in a series of important events for Watson. He recently finished his coursework at the University of Tennessee, earning his bachelor's degree in psychology.

It took a lot of discipline, he said, to juggle things and walk that balancing act between books and basketball even since his senior year in 2006.

No matter. He's done, finishing things up with some online courses during the last few summers.

""A lot of hard work and a lot of focus,"" he said, ""a lot of late nights trying to get tests done. It was a struggle. But I'm glad it's over with.""

Watson is so proud of his degree that he posted it on Twitter. Unfortunately, he said, his grandmother has passed away and won't be able to see it. A proud mother, though, can lay eyes on it as much as she chooses.

""My mom, she's very happy about it,"" Watson said. ""She used to ask me about it all the time. 'When are you going to go back to school? When are you going to get your degree?' So she doesn't have to ask me that anymore.""

Last month, Watson spent five days working out at the renowned rigorous camp of veteran NBA assistant coach Tim Grgurich in Watson's hometown of Las Vegas. He's done it every summer since his junior season but changed his approach this year during the two-a-day, training camp-style practices.

""I tried to go out there and go harder in the scrimmages and drills and learn a lot more from the coaches,"" Watson said. ""I tried to get my one-on-one moves better.""

Watson hopes those moves will translate into success in his first season in Brooklyn, a place that's essentially as new to him as Africa.

His excursion to the expansive continent is leaving a lasting impression, making him thankful for some of the simple things we get to enjoy in the United States.

""The two worlds are very different in every aspect,"" Watson said. ""I was telling one of my friends we have our 'hoods, but over here it's worse than the 'hood to me. But we are very blessed just to be an American, and to have the opportunities that we do have because a lot of kids don't get those same opportunities.""",01/09/2012
NewsDay,Ballroom dancers raise money for patients with chronic illnesses,"Marek Wasaznik twirled his dance partner Karolina Wysocka across the hardwood dance floor Friday night at the Polish Hall in Riverhead.

Dressed in a flowing orange dress, Wysocka flitted across the dance floor with ease, graceful and light.

When the pair finished their international waltz, the crowd burst into applause as the couple gracefully bowed.

No, it wasn’t a scene from “Dancing with the Stars.”

Living Well Yoga and Fitness hosted its inaugural Enchanted Evening Ballroom Show and Benefit Dance. The event raised money to fund free dance and exercise classes for those with chronic illnesses such as cancer, HIV and Parkinson’s disease.

“This is an opportunity for them [the patients] to come to this beautiful hall to dance,” said Lori Newell, 47, the owner of Living Well Yoga and Fitness in Montauk.

Ballroom dance lessons are an excellent way for patients of chronic illnesses to socialize and exercise in a fun and engaging manner, Newell said.

Living Well Yoga and Fitness, based in Montauk, works mainly with victims of chronic illnesses on the East End, such as patients at the Southampton Hospital’s David E. Rogers M.D. Center for HIV/AIDS Care.

“Ballroom dancing teaches us to have form,” said Susan Wojcik, 52, the assistant program coordinator at the David E. Rogers Center. “Balance is very important for people with chronic illnesses.”

The ballroom dancing event featured several performances from local dance instructors as well as a Chinese auction and 50/50 raffle.

“We’ve danced for many years and when you love it, you want to show it,” said Wasaznik, 50, the owner of the Ballroom Factory Dance Studio in Patchogue.

Marek and the other dance instructors who have danced for years showed off their prowess for the crowd of about 150, which ranged from senior citizens to young adults in their 20s.

“It’s great to perform,” added Wysocka, 24, also from the Ballroom Dance Studio. “Every performance is special.”

Many of the evening’s attendees were regular students of local ballroom dancing programs on Long Island. While some of the guests dance for health and medical reasons, others dance purely for the opportunity to meet new people and get out of the house on a Friday night.

NewsDay,Italian Cardinal Carlo Martini dies,"Italian Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, a liberal within the highly conservative Catholic Church hierarchy who was considered a papal contender in the last conclave, died Friday. He was 85.

Martini, a Jesuit and former archbishop of the important archdiocese of Milan, had been battling Parkinson's disease for several years.

He voiced openness to divisive issues for the church, such as using condoms to fight HIV/AIDS, priestly celibacy and homosexuality, which, showed his progressive bent.

He also was considered a possible contender in the 2005 conclave that brought the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, to the papacy.

Born on Feb. 15, 1927, in Turin, Martini was ordained a priest in the Society of Jesus in 1952. He was named archbishop of Milan in 1979 and held the post until his retirement in 2002; within that time, he was also head of the European Bishops' Conference for six years, until 1993.

A funeral was scheduled for Monday in Milan's cathedral.

NewsDay,Epidemiologist R. Palmer Beasley dies,"SEATTLE -- Adventurous, meticulous and intensely curious about the world and its people, Dr. R. Palmer Beasley, epidemiologist and infectious-disease expert, used those skills to discover the link between the hepatitis B virus and liver cancer -- proof that a virus could cause a human cancer, and a finding that ultimately led to vaccinations that saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Beasley, a former University of Washington faculty member and dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health, died Aug. 25 at his home in Houston from pancreatic cancer. He was 76.

Measles, plague, HIV -- they all intrigued Dr. Beasley, who had decided as a student at Harvard Medical School that he wanted to be an epidemiologist, studying infectious diseases. In the early 1970s, as a fellow in what became the UW School of Public Health, he jumped at the chance to go to Taiwan to research rubella (German measles). There, he became determined to delve into the mysteries of hepatitis B, which he considered the least understood unconquered virus of the time.

""He took an approach like Albert Schweitzer,"" said Dr. Herbert DuPont, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the University of Texas. ""He lived in the field, he worked with patients, with the people. He didn't go back to Seattle and sit in an office at the University of Washington and contact people in Taiwan.""

Dr. J. Thomas Grayston, then Beasley's supervisor at the UW, recalls a bit of friction in that regard. ""We talked to him about coming back, and he wasn't going to do that,"" said Grayston, the founding dean of the UW School of Public Health.

Beasley arranged independent funding for his research project, married a co-researcher and settled down in Taiwan, where he would spend the next 14 years. But he kept his affiliation with the UW, which lasted nearly two decades, and his affection for Seattle, ""the city where my heart is,"" he said in a 1999 UW video.

With exacting attention to detail, Beasley and his colleagues designed long-term studies that would follow more than 22,000 Taiwanese government workers for decades, in the process proving that the hepatitis B virus is a main cause of liver cancer -- at the time a controversial theory -- and that childbirth can transmit the virus from a mother to her baby, who becomes a carrier and much more likely to develop liver cancer.

Beasley found that a shot of immune globulin at birth protected babies; later, his work helped push the World Health Organization to include the hepatitis B vaccine in routine vaccination programs.

Now it’s honey harvest season, and on Tuesday museum visitors can try some of the bounty and engage in other bee-themed activities during the “Honey Hoopla.”

From 12:30 to 4 p.m., beekeeper Carl Flatow will demonstrate how honey is harvested from the hive. He’ll also have some samples he previously harvested available for tasting. “That’s the beauty of honey. It’s all natural; you can eat it right out of the comb,” Flatow says. “It’s healthy, good stuff.” The museum’s beehive was relocated to the museum from Lynbook, saved from a tree that was blown to pieces by Hurricane Irene.

Other activities during Honey Hoopla will include building big-eyed bee hats, creating bubble wands while learning what bubbles and bees have in common and insect-inspired face painting. All activities are drop in while supplies last, and are free with museum admission of $11 for adults and children older than 1. Seniors are $10; children younger than 1 are free.

NewsDay,3 million bees confiscated from NYC beekeeper Yi Gen Chen,"A swarm of some 3 million bees has been confiscated from a New York City beekeeper after his hobby got out of hand.

Andrew Cote of the city's Beekeepers Association tells the Daily News that beekeeper Yi Gen Chen ignored the rules of good urban beekeeping — and of common sense.

Cote and several beekeepers placed screens around each of Chen's hives Wednesday before removing them.

Chen told the News he started with one hive two years ago.

He said the bees got out of hand and he doesn't have the time or resources for them.

NewsDay,Camurati: STDs should remind teens that oral sex is still sex,"It may not get you pregnant, but it's still not risk-free.

More than two-thirds of today's kids have engaged in oral sex, and the research suggests that teens don’t know the health risks. They see it as a safer course of action than vaginal intercourse.

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control of nearly 10,000 men and women ages 15 to 24 revealed that while teenage sexual conduct has decreased and condom use has increased since the late '80s, the rate of sexually transmitted infections hasn't budged.

Unlike a typical interview, participants entered answers into a computer and did not have to disclose the intimate details of their personal lives to an unfamiliar adult. That significantly increases the chance that teens gave real information.

The percentages were fairly equal for boys and girls ages 15 to 19 across the board — 49 percent of boys admitted to giving or receiving oral sex, compared with 48 percent of girls. Similarly, 44 percent of boys have engaged in vaginal sex, while 47 percent of girls said they had.

About half of all the newly diagnosed STIs in 2010 were in that 15 to 24 age group. The increase in condom use is a great start, but if America's teenagers think oral sex can't do any harm, something needs to be done.

We harp on unwed pregnancies and underage parents most every day, but few touch the subject of any other potential risks. Some curriculums don't allow any lesson plan beyond abstinence-only, and those southern areas tend to have higher rates of teen pregnancy and STIs.

Mississippi constantly tops the list of teen pregnancies with a rate of 35.2 per 1,000 women, 15 points above the national average. The state is also in the middle of a sex education studies struggle after years of abstinence-only education. Louisiana is up there as well with a rate of 27.1 while the new tax-funded voucher schools will have Christian-based textbooks and lesson plans this fall, leaving little room for any discussion of sex beyond “not until you’re married.”

Sex is sex — no matter what word you put before it, the same general risks apply. You can get STIs or HIV from oral sex the same as vaginal sex. Herpes doesn’t go away and Chlamydia can damage reproductive organs. It only takes one exposure to change your life forever.

NewsDay,Brady: Olympics remind us that sports can empower women in developing countries,"The 2012 London Olympics will be remembered for many things: the queen's unprecedented appearance at the opening ceremony, the Olympic torch handed over to the next generation of young athletes, the inspired, record-breaking performances of many, and . . . women. For the first time in Olympic history, the United States sent more female athletes than males to the games. So did Russia, Canada and China.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei sent female athletes for the first time. The addition of women's boxing meant women were competing in all 26 events, another first.

According to the International Olympic Committee's television and marketing department, the dominance of female athletes has sparked a surge in viewership of the games among American girls -- evidence that women's success is already inspiring the next generation. The IOC reported that ratings have been 89 percent higher among 12- to 17-year-old girls than for the hit teen drama ""Glee,"" the highest-rated network show in that demographic. One can only hope that 12-year-old girls around the globe are also able to watch their countrywomen (and men) compete in the international arena.

From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, more girls and women are participating in sports than ever before. Even in the most unlikely settings, girls are stepping onto fields, joining teams and participating in ways that were unprecedented a decade ago.

In recent years, sports have begun to appear on the agenda of many countries and international bodies, as nations have signed on to conventions and frameworks affirming women's and girls' rights (including to sports and physical education). In some countries, laws requiring equal access to sports for girls and women are in place. An increasing array of actors -- public and private sector entities, corporations, community groups, nongovernmental organizations, federations, and athletes -- are promoting girls sports.

Despite these positive developments, the implementation of solid and vibrant sports programs remains a challenge, particularly in developing countries.

It's well known that sports participation benefits physical and mental health. Sports and play also build children's self-confidence, and can reduce post-traumatic stress. And sports programs can be used as venues for delivering information about health, including on avoiding HIV and unintended pregnancy. There's growing evidence that strengthening the ability of children to play enhances their healthy development and builds stronger communities. But if these benefits are to be realized in the developing world, more focused attention on girls' programs is needed.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The emergence of new sports opportunities for girls in the developing world represents a mold-breaking departure from traditional definitions of femininity. Beyond the clear physical and health benefits of sports, participation provides girls with the opportunity to develop new skills, to learn and lead, and to expand and deepen their network of friends. Well-designed and carefully implemented programs for girls can challenge traditional roles for them and break down gender stereotypes; increase girls' visible, active presence in the public sphere; and transform the ways girls think about themselves, and the ways their families and communities view them.

As the momentum around sports for girls and women grows, we must strengthen existing programs, experiment with new ones, and -- important for future advocacy -- document the effects of girls' participation on their health, lives and communities.

As the Olympics demonstrate, there's global interest in women's athletics. This interest can drive the emergence of new programs for girls and women, to their great benefit. How this globalization shapes the way that girls and women perceive, experience and practice sports -- particularly in the developing world -- will be exciting to watch. As the number of girls programs increases over the next decade, we'll see the power of sports to transform girls' and women's lives. With more than 600 million girls in the developing world, the possibilities are endless.

Let the games continue!

U.S., Canada in lobster war

Tensions between lobstermen in Maine and Canada are boiling over in a dispute caused not by too few lobsters but by too many. A potentially record-breaking haul of crustaceans in Maine and Canada this year has caused a market glut and a crash in wholesale prices. Fearing for their livelihood, Canadian fishermen in the past few days have angrily blocked truckloads of Maine lobsters from being delivered to processing plants in Canada that turn out lobster products for U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. Unless something is done to prop up the price of lobster, ""we'll go down the hole,"" warned Eugene Robichaud, a fisherman in Richibucto, New Brunswick. The blockades have brought Canada's lobster-processing industry to a near-standstill, put thousands of employees out of work, sent shock waves through Maine's lobster industry and led to calls for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to intervene.





West Coast gas prices rising

A fire at one of the nation's largest oil refineries helped push West Coast gas prices close to $4 a gallon Thursday, as the same federal team that investigated the Gulf Coast oil spill waited to inspect the unit that was knocked out by the blaze. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board team was standing by with state and company inspectors to do structural and environmental tests to see if it was safe to enter the unit and determine when production might resume after the Monday night blaze. The average price of regular gasoline jumped in California from $3.86 a gallon on Tuesday to $3.94 on Thursday, according to the website GasBuddy.com. Some experts expect the disruption in production to last for weeks and push prices beyond $4 a gallon.

NewsDay,U.S.: Give out more HIV prevention pills,"ATLANTA -- Doctors should consider giving an AIDS prevention pill to women and heterosexual men who are at high risk for getting the virus, U.S. health officials said Thursday.

The government previously advised doctors to give the once-a-day pill Truvada only to high-risk gay and bisexual men. However, more than a quarter of new HIV cases each year are heterosexuals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Truvada has been on the market since 2004 to treat those who have the AIDS virus. After studies showed it could help prevent infection, doctors were told they could prescribe it as a preventive for men at high risk. Since then, studies have found it also can prevent the virus in women and heterosexual men.

The CDC is not recommending the pill for all sexually active heterosexuals. And even among couples in which one person has HIV, regular condom use generally is effective protection.

“Matt Bomer: I don't care how good an actor you are but being married to another man complicates things for playing CG,” he wrote.

There was no denying that the author of “American Psycho,” was once eager to write the screenplay for the highly publicized movie adaptation. Ellis' enthusiasm was displayed through tons of tweets discussing the novel.

In July, the writer also took to Twitter and uploaded photos of actors he thought should play Grey, the novel’s lead male character. One of these actors was Bomer, who in the uploaded photo had a shirt that read “Easton.”

“So is Matt Bomer THE Christian Grey? I think the t-shirt says it all...,” Ellis wrote as a caption.

But apparently Ellis doesn't think so anymore.

“Okay I'll say it. Matt Bomer isn't right for Christian Grey because he is openly gay. He's great for other roles but this is too big a game,” he later added.

NewsDay,Fauci: The end of AIDS is in sight,"Last week, the 19th International AIDS Conference convened in Washington. The last time the meeting took place there was 25 years ago, and the mood was entirely different. In 1987, our scientific knowledge about this exploding epidemic was in its infancy. What has since been accomplished emboldened the organizers to make this year's conference theme ""Turning the Tide Together."" Indeed, there is a possible end to the AIDS pandemic.

The medical advances discussed at the meeting result from a 30-year scientific journey characterized by incremental progress in understanding HIV and how it causes disease, the development of treatments and prevention tools, the testing of these interventions in clinical trials, and implementation of the tools in communities worldwide. Interventions previously proved to work in controlled clinical trials are now -- over and over again -- proving effective outside the research setting, in the real world, in poor and rich communities alike. The pieces are coming together.

More than 8 million people in low- and middle-income countries are receiving lifesaving antiretroviral drugs. These medications averted 840,000 deaths in 2011 alone, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in public health history.

Still, 9 million HIV-infected people who need therapy are not receiving it. In the United States, more than 1.1 million people are infected with HIV, and 20 percent are not aware of it. This group inadvertently transmits the vast majority of the approximately 50,000 new infections that occur annually in the United States. Researchers and health departments are pursuing new approaches to test people for HIV and to provide treatment and care, as well as the support that enables HIV-infected individuals to maximize benefits from medical and social services.

Besides their lifesaving role as treatment, antiretroviral drugs can prevent HIV infection. By significantly lowering virus levels, they dramatically reduce the risk that infected people will transmit HIV to sexual partners or, in the case of pregnant women, to their infants. This concept has been proved in rigorous clinical trials, and new data indicate that the results may be even stronger than earlier reports.

There is also evidence of real-world health benefits at the community, regional and national levels: As antiretroviral coverage has been scaled up, incidence of HIV infection has gone down. Treatment as prevention, if properly implemented and used along with condoms and other proven tools, will significantly slow the trajectory of the pandemic.

Studies have also shown that people at high risk of HIV infection can reduce that risk by taking an antiretroviral pill daily -- a method known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. As with many treatment and prevention tools, the effectiveness of PrEP is directly related to how well people adhere to the prescribed regimen, and behavioral factors must be addressed when rolling out any intervention. Biologically based and behaviorally based interventions are both needed.

While major research challenges remain, notably in developing a vaccine and a cure for HIV, it became clear last week that science has given us the tools we need to dramatically change the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and ultimately end AIDS. Now these tools must be applied.

Ending the HIV pandemic is an enormous and multifaceted challenge. We know it is possible, yet it will not happen spontaneously. It will require a global commitment of countries, governments and communities to strengthen their health care systems and build the capacity to provide HIV treatment and prevention. We need donors and partners to continue their investments, and we need new donor organizations and countries to step up. We must enhance what works and eliminate what doesn't, overcome legal and political barriers, and remove the stigma associated with HIV.

The global community has a historic opportunity based on solid scientific evidence to end the AIDS pandemic, opening the door to an AIDS-free generation.

""She's remorseful and saddened by the impact on her family,"" the lawyer said. ""She has no criminal history.""

The woman received the refund on a debit card and spent about $150,000 before twice reporting the card lost or stolen. At that point the ruse was discovered. The state has recovered about $1.9 million of the money.

An Oregon Department of Revenue spokesman said Tuesday that the findings of an internal agency audit would be released Wednesday.

Reyes filed an electronic tax return in late January via Turbo Tax, erroneously reporting earnings of more than $3 million, authorities have said. Her request for a $2.1 million refund was initially red-flagged by an automated system.

The Oregonian quoted from a 24-page search warrant affidavit regarding what happened next.

The return was set aside for review by processing staff and managers for potential fraud. But ""some time later,"" the affidavit said, a Revenue employee overrode the flagged payment and the refund was issued.

By policy, three agency employees are required to verify the override, the newspaper said. However, according to the affidavit, no one responsible for reviewing the return opened the file to look at it or looked at the W-2 form Reyes filed.

Reyes previously worked at retirement facilities or senior care homes and reported income of less than $15,000 per year in 2009 and 2010, records show.

Before her June 6 arrest, Reyes' spending spree included about $1,800 in cash to buy a 1999 Dodge Caravan and spending $851 on tires and wheels.

The affidavit says other purchases included a queen-sized air mattress, a deep fryer, an air conditioner and a cream and gray floral rug. She bought a sofa and recliner with brown leather trim.

Andrew Campbell, a senior assistant state attorney general who filed the charges against Reyes, declined to comment on Tuesday's plea deal.",26/07/2012
NewsDay,Aging AIDS populations face challenges,"WASHINGTON -- AIDS is graying. By the end of the decade, the government estimates, more than half of Americans living with HIV will be over 50.

Even in developing countries, more people with the AIDS virus are surviving to middle age and beyond.

That's good news, but it's also a challenge. Evidence is growing that people who have spent decades battling the virus may be aging prematurely.

At the International AIDS Conference this week, numerous studies are examining how heart disease, thinning bones and a list of other health problems typically seen in the senior years seem to hit many people with HIV when they're only in their 50s.

""I'm 54, but I feel older,"" said Carolyn Massey of Laurel, Md., who has lived with HIV for nearly 20 years. ""When I hear young people talk about, 'Well you get HIV and you take your drugs and you'll be all right' -- that's just not the truth,"" she said. ""This is a lifelong thing we're talking about, and it unfolds every day on you.""

The graying isn't just because people like Massey are surviving longer. Some older adults are being newly diagnosed, a trend U.S. health officials say is small but slowly growing. Yes, grandparents still have sex, and that's an age group missed by all those hip safe-sex messages aimed at teens and 20-somethings.

""They let down their guard,"" is how Dr. Kevin Fenton of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts it.

Already, a third of the nearly 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States are over 50, and by 2020 half will be, Fenton said at one of numerous sessions on aging at the world's largest AIDS meeting.

People over 50 accounted for 17 percent of new HIV diagnoses in 2009, according to the CDC's latest data. That's up from 13 percent in 2001.

There aren't as good counts in poor regions of the world, where access to lifesaving medications came years later than in developed countries. But even in sub-Saharan Africa, home to most of the world's HIV-infected population, studies suggest 3 million people living with HIV are 50-plus, said Dr. Joel Negin of the University of Sydney in Australia. By 2040, he said, that could reach 9 million.

There, challenges are different. Ruth Waryaro of Kenya, addressing the conference on her 65th birthday, said clinic workers hassle her when she goes to pick up her monthly supply of medication, not believing a grandmother really needs it.

Today, people who are diagnosed and treated early can expect a near-normal life span, Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, told The Associated Press.",26/07/2012
NewsDay,'Wilma' and more Olympic TV biopics,"The Summer Olympics roll into their first full week, and in the spirit of the Games, we offer you these five TV-movie biopics about Olympians:

1. WILMA (1977) chronicled the life of Wilma Rudolph (Shirley Jo Finney), who overcame childhood polio to become the first woman to win three gold medals at one Olympics (the 1960 Rome Games). The cast included Cicely Tyson as Rudolph's mother, and 22-year-old Denzel Washington, in his first credited role.

2. THE JESSE OWENS STORY (1984) -- Dorian Harewood starred as the African-American track star, who dominated the 1936 Berlin Games, much to Hitler's dismay. But the movie focuses mostly on Owens' post-Olympic life, which was clouded by racial prejudice and a 1965 conviction on tax-evasion charges.

3. NADIA (1984) told the story of the 14-year-old Romanian gymnast who received seven perfect 10s at the 1976 Montreal Games. Gymnastics champion Marcia Frederick performed the stunts. Johann Carlo played the older Comaneci and Leslie Weiner was the younger Comaneci.

4. RUN FOR THE DREAM: THE GAIL DEVERS STORY (1996) told the saga of the runner (played by Charlayne Woodard) who overcame Graves' disease (she almost had her legs amputated) to win a gold medal in the 100 meters at the 1992 Barcelona Games.

5. BREAKING THE SURFACE: THE GREG LOUGANIS STORY (1997) -- Mario Lopez played the Olympic diving star who won four gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles and 1988 Seoul Games, while hiding his homosexuality and HIV-positive diagnosis.",26/07/2012
NewsDay,Experts: Sharpen focus in AIDS fight to women,"WASHINGTON -- Tackling the female side of the AIDS epidemic means going far beyond today's global focus on pregnant women, specialists told the world's largest AIDS meeting yesterday.

Already, women make up half the world's HIV infections. Adolescent girls are at particular risk in the hardest-hit parts of the world, and protecting them requires addressing the poverty, violence and discrimination that too many women experience around the world, said UNICEF deputy executive director Geeta Rao Gupta.

""These adolescent girls and young women, our sisters and daughters, represent an unfinished agenda in the AIDS response,"" she told the gathering.

She echoed what has become a recurring theme of the meeting since Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared Monday that gender equity is crucial to protecting women. ""Women need and deserve a voice in the decisions that affect their lives,"" Clinton said.

""The pandemic has a woman's shape,"" said Annah Sango, 24, of Zimbabwe, who learned she had HIV when she was pregnant and watched her husband die of AIDS a few months later. ""We have to reshape our response if we're going to turn the tide.""

Topping the world's anti-AIDS goals for women is the effort to nearly eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The number of babies born with HIV has been dropping steadily for several years as more infected women receive AIDS drugs during pregnancy and while they're nursing -- 57 percent of them last year, according to the United Nations.",25/07/2012
NewsDay,Anti-AIDS vaginal ring study in Africa,"WASHINGTON -- Thousands of women in Africa can volunteer for major new research to see whether inserting a vaginal ring coated with an anti-AIDS drug could protect them from HIV infection, U.S. scientists announced yesterday.

Giving women tools to protect themselves when their partners won't use a condom is crucial for battling the epidemic. Women make up half of the 34.2 million people worldwide living with HIV, even more -- 60 percent -- in hard-hit Africa.

But developing these so-called microbicides has proved a hurdle. Previous research found an anti-AIDS vaginal gel offered partial protection, but women may have a hard time using it every time they have sex. The vaginal ring, in contrast, would have to be inserted just once a month for continuing protection, prompting hope that it will prove more effective.

The device marks an attempt at ""the next generation of women-focused prevention tools,"" Dr. Carl Dieffenbach of the U.S. National Institutes of Health said in announcing the new research at the International AIDS Conference.

""We need options that fit readily into women's lives,"" added Dr. Sharon Hillier of the University of Pittsburgh and the Microbide Trials Network, which is conducting the new NIH-funded study. -- AP",24/07/2012
NewsDay,Teen condom use up over last 20 years,"WASHINGTON -- Nearly half of high school students say they've had sex, yet progress has stalled in getting them to use condoms to protect against AIDS, government researchers reported yesterday.

Today, four of every 10 new HIV infections occur in people younger than 30, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the teen years, just as many youths become sexually active, are key for getting the safe-sex message across.

Using a long-standing survey of high school students' health, the CDC tracked how teen sexual behavior has changed over 20 years. The results are decidedly mixed.

About 60 percent of the sexually active students say they used condoms the last time they had sex, researchers said at the International AIDS Conference. That's up from the 46 percent using them in 1991.

""This is good news,"" said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of CDC's HIV prevention center. But, ""we need to do a lot more."" Condom use hit a high of 63 percent in 2003.

Black students are most likely to heed the safe-sex message, yet their condom use dropped from a high of 70 percent in 1999 to 65 percent last year, the study found.

The proportion of high school students who've had sex is 47 percent today, down from 54 percent in 1991, and they typically start at age 16, CDC said. Black teens showed a bigger decrease, with 60 percent sexually active today, compared with 82 percent two decades ago.

Fifteen percent of high school students say they've had four or more partners, down from 19 percent in 1991.

Fenton said many school systems don't have strong enough sex education policies that include teaching teens about how to prevent HIV. But he cautioned that the CDC study can't link the abstinence-only policies pushed by Congress through the late 1990s and early 2000s to the stalled condom use.

While scientists were releasing new data at the meeting, AIDS activists marched across Washington to the White House to call for increased funding of HIV programs. Thirteen were arrested after tying dollar bills and pill bottles to the executive mansion's fence.",24/07/2012
NewsDay,Anti-gay bill sparks outcry in Ukraine,"KIEV, Ukraine -- If a group of Ukrainian lawmakers succeeds in its mission, TV shows and movies sympathetically portraying homosexuals, such as ""Brokeback Mountain,"" will be banned. So will gay pride parades.

The recently introduced bill, supported by the president's representative in parliament, would impose prison terms of up to five years and unspecified fines for spreading ""propaganda of homosexuality"" -- defined as positive public depiction of gays in public.

It has sparked an outcry from rights organizations in Ukraine and beyond, who condemn the bill as a throwback to Soviet times when homosexuality was a criminal offense. They also warn that harassing the gay community could lead to a spike in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ukraine, one of Europe's most severe, by driving gays further underground.

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in Ukraine and neighboring Russia after the fall of communism, animosity toward gays remains high across the former Soviet sphere.

St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and regarded as one of the country's most sophisticated, passed a law this year mandating fines of up to $33,000 for promoting homosexuality among minors. A gay pride parade in the Georgian capital ended in a scuffle with opponents in March.

The Ukrainian bill follows organizers' decision to cancel the country's first gay-pride parade in May, which they made after hearing that hundreds of potentially violent opponents of gay rights had come to the capital.

Two Ukrainian gay rights activists have been brutally attacked in recent months.

The hostility toward homosexuals raises wider questions about tolerance in Ukraine and whether the country is truly capable of embracing Western values as it strives to join the European Union. In the run-up to last month's European football championship, co-host Ukraine was rocked by allegations of racism, as fans at one stadium performed monkey chants directed at black players.",23/07/2012
NewsDay,A goal of 'AIDS-free generation',"WASHINGTON -- Science now has the tools to slash the spread of HIV even without a vaccine, and the United States is donating an extra $150 million to help poor countries put them in place, the Obama administration told the world's largest AIDS conference yesterday.

""We want to get to the end of AIDS,"" declared the top U.S. HIV researcher, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

How long it takes depends on how quickly the world can adopt those tools, he said -- including getting more of the millions of untreated people onto lifesaving drugs that come with the bonus of keeping them from infecting others.

""No promises, no dates, but we know it can happen,"" Fauci told the International AIDS Conference.

Part of the challenge will be overcoming the stigma that keeps high-risk populations from getting needed AIDS treatment and services.

""We have to replace the shame with love,"" singer Elton John told the conference. ""We have to replace the stigma with compassion. No one should be left behind."" Some 34.2 million people worldwide are living with HIV, and 2.5 million were infected last year.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the goal is an AIDS-free generation. That would mean no babies would be born infected, young people would have a much lower risk than today of becoming infected, and people who already have HIV would receive lifesaving drugs so they wouldn't develop AIDS or spread the virus.

""I am here today to make it absolutely clear the U.S. is committed and will remain committed to achieving an AIDS-free generation,"" Clinton told the more than 20,000 scientists, people living with HIV and policymakers assembled for the conference.

In another development, new research shows black gay men are becoming infected with the AIDS virus at higher rates than their white counterparts, sparking urgent calls to address this growing part of the epidemic.

A study funded by the National Institutes of Health tracked black gay and bisexual men in six cities, and found the rate of new infections is 2.8 percent per year. That's 50 percent higher than is seen in white men who have sex with men.

Worse, among those 30 and younger, nearly 6 percent per year were becoming infected. The authors said those rates rival some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.",23/07/2012
NewsDay,US donates extra $150 million to battle AIDS,"WASHINGTON - Science now has the tools to slash the spread of HIV even without a vaccine — and the U.S. is donating an extra $150 million to help poor countries put them in place, the Obama administration told the world's largest AIDS conference Monday.

""We want to get to the end of AIDS,"" declared the top U.S. HIV researcher, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

How long it takes depends on how quickly the world can adopt those tools, he said — including getting more of the millions of untreated people onto life-saving drugs that come with the bonus of keeping them from infecting others.

""I am here today to make it absolutely clear the U.S. is committed and will remain committed to achieving an AIDS-free generation,"" Clinton told the more than 20,000 scientists, people living with HIV and policymakers assembled for the conference.

But it will require smart targeting of prevention tools where they can have the greatest effect — including to high-risk populations that are particularly hard to reach because of stigma.

""If we want to save more lives, we need to go where the virus is,"" she said.

First, Clinton said it's possible to virtually eliminate the transmission of HIV from infected pregnant women to their babies by 2015, by getting the mothers onto anti-AIDS drugs. HIV-infected births are rare in the United States and are dropping steadily worldwide, although some 330,000 children became infected last year. Clinton said the U.S. has invested more than $1 billion toward that goal in recent years and is providing an extra $80 million to help poor countries finish the job.

Much of the AIDS conference is focused on how to get treatment to all people with HIV, because good treatment can cut by 96 percent their chances of spreading the virus to sexual partners. Fauci pointed to South Africa, where healthy people who live in a region that has increased medication now have a 38 percent lower risk of infection compared with neighbors in an area where HIV treatment is less common.

Drugs aren't the only effective protection. Fauci said male circumcision is ""stunningly successful,"" too, at protecting men from becoming infected by a heterosexual partner. Clinton said the U.S. will provide $40 million to help South Africa reach its goal of providing voluntary circumcision to half a million boys and men this year.

A tougher issue is how best to reach particularly high-risk populations: gay and bisexual men, sex workers and injecting drug users. In many countries, stigma and laws that make their activities illegal drive those populations away from AIDS programs that could teach them how to reduce their risk of infection, Clinton said.

""If we're going to beat AIDS, we can't afford to avoid sensitive conversations, and we can't afford not to reach the people who are at the highest risk,"" she said.

So the U.S. will spend an additional $15 million on research to identify the best HIV prevention tools to reach those key populations in different countries, and then launch a $20 million challenge fund to support country-led efforts to implement that science.

The Obama administration already has been urging the countries that receive AIDS funding to target these specific populations, but dedicated money to address how to reach them is crucial, said Chris Collins of amFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.

Money is a big challenge during a global recession — and for countries weary of the fight against a disease with an ever-growing number of people who need care

The world spent $16.8 billion fighting AIDS in poor countries, the hardest-hit, last year. But that's still $7 billion a year shy of the amount needed to nearly double the 8 million people getting life-saving drugs by the world's goal of 2015.

""This gap is killing people,"" UNAIDS chief Michel Sidibe told the conference. ""My friends, the end of AIDS is not free. It is not too expensive. It is priceless.""",23/07/2012
NewsDay,World AIDS conference begins in Washington,"WASHINGTON -- From dark days to a critical turning point in the AIDS epidemic: The landscape has changed dramatically since the world's largest AIDS conference last met in the United States.

Back in 1990, the first good medicines were still a few years away. Before they arrived, caring for patients with HIV was like ""putting Band-Aids on hemorrhages,"" said the leading U.S. AIDS researcher, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

Fast forward: Today's anti-AIDS drugs work so well they not only give people with HIV a near-normal life expectancy, but also offer a double whammy, making those patients less likely to infect other people.

The International AIDS Conference opened Sunday, in the nation's capital, with the goal of ""turning the tide"" on HIV. Even without a vaccine or a cure, the goal is to finally stem the spread of the virus, using that so-called ""treatment as prevention"" and other protections.

But the challenge that more than 20,000 scientists, doctors, people living with HIV and policy-makers will grapple with this week is how to get to what the Obama administration calls an AIDS-free generation. Where's the money? What works best in different countries and cultures?

And with HIV increasingly an epidemic of the poor and the marginalized, will countries find the will to invest in the most vulnerable?

Such political commitment must expand to fight laws that are driving some of the populations most at risk -- gay and bisexual men, sex workers and injecting drug users -- away from programs that could help protect them from getting or spreading HIV, said Michel Sidibe, director of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program.

""It's outrageous that in 2012, when we have everything to beat this epidemic, that we still have to fight prejudice, stigma, exclusion,"" he said.

People with HIV marched through Washington Sunday to urge policy-makers to pay attention to a disease that, in this country, doesn't get much publicity anymore. ""We're everyday people. Anybody and everybody can catch this,"" said Ann Dixon, who traveled from Arkansas.

NewsDay,Greg Louganis back in US diving fold for Olympics,"Greg Louganis knows what it's like to be perfect. And he's concerned that kind of pressure will be the undoing of a lot of athletes at the London Olympics.

He's trying to make sure the stress of winning medals isn't heaped on the shoulders of American divers, who have been chasing his standard of excellence since Louganis became the sport's icon in the 1980s. The U.S. has been blanked in diving in two consecutive Olympics, and hasn't won a gold since 2000.

The man who won four Olympic gold medals and resembled a Greek god while spinning off the 3-meter springboard and 10-meter platform is back in the fold at his first games with USA Diving working as an athlete mentor.

""I'm hoping it's not too little, too late,"" Louganis said at last month's U.S. diving trials near Seattle.

He came on board last year -- late in the four-year Olympic cycle -- after being invited by Steve Foley, an Australian who had taken over as USA Diving's high performance director from Ron O'Brien, Louganis' former coach.

It marked a reunion between Louganis and the sport's U.S. governing body after years of separation, which he attributes to not being invited and not feeling welcome.

Louganis thinks it was made possible because he stopped coaching after briefly working with a diving club in Fullerton, Calif., last year. Not coaching meant he wasn't a threat to other coaches, who feared Louganis' reputation would lure their divers away. He thought doing both would be a conflict of interest.

""I'm not coaching dives, I'm observing and making recommendations of what I see, of what they may be able to add to enhance their training programs,"" he said.

More important to Louganis, and what he most enjoys, is being able to share his experiences, including successes and failures, with the current generation of U.S. divers. He will be in London during the games and afterward he'll attend a camp for young British divers.

""I make myself available to kids to be able to talk about their home life, their school, their boyfriends, girlfriends, their potential professional life after diving, agents,"" he said. ""I have those experiences that some of the other kids might be going through that I can share; it opens the door to say I'm a safe place because I've been there."" Where he's been was about as low as a person can go. Louganis revealed much of his personal turmoil in his 1995 autobiography, ""Breaking the Surface."" There was emotional abuse by his father, physical and sexual abuse by a partner, depression, addiction to alcohol and painkillers, and the most shocking details of all -- he was gay and HIV positive, something he chose not to disclose to the U.S. Olympic Committee before the 1988 Seoul Olympics and was later harshly criticized for.

""I've been to those dark places, but I came up on the other side,"" he said. ""It gives an opportunity of realizing that there might be something else."" Most of today's divers weren't born when Louganis was making history as the only male diver to win consecutive Olympic gold medals in both springboard and platform diving.

""They know me from YouTube. They're impressed with that,"" he said, smiling. ""Not that they read a whole lot, but you can read it in the record books."" The topic most of them ask about is when Louganis hit his head on the springboard while leading the preliminaries in Seoul. Barely 30 minutes later, he returned to compete and notched the highest score ever in a qualifying round. He went on to win the gold.

""That baffled a lot of people,"" the 52-year-old former champion said. ""It's something that they're very curious about."" Among the current Olympians he's worked with are David Boudia, Nick McCrory and Troy Dumais, the only American man besides Louganis to make four Olympic diving teams.

""I love him,"" Louganis said of Dumais, who often quoted his mentor's advice during the U.S. trials.

""Even Greg Louganis said put your best dive last,"" Dumais said in switching the order of his list.

Louganis' Olympic success set the bar so high that no one has yet equaled it. But he says today's divers are better than he was.

""They're doing a higher degree of difficulty, they're getting higher scores,"" he said.

Synchronized diving has been added to the Olympic program since Louganis retired, creating four more events.

""That would have been a blast,"" he said. ""I would have loved that."" Louganis describes his mentoring work as a ""crash course"" in trying to tweak the mindsets of U.S. divers who might be obsessed with perfection.

""It's not perfection that wins a medal. It's generally who makes the fewest mistakes,"" he said.

And if he can move the USOC's focus even slightly away from winning the medal count, then Louganis will feel better.

""That is not where the heads of the athlete need to be,"" he said. ""Unless you perform, the medals aren't going to come. The thing that I'm most concerned about is the aftercare."" He cites the suicide of freestyle skier Jeret ""Speedy"" Peterson last July and the death of former Olympic champion diver Mark Lenzi this year as examples of athletes who could have used help transitioning to the real world after retirement.

""It's a little unnerving because the USOC is so focused on the Olympians, and there's a lot of kids who don't quite make it as an Olympian and they're going through a lot of the same things,"" he said.

Louganis also works with the U.S. Olympians Association, a support network for former Olympic athletes. In his new roles, he feels relaxed and empowered because he's doing it his way.

""If I see something that's not quite right I'll call it out. People are going to get (angry) at me and that's OK,"" he said. ""I got so much (grief) for coming out from USA Diving, but on the flip side of that, I've been getting notes from kids who are saying, 'You saved my life.""' Louganis said his pull-no-punches approach seems to be working with the powers that be.

""I think they're receptive to it because I don't think they're accustomed to straight talk,"" he said. ""It's like, 'Wow.' I know it's right in my heart, whether it's politically correct, I really don't care. Right is right.""",19/07/2012
NewsDay,Injured Halle Berry out of hospital,"Halle Berry was out of the hospital Wednesday after being treated and released for a minor head injury Tuesday on the Los Angeles set of her latest movie.

Oscar-winner Berry, 45, was injured ""while shooting a fight sequence on the set of her film 'The Hive,' "" her spokeswoman said in a statement. ""She was taken to the hospital as a precaution, but she checked out healthy and was released. She'll continue production as planned.""

Berry's representative did not say when the incident occurred or where the actress was treated. TMZ.com said an ambulance rushed Berry to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at about 10 p.m. Tuesday after she developed possible concussion symptoms following a fall on concrete.

NewsDay,Dutch to investigate needles in sandwiches,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch police investigating how needles got into six turkey sandwiches on Delta Air Lines flights from Amsterdam to U.S. cities said yesterday that the sandwiches and needles are being flown back to the Netherlands for tests.

Spokesman Robert van Kapel told The Associated Press that police at Schiphol Airport are taking the lead in the investigation and cooperating with the FBI.

He said the sandwiches will undergo forensic tests. Police were interviewing staff at the catering company that made the sandwiches in a kitchen near Schiphol Airport, as well as Delta staff.

A Delta spokeswoman said the needles were found Sunday in six sandwiches on flights to Minneapolis, Seattle and Atlanta. Passengers discovered four of them.

The sandwiches were made by Gate Gourmet, one of the world's largest airline caterers. The company serves many airlines, but only Delta flights appeared to be affected.

Delta spokeswoman Kristin Baur said security has been stepped up at Gate Gourmet facilities used by the airline.

Passenger Jim Tonjes, biting into a hot turkey sandwich on a Delta flight over the United States, felt a jab in his mouth and thought a toothpick holding the sandwich together had punctured the roof of his mouth. When he pulled it out, ""it was a straight needle, about one inch long, with sharp points on both ends.""

Now Tonjes is on a 28-day course of pills aimed at warding off any infection, including hepatitis or HIV.",18/07/2012
NewsDay,UN: Progress against HIV in poor countries,"WASHINGTON -- A push to get more AIDS treatment to the world's poorest, hardest-hit countries is paying off as deaths inch down -- and new infections are dropping a bit, too, the United Nations reported yesterday.

""I personally believe it is a new era, new era for treatment, new era for prevention,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS.

Some 34.2 million people worldwide were living with the AIDS virus at the end last year, a slight rise from 2010 as better treatment helps patients live longer.

Most of them live in low- and middle-income countries, where a record 8 million people received lifesaving drugs last year. That's up from 6.6 million in 2010, and puts the world on track to meet a UN goal of 15 million people in those regions on treatment by 2015.

The report came days before the world's largest AIDS conference opens in Washington with the goal of finally ""turning the tide."" -- AP",18/07/2012
NewsDay,UN: progress against HIV in poor countries,"WASHINGTON - A record 8 million people with HIV in poor countries were receiving potentially life-saving treatment last year and new infections among children are dropping steadily, the United Nations said Wednesday, in an encouraging report on the AIDS epidemic.

The report comes days before the world's largest AIDS conference opens in the nation's capital with the goal of finally ""turning the tide"" on the epidemic, citing research that's possible to dramatically stem the spread of the HIV virus.

""The world deserves no less than a future of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths,"" Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, wrote in Wednesday's report.

The world is nowhere near that ideal yet: Some 34.2 million people are living with the AIDS virus globally, including 2.5 million who became infected last year. And 1.7 million died in 2011. New infections and deaths dropped slightly last year.

But the report found progress toward some interim goals.

More than 8 million people with HIV in poor and middle-income countries received AIDS medications last year, up from 6.6 million in 2010, said the report from UNAIDS, the United Nations program on HIV and AIDS. At that rate, the world should meet a U.N. goal of having 15 million people in those countries on treatment by 2015, the report found.

Increasing access to treatment doesn't just save the lives of people living with HIV. New research shows that treating them early so they stay healthy also makes them far less likely to infect others, a strategy called ""treatment as prevention.""

""We need to get that number up as rapidly as possible,"" said Chris Collins of amFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, who called the 2011 treatment increase unexpectedly high. ""If we can get to scale with AIDS treatment, we're not only saving lives but we're preventing infection and beginning to end this epidemic.""

Another key goal: To nearly eliminate new HIV infections among children by 2015, including transmission during pregnancy.

About 330,000 children were newly infected in 2011, a 24 percent drop since 2009, the report found. Nearly 60 percent of the 1.5 million pregnant women living with HIV in poor countries received effective anti-AIDS medications last year, to lower their chances of infecting their babies.",18/07/2012
NewsDay,Halle Berry hospitalized after accident on set of 'The Hive',"LOS ANGELES - Halle Berry suffered a minor head injury during a movie-shoot fight sequence and was treated at a Los Angeles hospital and released.

Berry's Los Angeles publicist Meredith O'Sullivan says the 45-year-old actress suffered the injury Tuesday night on the set of her upcoming movie ""The Hive."" She was taken to a hospital as a precaution but was released a short time later.

O'Sullivan says Berry will continue work on the film.

The celebrity website x17online.com and TMZ.com were first to report the news, saying Berry was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at about 10 p.m. O'Sullivan wouldn't confirm the name of the hospital.

NewsDay,Feds bust prescription drug scheme,"A massive prescription drug diversion racket recycled more than $500 million in high-end secondhand drugs, paid for by Medicaid, through an underground interstate network and resold them as new to unwitting customers at pharmacies, law enforcement officials in New York charged yesterday.

Prosecutors accused more than 40 individuals with scheming to buy costly drugs for asthma, HIV and schizophrenia worth $1,000 or more a bottle at steep discounts from Medicaid recipients in poor city neighborhoods, relabel them and then launder them through corrupt distributors in the Southwest back into the retail market at full price.

Displaying pictures of heaps of the roughly 30,000 bottles and 250,000 loose pills seized in raids piled up like multicolored jelly beans, officials described the diversion scheme as ""bad medicine"" -- ""obscenely"" profitable and dangerous.

""People with real ailments were induced to sell their medications on the cheap rather than take them as prescribed, while end users of the diverted drugs were getting secondhand medicine that may have been mishandled, adulterated, improperly stored, repackaged and expired,"" said Janice Fedarcyk, the top New York FBI agent.

Federal agents began investigating the black market operation in late 2010 based on informant tips, but NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said fortuitous police work -- like a Bronx traffic stop that led to the discovery of 2,000 bottles of AIDS medicine -- also helped.

The 48 individuals charged Tuesday included several networks of ""collectors"" -- who trolled pharmacies and bodegas in Washington Heights, the Bronx and elsewhere to find sick Medicaid recipients willing to sell their drugs.

The defendants, 16 from New York and New Jersey and others from as far away as Florida and Texas, also included low- and high-level ""aggregators"" who paid multiple collectors for their hauls, used lighter fluid to remove patient labels, and replaced damaged manufacturer labels with counterfeits.

At the top of the pyramid: so-called corrupt distributors who bought from the aggregators and resold to licensed distributors. Prosecutors charged several men associated with a distribution operation in Sugarland, Texas, and prosecutors said others were under scrutiny.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a news conference that no beneficiaries, whose prescriptions were paid for by Medicaid, were charged.

He said they were likely people in such ""dire straits"" that a few dollars were more important than the medication. Kelly said they would sell a drug like the HIV drug Kaletra, listed by Medicaid at $650, for as little as $50 a bottle.

No pharmacies were charged either, but Bharara responded to questions by emphasizing that the investigation is ongoing. ""Pharmacies have an absolute responsibility . . . to not look the other way,"" he said, adding, ""You should expect other shoes to drop.""

One complaint filed Tuesday said the corrupt distributors in Sugarland received more than $9 million over a six-month period from a licensed national drug distributor in St. George, Utah, which in turn did $8 million in business with a New York-based pharmacy management business specializing in AIDS patients. Both companies were not named.

Although mishandling of the drugs presented risks, Bharara said there was no evidence so far that anyone was harmed by a secondhand drug.

How the scheme worked

Medicaid beneficiaries filled prescriptions for monthlong supplies of drugs at pharmacies and used Medicaid benefits to pay for them at little or no cost to themselves.

The beneficiaries, usually AIDS patients, sold the bottles of medications for cash to ""collectors"" at pharmacies, street corners or bodegas in Upper Manhattan or the Bronx.

To maximize their profits, the participants in the scheme dealt with the most expensive drugs, such as the HIV medication Atripla, which has a Medicaid reimbursement of $1,635 a bottle.

The collectors sold the bottles of pills to ""aggregators"" who then sold them to other aggregators farther up the distribution chain who bought and amassed large amounts of pills.

The highest level aggregators then sold the drugs to nationwide distribution channels. They controlled wholesale prescription drug distribution companies that sold the drugs to pharmacies and other wholesale prescription drug companies.

Pharmacies then dispensed these resold drugs to unsuspecting consumers.

NewsDay,"Truvada isn't a cure, but it's a milestone in how we think about HIV","There are two medical milestones to applaud in the detection and prevention of the decades-long HIV epidemic now that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Truvada.

The revolutionary in-home test kit came early in July, giving those in doubt and at risk of the virus the ability to test themselves discreetly. Then Monday, the FDA approved Truvada, the first pill to reduce the risk of HIV infection after sexual exposure, but this isn't a foolproof - or cheap - way to avoid the virus.

It has been approved and used for treating patients with HIV since 2004, but two large clinical trials have shown the drug can also be used to prevent the virus. The first was for ""men who have sex with men"" and, when taken as prescribed, the risk of infection was reduced by 42 percent. The second involved heterosexual couples with one infected partner and the risk dropped to 75 percent with the regular use of condoms.

Truvada is not a vaccine that prevents HIV, nor is it a cure. Those prescribed it are advised not to see it as a license to practice unsafe sex but many fear that's what some will do. The FDA approval comes with a plan that includes regular testing every three months and education about how it works, when it should be taken, and what the risks are.

Manufacturer Gilead Sciences estimates that the annual cost of the medication for the patient will be about $13,900. Since the drug costs more than some cars, the approval of its preventative qualities gives insurance companies the ability and opportunity to cover those who are not diagnosed with HIV. Many major insurance companies, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, should seriously consider covering the drug. Smaller companies like Harvard Pilgrim Health Care immediately responded to the approval of Truvada by adding it to the list of HIV treatments already covered, reducing the cost to about $25 or $30 a month for the patient, or $360 a year.

There are dissenters. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the nation's largest education and advocacy group, tore the FDA apart. Foundation president Michael Weinstein called the decision a ""catastrophe"" in the fight against HIV according to the Los Angeles Times. He’s concerned the drug won’t be used properly and that the FDA doesn’t have enough information to release it to the public.

Still, most health officials and advocacy groups praise the decision, saying it can save lives. James Loduca, vice president of public affairs at the San Francisco AIDS foundation, says the approval of Truvada as a preventative medication is a ""watershed moment"" in the long battle against HIV.

One pill isn’t going to eradicate HIV overnight, but any new treatments or methods that could work need to be tried. The infection rate - and death rate - remain high.

Condoms are still needed, as is more widespread education about HIV. Still, something as simple as a daily pill could drastically change the statistics and the way we look at HIV.

NewsDay,48 charged in massive Medicaid fraud case,"NEW YORK - Federal agents and New York City police say 48 people are charged in a $108 million Medicaid fraud case.

Authorities say the arrests on Tuesday are the result of an investigation of a so-called ""pill diversion"" scheme. The scheme involved obtaining medication for such ailments as HIV and asthma from Medicaid recipients. They were then channeled to a distributor who resold them to pharmacies.",17/07/2012
NewsDay,FDA approves HIV-prevention drug,"WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first drug shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection, a milestone in the 30-year battle against the virus that causes AIDS.

Gilead Sciences' pill Truvada was approved Monday as a preventive measure for healthy people at high risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity, such as those who have HIV-infected partners. The decision comes less than two weeks after the agency approved another landmark product: the first over-the-counter HIV test that can be developed at home.

The developments are seen as the biggest steps in years toward curbing the spread of HIV in the United States, which has held steady at about 50,000 new infections a year for 15 years. An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, which develops into AIDS unless treated with antiviral drugs. An estimated 240,000 HIV carriers are unaware they are infected.

Public health advocates said Truvada represents a major breakthrough, both as a medical treatment and as a means of expanding other preventive measures.

Patients who get a prescription for Truvada will be expected to take part in a comprehensive HIV prevention plan, which experts say will enhance the drug's impact.

""It really marks a new era in HIV prevention because in adding Truvada as a prevention strategy, what comes with it is expanded access to HIV testing, condoms and prevention counseling and support,"" said James Deluca, vice president of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.

HIV experts have raised concerns that patients might not use the drug correctly. Dr. Tom Giordano of Baylor College of Medicine said the drug must be taken every day to be effective, and would be most effective for a relatively small group of people.

""It's been most effective in people who are at very high risk and are able to take the drug on a regular basis,"" said Giordano, who was on the FDA panel that recommended approval. ""When you really boil it down, that's going to be a relatively focused population, but it's an important population to treat.""

NewsDay,Gates Foundation pledges $1 billion for contraceptives,"SEATTLE - The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will spend more than $1 billion over the next eight years to help boost access to contraceptives in the developing world and research new methods of birth control.

Melinda Gates made the announcement Wednesday at a family planning summit in London chaired jointly by her Seattle-based foundation and the British government.

The new funding level represents a doubling of Gates spending for family planning and puts the topic on a par with some of the foundation’s other top priorities, including work on vaccines and treatments for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.

Gates said she and her husband, the Microsoft co-founder, always strive to make sure their philanthropic money is put to the best use.

“When Bill and I discussed this at home, we had absolutely no hesitation in making this decision,” Melinda Gates said at the summit, which was streamed live on the Web.

Giving women access to contraceptives will reduce unwanted pregnancies, slash the number of women who die in childbirth and reduce abortions, she said.

“Family planning leads to more prosperous families, and at the national level, it’s even linked to increased GDP growth,” she said.

The London summit exceeded its goal of raising $4.3 billion in pledges from nations, foundations and companies, to make contraceptives available to an additional 120 million women in the poorest parts of the world.

Developing countries pledged $2 billion, while wealthy nations and foundations agreed to ante up $2.6 billion, said Andrew Mitchell, the United Kingdom’s International Development Secretary.

The biggest single commitment was from the U.K. government, which pledged an increase of $800 million over the next eight years, bringing the nation’s total spending to $1.6 billion. The U.S. government, the world’s biggest funder of international family planning programs, did not pledge any additional money.

The Gates Foundation will spend $140 million a year for the next eight years, up from the current funding level of $70 million a year. Since its inception in the mid 1990s, the foundation has spent about $1 billion on family planning and birth control.",12/07/2012
NewsDay,EXCERPT: 'Monkey Mind' by Daniel Smith,"WHY I AM QUALIFIED TO WRITE THIS BOOK

About ten years ago, when I was living in Boston, I had a therapist whose office was in a clinic across the Charles River, at the top of a tall hill. The therapist, whose name was Brian, had a beard and moustache the color of ripe mangoes, and in his spare time he acted in community theater. Often the productions Brian performed in had historical settings, and he would groom his facial hair accordingly. Brian was the best therapist I've ever had, compassionate and patient and wise. But his appearance could be unsettling. One month, as opening night for ""The Secret Garden"" approached, he trimmed his beard progressively thinner while he grew his moustache thick, extending it down along the sides of his mouth. It was like getting counseling from General Custer.

I had started going to Brian because I was deeply anxious. I'd been so before. This was my third and most serious bout with acute anxiety, and as with the others, my condition seemed disconnected from the facts of my life. I had graduated from college the year before, with honors. I had a prestigious job, loyal friends, a good apartment I shared with a bright and beautiful girlfriend, and as much money as I needed. Yet every day was torture. I slept fitfully, with recurring nightmares -- tsunamis, feral animals, the violent deaths of loved ones. I had intestinal cramps and nausea and headaches. A sense of impending catastrophe colored every waking moment. Worse, I had the distinct sense that catastrophe had already occurred. I had made the wrong decisions, gone down the wrong path, screwed up in a ruinous, irrevocable, epoch-making way.

One afternoon, in this state of mind, I walked to therapy. My weekly walks were perilous in that without the distraction of work I was free to berate myself with impunity. There was no need even to concentrate on where I was going -- the way to Brian's office lay on the Freedom Trail, a two-and-a-half-mile-long path marked by a painted red line that leads through some of the most famous landmarks of the American Revolution. Boston's beloved Freedom Trail: the Commons, the Granary Burying Ground, the Old South Meeting House, the Old North Church, the U.S.S. Constitution, . . . Brian's office. It was as if the entire experiment in American democracy was fated to culminate in my recovery.

Anxiety is the most common of psychological complaints, not only the clinical condition that applies to the most people (nearly three of every ten Americans), but, it's often said, a universal and insoluble feature of modern life. Everyone has it; everyone must deal with it. While the corollary to this is that everyone's anxiety is different, shot through with idiosyncratic concerns and confusions, the experience is unified by its painfully hermetic character. Anxiety compels a person to think, but it is the type of thinking that gives thinking a bad name: solipsistic, self- eviscerating, unremitting, vicious. My walks to therapy, for example, were spent outlining with great logical precision the manner in which my state of mind would lead me to complete existential ruin. A typical line of thought went something like this: I am anxious. The anxiety makes it impossible to concentrate. Because it is impossible to concentrate, I will make an unforgivable mistake at work. Because I will make an unforgivable mistake at work, I will be fired. Because I will be fired, I will not be able to pay my rent. Because I will not be able to pay my rent, I will be forced to have sex for money in an alley behind Fenway Park. Because I will be forced to have sex for money in an alley behind Fenway Park, I will contract HIV. Because I will contract HIV, I will develop full-blown AIDS. Because I will develop full-blown AIDS, I will die disgraced and alone.

From freeform anxiety to death-by-prostitution in eight short steps. Most weeks, I found that I could kill myself off before I'd crossed the bridge into Charlestown. This gave me a half a mile to fully experience the ignominy of my downfall: to see my mother wailing like a Sicilian peasant over my lime-complected corpse, to see the rabbi eulogizing my unfulfilled promise, to hear the thump of dirt on unfinished pine, to accompany my two brothers as they rush home from graveside to pull the plastic wrap off the cold-cut platters and switch on the coffee urn. Meanwhile, mounting the hill to the clinic, near-horizontal against the angle of ascent, I would do my best to weep -- for cathartic purposes. These were pathetic attempts at weeping, the bleaty cries of someone who has wept himself dry, like an ape laughing: ""Hunh! Hunh! Hunh!"" Sweaty with strain and agitation, I would try to manufacture bona fide tears and always I would fail. By the time I arrived at the clinic I was typically so demoralized I could barely stand. I was twenty-three years old and I looked like Nixon resigning the presidency.

My opening monologues in therapy, like my en route self-destructions, rarely varied. I would open by insisting that I was a thoroughgoing wreck. My anxiety had grown so intense over the preceding week that I could no longer in good faith work. The only honorable thing for me to do was to leave my job. Following that, I would insist that my pain was so acute that it surely signaled legitimate insanity of one stripe or another, and that it would border on malpractice for Brian to continue to see me as an outpatient; what I required was hospitalization, preferably at an institution with manicured grounds and nurses who wore starched white hats with red crosses embroidered on them. Finally, I would plead for help. I would insist that Brian tell me what to do. Please, I would say. Please. Just tell me what to do. I can't do this on my own. I'm not capable. Tell me what I need to do. I'll do anything. Please. I'm begging you. Please. What should I do?

It was at some point during this opening speech, on the afternoon I am talking about, that Brian interrupted and asked if he could film me. Brian taught graduate students, he explained, and he sometimes used videotaped sessions during his seminars, for training purposes.

""You want to tape me?"" I asked.

""For training purposes,"" he said. ""You can say no, of course.""

""I can?"" I said. ""I can say no?""

""Yes, of course.""

""It would be all right?""

""Yes.""

""You'd still be able to teach?""

""Yes.""

""So it's OK?""

""Yes.""

""No.""

And so we carried on as if he had never made the request. For the forty or so minutes remaining in the session I sat wretched with hopelessness as Brian nodded and made maddeningly benign facial expressions, as was his habit. Then I retraced the steps of Paul Revere and Sam Adams and all the rest of the great patriots, this time in reverse, and returned to the office for the few terrible hours remaining in my professional day.

It was only later, while riding home on the train to hide under the covers until morning, that I realized why Brian had wanted to tape me. It was the same thing that had happened to my brother David, years earlier. When he was in grade school, David had severe buck teeth, broad and walrus-long. His overbite was so pronounced that our orthodontist, when he had finally managed to correct the problem, used a plaster cast of David's teeth as a display during lectures at conferences, as if to say to the world of corrective dentistry, ""Behold, people! This is how bad it can get!""

My case, I realized, was Brian's bucktooth mold. I was the clinical example: the etching of the arch-backed epileptic; the lithograph of the withered, birth-defected arm; the tumor with lips and a tongue; the six-eyed, noseless, baguette-shaped head in the jar.

I was anxiety personified.

NewsDay,HIV testing catches up with technology with new home kit,"HIV — the human immunodeficiency virus — was a death sentence in the '80s and '90s, but advances in medicine give people hope. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been working to make testing for the virus more available and discreet.

The FDA approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test Tuesday, giving those most at risk, who many never get tested elsewhere, an opportunity to test themselves discreetly at home. The kits should be available by October in more than 30,000 stores and online.

The process is simple: swab gums, place swab in vial, wait 20 to 40 minutes, check results. Much like a pregnancy test, one line equals negative and two lines equal positive.

One of the main problems with the spread of a virus that is preventable is the lack of knowledge about HIV. Manufacturer OraSure Technology is creating a customer support hotline, available 24/7 starting July 9, to provide information about HIV, help customers understand the procedure, guide callers after receiving results and offer referrals.

The FDA also approved an in-home test kit in 1996, but the results had to be mailed to a lab for processing. These kits still exist with a price tag of around $50 and samples still have to be mailed to a lab, but overnight shipping is included in the purchase and results are available in 24 hours.

The CDC, along with Walgreens, is about to launch a program to deliver free HIV tests to a limited number of pharmacies and clinics across the country. Select pharmacies at Walgreens in Washington D.C., Chicago, Ill., and Lithonia, Ga. are offering free tests as a trial run.

Patients will be able to discreetly request the test with forms similar in size and shape of business cards. Of the 1.2 million Americans infected, one in five is unaware of the infection and one in three is diagnosed so late that the patient develops acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

Many people go untested because of the stigma of the illness and the fear of getting a positive result. Hopefully, these two new options will help dismiss such ideas and get more citizens involved and aware.

NewsDay,Pick your own lavender on the East End,"The intoxicating scent beckons travelers on Route 25 to its sea of ravishing purple. That's the lure of lavender at Lavender by the Bay, an East Marion farm where patrons can pick their own plant bunches from the field.

""It's absolutely gorgeous. I could smell it from a half-mile away,"" says David Luhrs, 44, of Randolph, Mass., who, with wife Danielle, 51, met his Bay Shore parents at the farm one recent afternoon. ""We've got a 6 o'clock ferry, but we made sure we had enough time for this.""

WHAT TO EXPECT

As the only lavender farm on Long Island, Lavender by the Bay attracts both locals and out-of-towners. With 17 acres of about 25 lavender varieties, there's plenty to select for baking, planting or scenting your home. Peak lavender picking is through this weekend, but lavender should be available through July 15.

You know it's ripe when the bees are all abuzz. They extract pollen and carry it to the farm's 20 hives to produce lavender honey, says Serge Rozenbaum, who owns the farm with his wife, Susan. ""Listen to the music of the bees,"" Serge says in a thick Parisian accent, standing in the field. ""It's like a helicopter landing zone.""

While bees may make some nervous, Susan says they're not drawn to patrons; they're after the lavender. She keeps lavender oil nearby just in case, because it is ""very good for insect bites."" That's part of the spiel offered to new lavender pickers. Patrons receive a wicker basket and sickle, as Susan briefly instructs on how to harvest. ""You want to cut as long a stem as you can, without cutting into the woody part of the plant,"" she says. Then visitors are free to let loose in a roped-off area.

For Mae Weed, the fields were a great backdrop for photos, in which she posed wearing a brightly colored floral dress. ""I wore this just to come here,"" says Weed, 49, of Bayside. ""It's a pretty beautiful site.""

Meanwhile, Weed's 9-year-old son, Adam Murray, was happy to get active. ""It gets your body running,"" he says. ""And you get to bring home a reward.""

AT THE FARM

Lavender plants bloom in neat rows, sprouting nearly knee-high above black ground covers that keep the weeds away (the Rozenbaums don't spray pesticides). The stems sway from side to side when an afternoon breeze hits. It's a scene that looks like an impressionist painting -- something far more expansive than the garden the Rozenbaums started 20 years ago on sandy soil at their Southold residence. When friends and neighbors tired of the free lavender, the pair put it on a bench in front of their home with a can and a ""Lavender for Sale"" sign, Serge says. ""We went to the beach and when we came back there was money in the can, and we realized there was potential,"" he says.

At the farm's store -- full of lavender honey, sachets handmade by Susan and even lavender cake -- potential is evident. Crystelle Cava, 28, of West Islip, browsed for goodies with husband Mario and 14-month-old Graciana. Crystelle Cava keeps bushels of lavender in her kitchen, satchels in her drawers and buys baking lavender for lavender lemonade and scones. ""I actually have it over my linen cabinet too, so whenever I take the sheets out . . . it brushes against the lavender,"" she says. ""It's just so relaxing.""

NewsDay,Home AIDS test approved by FDA,"WASHINGTON -- Americans will soon be able to test themselves in the privacy of their homes for the virus that causes AIDS, now that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first rapid, over-the-counter HIV test.

The OraQuick test detects the presence of HIV antibodies using a mouth swab and returns a result in 20 to 40 minutes.

Government officials estimate that about 240,000 people, or one-fifth of the roughly 1.2 million people carrying HIV in the U.S., don't know they are infected. Testing is a chief means of slowing new infections, which have held steady at about 50,000 per year for two decades.

FDA officials said the test is designed for people who might not otherwise get tested.

""The availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate,"" said Dr. Karen Midthun, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Orasure plans to start selling the test in October, both online and through retailers like Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. It hasn't set a price yet but expects the consumer version to cost less than $60. That's substantially more than the one for about $17.50 marketed to health professionals. Chief executive Doug Michels said the higher price will help pay for a toll-free call center to provide counseling and medical referrals to test users.

""Each of the call-center operators is bilingual in English and Spanish, they've gone through 160 hours of training on HIV counseling and testing,"" Michels said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""So they are highly trained professionals and they'll be there to support the consumer.""

Michels said the company's marketing efforts will focus on populations at greatest risk of being infected with HIV, including gay and bisexual men, African Americans and Hispanics.

The FDA stressed that the test is not 100 percent accurate. Orasure's trials showed OraQuick detected HIV in those carrying the virus 92 percent of the time, though it was 99.9 percent accurate in ruling out those who didn't have the virus.

That means the test could miss one in 12 HIV-infected people who use it.But it would incorrectly identify only one person as having HIV for every 5,000 HIV-negative people tested, the FDA said.

People who test negative should get re-tested after three months, because it can take several weeks for detectable antibodies to HIV to appear, according to Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's HIV unit.",03/07/2012
NewsDay,CDC tries out free AIDS tests at drugstores,"ATLANTA -- Getting an AIDS test at the drugstore could become as common as a flu shot or blood pressure check, if a new pilot program takes off.

The $1.2 million program will offer free rapid HIV tests at pharmacies and in-store clinics in 24 cities and rural communities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced yesterday.

""We believe we can reach more people by making testing more accessible and reduce the stigma associated with HIV,"" Dr. Kevin Fenton, who oversees the agency's HIV prevention programs, said.

The tests are already available at seven places, including Washington, D.C.; Oakland, Calif.; and a health service clinic in Montana. The CDC will soon pick 17 more locations.

The test is a swab inside the mouth; it takes about 20 minutes for a preliminary result. The test maker says it's correct 99 percent of the time.

If the test is positive for the AIDS virus, pharmacy employees will refer customers to a local health department or other health care providers for a lab blood test to confirm the results, and to offer counseling and treatment. The workers are expected to deliver the news face to face and give customers privacy, the CDC said.

An estimated 1.1 million Americans are infected with HIV, but as many as 20 percent of them don't know they carry the virus, according to the CDC. It can take a decade or more for an infection to cause symptoms and illness.

Since 2006, the CDC has recommended that all Americans ages 13 to 64 get tested at least once, not just those considered at highest risk: gay men and intravenous drug users. But fewer than half of adults younger than 65 have been tested, according to the agency's most recent statistics.

An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence, but medications now allow one to live a longer and healthier life.

This week, Walgreens, the nation's largest chain of pharmacies, is teaming with health departments and AIDS groups to offer free tests in 20 cities.

In that program, health professionals conduct the tests and deliver the news. The CDC program aims to train pharmacy staff on how to do the testing and deliver the results themselves, and perhaps make it a permanent service.

At Sarah Freedman's Walgreens in Washington, which is participating in the pilot program, prominent signs advertise the test, which is then done in a private room. The pharmacy has taken steps to let a customer discreetly request the test, with test request cards that look like business cards at George Washington University and nearby businesses. Anyone seeking a test can simply hand the card to the clerk, she said. So far, three or four customers have requested tests in the first few weeks.",26/06/2012

NewsDay,McFeatters: Radical Islam's war on health,"At the start of the new millennium, the United Nations' health organizations, WHO and UNICEF, were reasonably confident that polio could be eradicated by the end of 2004.

Then came radical Islam, with its suspicions about -- if not downright hatred of -- the United States. Muslim leaders in northern Nigeria announced that they were blocking UN immunizations of children because, they believed, the vaccines were laced with HIV and sterilization chemicals: It was all part of a sinister U.S. plot to reduce the Muslim population.

Whether the villagers believed this nonsense or not was immaterial because the Islamic radicals were prepared to stop the immunizations by force.

The disease spread to southern Nigeria and seven neighboring West African nations, and it has been a slow process to recoup the lost ground.

Now a Pakistani Taliban commander in North Waziristan has banned a polio-inoculation program just days before 161,000 children under age 5 were to be vaccinated. If this ban stands, it is a heartbreaking setback in the drive to eliminate the disease.

The commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, said he would allow the program to go forward if the United States stops all drone strikes. In a way, holding the children hostage to this crippling disease is a backhanded compliment: It suggests that the United States is too humane to allow this to happen and that we care more about Pakistan's children than Taliban leaders do.

According to The New York Times, Pakistan accounted for 198 new cases of polio last year, the highest rate in the world. The disease is now endemic in just three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

The sad thing about this mujahedeen meddling is that health workers were beginning to make real progress, 22 new cases reported in Pakistan so far this year compared with 52 this time last year.

It would speak very poorly of Pakistan if its government stood by while this crippling but easily preventable disease spread through the children of its northern tribes.

NewsDay,Study: New Yorkers' life expectancy longest,"A new study shows New Yorkers on average are living longer than the rest of the nation and experts cited in the study are crediting Mayor Michael Bloomberg's health initiatives during the last decade as a leading factor.

A report in the British medical journal, ""The Lancet,"" published June 2, found that the city's average life expectancy rose by eight years to 80.6 years between 1987 and 2009. The national average only rose during the same period 1.7 years to an expectancy of roughly 78 years, according to the journal.

While the mayor has been in office only since 2002, the experts involved in the report cited the Department of Health's programs since then to fight obesity and other health problems as helping New Yorkers live longer.

""They raised awareness that health is not only your job personally,"" Ali Mokdad, a health expert who led research for ""The Lancet,"" wrote.

""The Lancet"" specifically cited the city's fight against homicides and HIV/AIDS as factors why life expectancy grew at the beginning of the study period.

All five boroughs saw an increase in life expectancy, though the Bronx was the only one below the national average.

Since 30 percent of Bronx residents live below the poverty line, they do not have access to quality health care, exercise facilities or healthy foods, the study concluded.

But the city's health department helps ""to make healthy choices easier for the residents of the South Bronx."" Among them were attracting fresh fruit and vegetable vendors, improving asthma management and providing information and services to reduce teen pregnancy.

The city's programs such as the restaurant calorie count initiative and phasing in skim milk in public schools have also helped, the report said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture took note of the city's initiative and also plans to remove whole milk from schools nationwide.

""It's remarkable how often cities have been essentially the laboratories in which people have uncovered major truths about health,"" urban theorist Ed Glaeser said in the report.",18/06/2012

NewsDay,Catholic hospitals reject birth control compromise,"WASHINGTON - Sharpening an election-year confrontation over religious freedom and government health insurance rules, the nation's Catholic hospitals on Friday rejected President Barack Obama's compromise for providing birth control coverage to their women employees.

The Catholic Health Association was a key ally in Obama's health care overhaul, defying opposition from church bishops to help the president win approval in Congress. But the group said Friday it does not believe church-affiliated employers should have to provide birth control as a free preventive service, as the law now requires.

The hospital group's decision calls into question a compromise offered by the president himself only months ago, under which the cost of providing birth control would be covered by insurance companies and not religious employers. While churches and other places of worship are exempt from the birth control mandate, nonprofits affiliated with a religion, such as hospitals, are not.

In a letter to the federal Health and Human Services department, the hospital group said the compromise initially seemed to be ""a good first step"" but that examination of the details proved disappointing. The plan would be ""unduly cumbersome"" to carry out and ""unlikely to adequately meet the religious liberty concerns"" of all its members, the group said.

While some liberal-leaning religious groups see no problem with the birth control rule, Roman Catholic bishops and conservative-leaning groups are treating it as an affront and calling it an attack on religious freedom. Institutions ranging from the University of Notre Dame to Catholic Charities in several states to the Archdiocese of Washington have sued to block the rule.

With the Catholic Health Association now voicing concerns, opponents gained a powerful endorsement. There was no immediate reaction from the Obama administration.

The association represents about 600 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and other health-related organizations, totaling 2,000 members around the country. One of every six patients is cared for in a Catholic hospital.

In its letter, the group said the government should either broaden the exemption for religious employers, or pay directly for the birth control coverage.

Starting next Jan, 1, in most cases, women will have access to birth control at no additional charge through their job-based coverage, as part of a package of preventive services that also includes HIV screening and support for breast-feeding mothers. Some employers, considered to be ""grandfathered"" in under the health care law, will not have to provide the coverage.

The requirement applies to all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That includes the pill, intrauterine devices, the so-called morning-after pill, and newer forms of long-acting implantable hormonal contraceptives that are becoming widely used in the rest of the industrialized world.

The morning-after pill is particularly controversial. It has no effect if a woman is already pregnant, but many religious conservatives consider it tantamount to an abortion drug.

As recently as the 1990s, many health insurance plans didn't cover birth control. Protests, court cases, and new state laws led to dramatic changes. Today, almost all plans cover prescription contraceptives — but usually impose copays.

The White House has struggled to find a solution that will satisfy women's rights advocates without offending people who object on grounds of religious freedom. While Catholic church teaching has long opposed artificial means of birth control, polls show the faithful use the pill nonetheless.

Obama in 2008 won the total Catholic vote, 54 percent to Sen. John McCain's 45 percent, but he lost the white Catholic vote, 52 percent to 47 percent, according to exit polls. Once reliably Democratic, Catholics are now swing voters, with white Catholics making up the majority of the group.",15/06/2012
NewsDay,Waldorf-Astoria begins beekeeping,"An iconic hotel in the heart of midtown Manhattan is buzzing with thousands of tiny new visitors. But watch out: They'll sting if you get too close.

Honeybees have taken up residence at the Waldorf-Astoria New York, one of New York City's most famous institutions and a favorite stopover for many U.S. presidents. The hotel plans to harvest its own honey and help pollinate plants in the skyscraper-heavy heart of the city, joining a mini beekeeping boom that has taken over hotel rooftops from Paris to Times Square.

""Today about half the population of each hive, the foragers, are flying mostly in the direction of Central Park,"" explained Andrew Cote, the Waldorf's beekeeper-in-residence, on a recent sunny afternoon as he inspected each hive.

Beekeeping is a natural fit for hotels trying to keep up with industrywide pressure to ""go green,"" whether it's retrofitting their buildings to make them energy efficient or simply adopting environmentally conscious practices. Enter urban beekeeping, a buzz-worthy pastime nowadays in light of the mysterious disappearance of honeybees in recent years, which led some state agriculture departments to encourage hobby beekeeping.

About one-third of the nation's diet benefits from honeybee pollination, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In New York City, the bees will help pollinate new trees that have taken root as part of the city's plan to plant 1 million trees over the next decade.

At the Waldorf, the insects are visible from certain rooms, and guests can sign up for tours of the hives -- although they may want to put on a bee suit first.

Cote is something of a celebrity in the beekeeping world, having waged a successful campaign against the city's ban on keeping bees, which was lifted in 2010. He sells jars of honey at green markets throughout the city, tends hundreds of hives from Connecticut to Manhattan and founded the nonprofit Bees Without Borders and the New York City Beekeepers Association.

In keeping with the Waldorf's posh reputation, the bees arrived in a luxury car in April and were escorted through the lobby to their new home on the 20th floor roof deck. There are six hives in total; the most mature one already has 20,000 bees and counting.

""I don't know how many times I was stung today, but I probably deserved each and every one and more,"" Cote joked as he carefully lifted a bee-encrusted honeycomb out of a hive.

On the Waldorf's roof, he was checking the hives for a healthy queen and for any signs of disease or swarm intentions. After lifting the wooden cover from each hive, Cote immediately doused it with smoke.

""The smoke makes the bees a bit more docile,"" he said. ""It calms them a bit. It also distracts them.""

There should be plenty of honey to go around. If all goes well, there could be as many as 300,000 bees camping out at the Waldorf this summer.

Cote couldn't resist sampling some of the honey before finishing up his hive inspections. The prognosis?

NewsDay,Barnes-Dacey: Unrest at Assad's doorstep,"DAMASCUS, Syria - The eyes of the world are on Syria's outlying towns and villages, where the rebels are organizing and where the bodies are piling up. As the U.N. Security Council prepares to meet to discuss the crisis, U.N. monitors are rushing to the town of Mazraat al-Qubeir to investigate claims that at least 78 civilians were killed in cold blood by President Bashar Assad's militiamen. If true, the attack would be a grim echo to the gruesome massacre in the town of Houla last month.

But as Syria's periphery descends into chaos, observers may be missing a more subtle deterioration of Assad's authority at the center of his regime. The Syrian capital of Damascus, whose commercial center has been seen as immune from the nationwide unrest, is increasingly turning on the Assad regime - and widening unrest in the heart of the city now appears to be only a matter of time.

An important moment came last week, when security forces opened fire in the center of Damascus to disperse a small gathering of peaceful demonstrators at the end of Hamra Street, located just a few hundred meters away from parliament. Within minutes of the demonstrators gathering, security forces rushed onto the scene, firing into the air to scatter the protesters. The crackdown was notable because it marked an escalation of force by Syrian security services, which had hitherto largely restricted themselves to using batons against demonstrators within the heart of the city.

For 15 months, central Damascus has appeared a bastion of regime support in a sea of unrest. The lack of meaningful protests and violence, the busy cafes and bustling restaurants, and the sight of people apparently continuing their daily lives unaffected by the turmoil have played into the regime's narrative of enduring stability. In contrast to the capital's impoverished suburbs - home to those most affected by state corruption, brutality and mismanaged economic liberalization - those living in the center profited from the last decade of Assad's rule, and did not turn on the regime in great numbers. This section of the population has been emblematic of the so-called ""silent majority"" - the middle class that has seemingly sided with the regime out of a desire to maintain its privileged economic position and also out of fear of the violence and chaos that could follow the fall of Assad.

However, according to conversations with old acquaintances, businessmen, shopkeepers, middle-class professionals and taxi drivers in the capital, the mood has markedly shifted away from the regime over the last couple of months. ""Don't be fooled by the cafes and restaurants,"" an old friend, a businessman who once enthusiastically poured forth about the new possibilities opened up in the country under Assad, told me. He spoke of a city deeply on edge and increasingly hostile to the regime.

Another well-off, middle-class man launched into a tirade over the regime's incompetence and its willingness to push the country to civil war for the sake of preserving power. Syrians with the means to do so - even including many who had previously made commitments to seeing the conflict through from within the country - are now making plans to leave, and an exodus of middle-class professionals is expected come the end of the school year.

This hollowing-out of regime support in the capital, which is increasingly visible to visitors and residents alike, suggests the potential dawn of a new phase in Syria's long struggle. The decision by Damascene merchants to go on an unprecedented strike over recent days - locking their stores shut or sitting outside and refusing to do business in response to the Houla killings - marked an important escalation of local defiance. Previous calls for strikes, by contrast, had withered out unsuccessfully.

To be sure, many continue to back the regime within the capital, particularly some minorities who fear, as one Alawite told me, being driven out of Damascus. To many in this group, there is a clear solution to Syria's crisis: The Assad regime should be striking back with even more force to overcome foreign-backed ""terrorists."" But cracks in the support of former regime stalwarts are increasingly evident. Even one member of the parliamentary opposition - dismissed by most of Syria's revolutionaries as regime stooges - told me that ""the regime is crumbling"" and that change is now inevitable. ""We want to keep the state but get rid of the regime,"" the parliamentarian said.

Foreign observers also think the Assad regime is on its way to collapse. ""Everyone here, even the street cleaners, accept that Bashar can no longer be the driving force of the country,"" one diplomat in Damascus told me. ""The regime is finished."" The changing dynamic has not only been sparked by increased support for the opposition - indeed, many Damascenes struggle to identify their vision for Syria's future - but by a sense that the regime is no longer able to fulfill its most basic pledges of ensuring security and stability within the confines of the capital. Criminality is on the rise: Bodies are turning up in city morgues, and kidnappings, rape and petty crime are all appearing in a city that has long been one of the safest capitals in the Middle East. Meanwhile, there has been a noticeable escalation in the clashes between Assad's security forces and Free Syrian Army fighters across Damascus' suburbs, many areas of which fall under effective rebel control at night.

Anti-regime protests are also fast approaching the very heart of power. Whereas they were once confined to the farthest suburbs of the capital - the likes of Harasta and Douma - they are spreading to districts like Midan and Kafr Sousa, just minutes from downtown Damascus. One Western diplomat who continues to live in the city center told me that the nightly mortar attacks and gunfire from the suburbs had increased noticeably in intensity over previous weeks.

Some Syrians cite the May 10 attack, where car bombs exploded outside an intelligence building during the morning rush hour, killing at least 55 people, as a turning point, highlighting the threat of violence that regime tactics were bringing upon their heads. ""We suddenly panicked,"" one middle-aged Syrian told me. ""Our children were out, and we knew it could be them 1/8killed in the attack 3/8."" International sanctions are also beginning to bite, pushing up prices and creating new shortages and hardships for ordinary Syrians. Passing through the eastern gate of Bab Sharqi, a Christian quarter one afternoon, I came across a line of people several hundred meters long queuing for cooking gas. Tensions were clearly fraying at the front, with people shouting and elbowing their way to the front to demand first access to a truck that plainly didn't have enough supplies for the entire crowd.

Elsewhere, those businesses that haven't closed are suffering unprecedented economic pain: The lobby and restaurants of the Four Seasons hotel, once a hive of business activity, now lie eerily empty - a lone pianist providing the soundtrack for a city at the end of its rope.

As shown by its use of live fire on Hamra Street, the regime appears to be growing ever more forceful in pushing back, seeking to fall back on its still substantial military advantage to quash the threat. The day after the violent dispersal of the protest, pickup trucks openly loaded with mortars were shown on Syrian TV driving through the restive district of Midan - a clear warning to the local population. During my visit, security measures for entry into the heart of the city tightened - including increased barricades and new road closures - as did precautions outside the homes of key regime figures. These could well be signs of a regime on its back foot.

It is near impossible to truly gauge the balance of power in Damascus and Syria at large today. But the capital gives off the impression of a city on the brink. For many this brings a sense of deep foreboding. The emergence of widespread unrest in Damascus could prove fatal to the regime's lingering pretensions to legitimacy and control, likely provoking a brutal and bloody response. As one man, speaking with a sense of deep trepidation, told me: ""We know that it will come our way in the end, of course.""

NewsDay,Pallative care comforts aging population,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Fighting stage-four ovarian cancer, Carol Delzatto has more doctor appointments than she cares to count. But this day, she is beaming as Dr. Pamela Sutton comes into sight, greeting her patient and calling her beautiful. Delzatto looks forward to her monthly meeting with the palliative care doctor, where she won't be pricked and won't be rushed, just listened to and offered help.

Hospitals across the country have been adding programs in palliative care — which focuses on treating pain, minimizing side effects, coordinating care among doctors and ensuring the concerns of patients and their families are addressed — at a feverish pace. The field has expanded so rapidly that a majority of American hospitals now have palliative programs, to the delight of patients who say they've finally found relief and a sympathetic ear.

Palliative care has its roots in the 1970s, but was slow to grow. Several pieces of research helped to advance the cause, though, showing widespread untreated pain in hospitals and nursing homes and the positive impact palliative programs had on such patients.

""She's not writing. She is just looking at me and listening and feeling,"" said Delzatto, 67, during her visit to Broward General Medical Center, where Sutton helped start the palliative care program more than a decade ago.

Dr. Diane Meier of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, who directs the Center to Advance Palliative Care, says one of the discipline's greatest benefits is that it looks at the patient as a whole.

""Patients see a different person for every single part of their body or every problem. The patient as a whole person gets lost,"" said Meier, who won a MacArthur fellowship for her palliative work. ""The patient is a person, not a problem list, not a list of different organ systems with different problems, not a list of different diseases. So we end up serving in a quarterback role for the entire medical system.""

In 2000, there were 658 palliative programs in hospitals, according to the Center to Advance Palliative Care, representing about one-quarter of American hospitals. By 2009, about 63 percent of hospitals had palliative teams, with a total of 1,568 programs recorded. The field is expected to continue growing as awareness and acceptance spreads, just in time to help baby boomers — the 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 — as they move toward old age and begin developing more serious and life-threatening illnesses.

Though the programs and their scope vary widely, a common scenario might look like this: A patient is diagnosed with lung cancer, and a palliative care team's assistance is enlisted from the start, working alongside oncologists and other specialists. The palliative team may include doctors and nurses as well as a social worker and chaplain. Together, they coordinate care among the many medical professionals, have long consults with the patients and their families to answer questions, and may preventively prescribe medications for likely side effects of treatment, from pain to constipation to nausea.

The palliative team has a clear vision of the patients' goals and personal philosophies and, depending on these factors, might help steer them away from treatments that are determined to be more painful than they're worth. Though palliative doctors share some similarities with hospice doctors in this regard, their goal is still to cure, and their patients are not considered to be at the end of their lives, they are simply facing a serious illness.

Besides cancer, their help is commonly employed for treatment of heart and liver failure, HIV and AIDS, emphysema, sickle cell anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a wide variety of other illnesses.

Palliative teams are sometimes met with doubt by both patients and their medical colleagues. Dr. Timothy Quill, a palliative care doctor at the University of Rochester Medical Center and president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, concedes that patient recognition of what palliative care is remains relatively low and that resistance to the field remains among doctors untrained in the field.

Aside from misconceptions about palliative care being non-curative pain relief for patients destined to die, specialists may find a palliative team helps a patient reach a treatment decision that doesn't offer the most payment. Quill offers an example of a heart failure patient who may be considering getting a ventricular assist device.

""The economic incentives clearly favor doing aggressive medical interventions like this,"" Quill said. ""Palliative care, it's all conversation. And conversation is not compensated in the same way that doing procedures is in our system right now.""

Meier says resistance to palliative care tends to be generational, with many younger doctors embracing the field. Research on the subject has also helped prove its worth, particularly a 2010 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

That widely publicized report looked at terminal lung cancer patients and found patients who received palliative care as soon as they were diagnosed were in less pain, happier and more mobile than those who didn't receive such care, and the patients ultimately lived nearly three months longer.

Even with such scientific backing, and generally rave reviews from patients, even palliative care's most ardent backers admit it would not have spread as it has without showing cost savings to hospitals. Because a result of palliative care is shorter hospital stays, it can cut costs since many insurance plans pay a flat reimbursement for a treatment, not for the length of stay.

If a bed is freed up sooner, that means another paying customer can occupy it.

""By itself, better outcomes for patients would not be enough,"" Meier said. ""In our society and current way of life, it is impossible to introduce any innovation whether it's surgery or drugs or any innovation if you can't show that it doesn't increase costs.""

Broward General's adult and pediatric palliative teams saw more than 1,300 patients last year, but so far administrators have had trouble quantifying what the precise financial impact has been. Sutton and her colleagues have little doubt their work has resulted in fewer hospitalizations and shorter stays, but have found it hard to pinpoint the savings.

Sutton is focused this day on Delzatto, asking her about her sleep and bathroom patterns, and addressing her pain by writing prescriptions. Before seeing Sutton, the patient said she was suffering so greatly she was barely able to move. Now, she's able again to live fairly normally, browsing garage sales with a neighbor and walking the mall with her husband.

""The oncologists are focusing on chemo, the patients are focusing on cure and I think the conversations about comfort aren't happening,"" Sutton said.

Much of the appointment, Sutton just sits and listens, to Delzatto talking about her Mother's Day celebration, her new Kindle Fire and how she hopes to be able to go on a cruise later this year. And she hears Delzatto credit her with making her life livable again.

Risk is the parent of ruin and reward. Laura Burhenn understands this better than most, and indeed, saddled her excellent 2010 debut with the weighty ""What We Lost in the Fire, We Gained in the Flood."" Where that record was a rendering of life's chanciness draped in warm pop-soul tones from the depths of the '70s, Burhenn has decided to risk her easy goodwill by turning her sophomore album into a siege weapon against the status quo. Politics and pop don't usually rest easy, but what has Burhenn on the barricades, namely the asymmetries of America's ledgers, both moral and financial, is something most folks can get behind, and she finds ways to make the musical marriage work. The album begins with its direst tidings of wolves at the door and debts come due, all soaked in dark, insistent electronic tones. Especially so with the crunching, minor-key cacophony of the title track, a call to war that's hard to ignore. Burhenn isn't without subtlety, settling in at the end to deliver the battlefield poppy of ""Greatest Revenge,"" a gently damning piano and string number with a devastating breakdown that makes her lament crystal clear.

It's been half a decade since the Hives churned out a new album, but the scarily-committed Swedes haven't kicked their addiction to ""Raw Power."" Their take on stripped-down and amped-up Iggy Pop-style garage punk propelled them to international renown during the heady days of the early 2000s, when a definite article and a restrictive color scheme were prerequisites to success (see: The White Stripes, The Strokes, et al.), and they've burned like a long fuse since then. With such a hiatus, it could be forgiven for thinking the black and white-clad clan had fizzled, but their fifth full-length is as bombastic and blistering as one could reasonably expect from a band this deep into its discography. From early single ""Go Right Ahead,"" which recycles ELO's ""Don't Let Me Down"" into a furious anthem destined for an extreme sports video game franchise near you, to the Blackhearts groove of ""I Want More,"" the Hives' seem more comfortable than ever in acknowledging their DNA and embracing their rank as the cartoon princes of pure rock energy. These songs aren't designed to last beyond the brief seconds they blaze through the speakers, but it's a ripping good time while they do.",04/06/2012
NewsDay,"Duane, Manhattan senator, will not seek re-election","At City Hall, in his days before the Senate, Thomas Duane was well known in the City Council as a leading gay activist. Christine Quinn, now speaker of that body and 2013 mayoral candidate, is still a political ally. Now that Duane is retiring from the state Senate after 14 years, he could be expected to play a role in the Quinn mayoral effort in some capacity. He could even run for his old Council seat if he chose. The Senate district is expected to remain Democratic given its demographic. Assemb. Deborah Glick and others are mentioned as possible successors. Here's his announcement:

The announcement I am about to make is not an easy one for me, but after a lot of careful thought and deliberation I have made the decision not to run for an eighth term in the New York State Senate.

I was first elected to the State Senate in 1998 and I’ve worked hard to represent all the people of my Manhattan district for the past 14 years. But 14 years is a long time in Albany, and I have decided it is time for a new chapter in my life.

When I first was elected to the Senate, people told me it was a foolish career choice. I was told that an openly gay, openly HIV-positive man would accomplish little in a highly partisan and conservative State Senate. I was not discouraged by this talk; I took it as a challenge and was energized by it. And 14 years later we proved the naysayers wrong. The track record speaks for itself and every success was done in a bipartisan fashion.

The Marriage Equality Act, the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA), the Dignity for All Students Act, comprehensive hate-crime legislation and the Family Health Care Decisions Act are all major accomplishments that I am proud to have had a major role in, and I am grateful for all the help I had—from so many advocates, activists and other elected officials – in getting these laws passed. However, my greatest satisfaction comes not from those big ticket items but rather from bills, like my Sex Trafficking Victims Second Chance Act, which never grabbed headlines but changed the lives of some of New York’s most vulnerable residents for the better. It has always been my mission to help those who never before had a voice in the halls of government. My office has been a place where people no one would listen to could go for help. That is the reason I entered public service and I have never lost sight of that fact.

I am proud of the work I have been able to do at the State Capitol in Albany for the last 14 years. But New York City, not Albany, is my home and it is where the next chapter of my life will begin. That chapter will not be written, however, until my term ends on December 31st of this year. There is still much work to be done and I feel it is my obligation to remain firmly focused on the present.

The fight never ends. And on January 1st, while I may no longer be a Senator, I will continue to be an activist and an advocate. I will hold those positions for life.",04/06/2012
NewsDay,Injecting safety into shots,"The last thing you want is to leave the doctor's office or hospital sicker than when you went in. But for some, that is what happened because of unsafe injection practices.

The One and Only Campaign, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Safe Injection Practices Coalition, is focused on raising awareness among patients and health care providers about proper injection procedures. For example, it's not enough to use a new needle for each patient. New syringes should also be used.

Since 1999, more than 125,000 people have been informed they may have been exposed to hepatitis or HIV because of injection lapses by health care professionals.

NewsDay,No needle exchange program for Freeport,"A nonprofit that serves HIV-positive Long Islanders has identified Freeport as a community in ""high"" need of a needle exchange program, but the group has decided to stay out of the village because of community opposition.

The Lindenhurst-based Long Island Minority AIDS Coalition had been considering placing a van at the corner of North Main Street and Brooklyn Avenue to allow drug users to swap used intravenous needles for clean ones.

The service would have helped stop the spread of HIV by disposing of used needles, and also would have provided referrals to drug treatment programs and other services, said Tina Wolf, the coalition's syringe exchange director.

But a group of residents found out about the coalition's plan earlier this month. They complained to the group and to village officials that the van would attract criminals to the area. Village officials also said they weren't adequately consulted about the coalition's plan to come to Freeport.

""You have to expect that drug dealers are going to come because they've got their customers and they've got their needles,"" said Pat Rowen, one of the residents who opposed the van.

Wolf said the coalition, which runs a similar van program in Hempstead Village, targeted Freeport because it is an area ""where we can have the most impact.""

The state health department's Community Need Index, which uses factors such as AIDS cases, drug use statistics and teen pregnancy rates to determine a community's need for HIV and AIDS services, listed Freeport's ZIP code as one of the five neediest in Nassau County, records show.

But the coalition has decided to stay out of Freeport because of the community's opposition to the program, said Rabia Aziz, the group's executive director.

""We will not go into any community that is not supportive of the service, nor should we,"" Aziz said.

Before the coalition's decision, village officials had questioned whether the coalition could set up the van without a permit.

The van would have been located in a high-traffic area near the Freeport Long Island Rail Road station and could have needed an assembly permit, village attorney Howard Colton said.

Freeport Mayor Andrew Hardwick said the coalition never came to him about such a permit.

""I took it as a blatant sign of disrespect that they would set up shop in a municipality without contacting the chief executive first,"" Hardwick said.

Wolf said the coalition does not always need local approval to set up a van program.

Some residents, including Anthony Miller, said they could see the benefit of the needle exchange program, but added that the coalition should have talked to village officials and residents first.

""I don't have a problem with them bringing something like that into the community, but they should bring it here before the board first,"" Miller said after a recent board of trustees meeting.",28/05/2012
NewsDay,Baldwin doctor John Clarke raps against disease,"Hundreds of sixth graders at Garden City Middle School agreed with Dr. John Clarke’s premise -- rap music can be a great way to reach a young mind.

They nodded their heads and clapped their hands on Thursday morning as Clarke performed his original song “Melanoma Rap,” part of the Sun Safety Presentation:

Stop melanoma

Please don’t forget

Use sunscreen

Do a skin check

Clarke, 40, medical director for the Long Island Rail Road, is the creator of HealthHop, a music genre that educates people through hip hop.

""It's a lot of fun to rap for me,"" said Clarke, who lives in Baldwin. ""It's always interesting because kids assume a doctor rapping is corny, and they are shocked by me doing hip hop. The kids always have a great time while they are learning from my music.""

The Baldwin resident received his B.A. in sociology and music from Columbia University and his medical degree from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan.

Clarke, who has rapped about HIV, drug and alcohol prevention, sickle cell, psoriasis and the H1N1 flu, came up with the idea for educating kids through rap during his first year as a resident in training at Jamaica Hospital in Queens in 1997. Since then the reactions from the kids have kept him going.

“Last year, I performed at Garden City Middle School,” remembered Clarke. I went back to the school the next day and one kid gave me a high five and said I was awesome.”

Kelly O’Keeffe, 12, said the morning assembly was one she will not soon forget.

“It’s better to rap about melanoma than just stand there and talk about it. I liked the rap song a lot,” she said.

The program also featured Garden City-based dermatologist Dr. Theodore Daly and Garden City’s Jack Biggane, whose daughter Mollie Biggane died from melanoma at the age of 20. The Mollie Biggane Melanoma Foundation was later created in her memory.

Student Antonella D’Amelio, 11, said she will take Thursday’s lessons to heart.

“I am going to take his [Clarke’s] advice and protect myself from the sun. I will definitely put on sunscreen,” she said.

NewsDay,Over-the-counter HIV test awaits approval,"WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration is considering approval of the first over-the-counter HIV test that would allow consumers to quickly check themselves for the virus, without medical supervision.

The OraQuick In-Home HIV test could play a significant role in slowing the spread of HIV, according to briefing documents posted online. But FDA reviewers on Friday also raised concerns about the accuracy of the test, a mouth swab that returns results in about 20 minutes.

The review came one day after an FDA advisory panel endorsed the HIV pill Truvada for preventive use. If the FDA follows the panel's advice, the daily medication would become the first drug approved to prevent healthy people from becoming infected with the virus that causes AIDS.

Public health experts estimate one-fifth, or about 240,000 people, of the 1.2 million HIV carriers in the country are not aware they are infected. Testing is one of the chief means of slowing new infections, which have held steady at about 50,000 per year for two decades.

In a trial conducted by the company OraSure Technologies Inc., the test correctly detected HIV in those carrying the virus 93 percent of the time. That rate is below the FDA-recommended 95 percent threshold. The FDA estimates the test would miss about 3,800 HIV-positive people per year, if approved.

The test was more accurate at correctly clearing patients who do not have the disease. In company studies, OraQuick correctly identified HIV-negative users 99 percent of the time.

On Tuesday, the FDA will ask a panel of outside experts whether the test should be approved for over-the-counter sales. The agency is not required to follow the group's advice, though it usually does.",12/05/2012
NewsDay,Kidsday: Why I like being a beekeeper,"I like bees. I like them a lot. Because I like them so much, I have decided to become a beekeeper. My family takes care of about a half million honeybees. I wake up very early before school to feed them sugar, water and flattened beetles.

You have to protect yourself from stings by wearing a big suit that is connected to pants. Once you put the suit on, you have to pull up your socks so that the honeybees don't go in your boots to sting you. You also have to put a hat over the hood net that goes over your face. When you wear a bee suit, it feels like you are a robot, but I've been a beekeeper for about four years, so I'm used to it.

In one box, there are nine trays of frames. The bees think that these plastic trays are real hives, so they build combs on them. You need to use a special smoking gun that calms the bees so that they don't swarm. It takes thousands and thousands of bees to make a jar of honey.

Bees can stay outside when it's warm. You should look to see if the bees are making honey and check if the queen bee is still there. The queen makes sure the worker bees do their jobs.

In the winter, I have a special metal cover, and it keeps the snow from leaking through the wood bee case. Bees wings get stuck together if it is under 50 degrees. It has to be above 70 degrees for bees to fly. Bees have to always fly straight because if they lose their balance, they will fall.

Warning! Never stand in front of a hive.

My fascination began about four years ago when I visited my aunt in Orient. Her friend was a beekeeper. My parents liked my interest, and they helped me by getting me the smoking gun, bee outfit and bee boxes. Then, I started collecting bees. It didn't work. After a while, the bees I collected either took off or died. I needed a queen bee. Another family friend in Mattituck gave me a more detailed explanation on beekeeping.

This year, I am getting a queen bee and will start my business. I keep my bee box in the backyard, away from everyone.

NewsDay,FDA panel says: OK drug to prevent HIV,"SILVER SPRING, Md. -- The first drug shown to prevent HIV infection won the endorsement of a panel of federal advisers yesterday, clearing the way for a landmark approval in the 30-year fight against the virus that causes AIDS.

In a series of votes, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended approval of the daily pill Truvada for healthy people who are at high risk of contracting HIV, including gay and bisexual men and heterosexual couples with one HIV-positive partner.

The FDA is not required to follow the panel's advice, though it usually does. A final decision is expected by June 15.

Gilead Sciences Inc., based in Foster City, Calif., has marketed Truvada since 2004 as a treatment for people who are infected with the virus. The medication is a combination of two older HIV drugs, Emtriva and Viread. Doctors usually prescribe it as part of a drug cocktail to suppress the virus. -- AP",10/05/2012
NewsDay,Mixed success in eradicating AIDS,"UNITED NATIONS -- UN officials report mixed success in the global effort by governments and health care providers to eradicate AIDS, saying that antiretroviral drug therapies are working, access to treatment is increasing and fewer people with the disease are dying -- though more people than ever are living with HIV.

""AIDS remains one of the great challenges of our times,"" stated the report released Monday by Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. ""More people than ever, an estimated 34 million as of December 2010, are living with HIV.""

The 25-page report states nations will not reach the goals set last year in the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly, to reduce the scourge of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome by 2015.

Those goals include reducing by 50 percent the number of new infections through sexual contact and intravenous drugs to 1 million and 120,000 a year, respectively. In the most recent figures available, for 2010, the number of new infections, 2.7 million, was 21 percent lower than in 1997, when infections peaked at 3.3 million.

""While new infections are on the decline in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, HIV incidence is rising in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in the Middle East and North Africa, and in certain Asian countries,"" the report said.

Still, sub-Saharan Africa remains troubling: It is home to 68 percent of all people living with HIV and 70 percent of all people newly infected in 2010.

""Although striking progress has been achieved, the world is not on track to meet the 2015 targets, underscoring the urgent need for all stakeholders to redouble their efforts to strengthen the HIV response,"" Ban's report stated.

Fewer people are dying of AIDS-related diseases, the report stated, and, in low- and middle-income countries, antiretroviral drug cocktails have prevented an estimated 2.5 million deaths since 1995. And the 1.8 million AIDS-related deaths reported in 2010 is 18 percent lower than it has been since the mid-2000s.

""HIV incidence is rising in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in the Middle East and North Africa, and in certain Asian countries,"" the report said.

The report recommends an aggressive approach to achieve the goals, which include reaching 15 million people living with HIV with antiretroviral treatment, eliminating new infections in children and substantially reducing AIDS-related maternal deaths, halving tuberculosis among those living with HIV and increasing research and treatment funding.

Indeed, it said that $22 billion to $24 billion will be needed by 2015 to reach the targets even as it reported a decline in funding in 2010, when $15 billion was appropriated worldwide.

""Efforts must be refocused to achieve real results and end a global epidemic of historic proportions,"" the report said. ""The response must be smarter and more strategic, streamlined, efficient and grounded in human rights.""",01/05/2012
NewsDay,Maragos urges state audit of AIDS group,"Nassau County Comptroller George Maragos, citing a lack of cooperation, has called off an 11-month audit of a not-for-profit AIDS group based in Suffolk and referred the issue to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.

The Long Island Association for AIDS Care, and its associated agencies, BiasHELP, a not-for-profit focused on prevention of bias crimes, and the Long Island Network of Community Services, which helps nonprofits with fundraising and other functions, are based in Hauppauge.

""We recommend that the State further review LIAAC's affiliated companies, LINCS, and BiasHELP, to ensure proper management and use of public funds,"" Maragos said in his letter to the agency.

""Contrary to the Comptroller's letter, LIAAC fully cooperated with the financial audit concerning HIV prevention services for 2009-2010,"" said Andrew Kraus, a spokesman for the agency. ""The LIAAC board of directors . . . are outraged that the Comptroller, yet again, has sent out a news release without notifying or asking to meet with the board.""

Last May, following media reports that LIAAC's chief executive, Gail Barouh, was earning more than $400,000 a year from multiple employers and after the county refused to renew any contracts with the agency, Maragos announced an audit of the business.

""The lack of transparency by LIAAC, a nonprofit organization, raised very disturbing questions as to how taxpayer money is being spent,"" Maragos said. ""Our discovery that the CEO of this nonprofit was earning over $432,000 in compensation from multiple employers caused further concern.""

The agency disputed the salary. A spokeswoman said Barouh made only about $270,000.

It couldn't be confirmed whether the attorney general and state comptroller's offices had received copies of Maragos' letter.",30/04/2012
NewsDay,Pall's sale of blood operation shifts focus,"Pall Corp.'s decision to sell some of its blood and transfusion assets, for $550 million, marks a shift in strategy for the Port Washington-based global filtration maker during its first year under a new chief executive, Larry Kingsley.

The Sunday announcement brings at least a partial end to a blood-filtering technology operation created by the company founder, the late David Pall, a quarter-century ago amid growing global alarm about the spread of HIV through transfusions.

Pall officials Monday declined an interview request. The company said in a statement that the sale, to Massachusetts-based Haemonetics Corp., is a good one because it sharpens the company's focus on areas of its business that are most likely to grow. Pall makes a wide range of filtration, separation and purification products.

Pall stock closed Monday at $59.61 a share, down 80 cents.

It was in 1988 that an industry analyst told Newsday he was very impressed with Pall Corp.'s new blood filter that ""separates white blood cells and the viruses that cause AIDS and hepatitis from blood plasma."" David Pall himself had invented the filters.

The technology was one of the final achievements by Pall, then in his mid-70s, who had first developed porous stainless steel while working on the U.S. nuclear bomb effort, the Manhattan Project, during World War II. After the war he founded his company in Glen Cove, commercializing the porous steel technology and eventually adding a range of high-performance filters made with other metals, glass fiber and plastic polymer.

In the early 1990s, shepherding the new blood-filtering enterprise to a global market soon became the responsibility of Abraham Krasnoff, Pall's longtime business partner, who had just been appointed chairman of the board. Krasnoff's son Eric later became the Pall Corp. chief executive.

Kingsley's appointment as president and chief executive in October 2011 marked the end of more than 60 years of Krasnoff family leadership at Pall Corp. By that time it had become one of Long Island's largest companies, with nearly $3 billion in annual revenue, and one of the world's purification and filtration giants.

Pall Corp.'s decision to sell off the blood assets will transfer 1,300 employees to Haemonetics when the sale closes this year. The company has about 500 employees on Long Island and 10,400 others worldwide.

In the transaction, Haemonetics will get blood collection, filtration and processing systems and equipment. It will also get manufacturing operations in California, Mexico, Italy and Puerto Rico.

Pall said it expects an after-tax gain of $230 million to $240 million from the sale.",30/04/2012
NewsDay,Call for ban on condom confiscation,"ALBANY -- Advocates for sex workers want New York to become the first state to ban police officers from confiscating condoms as evidence in prostitution cases, saying it has a chilling effect on disease protection.

To bolster their case, a group issued a report showing that fear of police harassment and arrest has prompted some prostitutes to carry fewer or no condoms and have sex without them, despite massive government giveaways.

""We did find, which is a good thing, that sex workers generally carry condoms and use condoms,"" said Sienna Baskin, an attorney with the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in Manhattan. But prostitutes also say police confiscate condoms as a kind of harassment, she said. In surveys, several sex workers said city police took their condoms without arresting them.

Calls to the New York Police Department and Manhattan district attorney's office were not immediately returned .

State Sen. Velmanette Montgomery, a Brooklyn Democrat and sponsor of the bill to ban condom evidence, said she has been told the bill would get on the calendar for committee consideration in the Republican-controlled Senate. She said a similar measure has previously passed the Democrat-controlled Assembly.

""We are not endorsing prostitution,"" Montgomery said. ""It is simply related to the fact that over 100,000 people right now are infected with HIV and AIDS in New York City.""

Alexandra Waldhorn, spokeswoman for the city health department, said Tuesday that the city opposes the pending legislation.

Kate Hogan, a prosecutor who is the former president of the state district attorneys' association, said the real goal of prostitution cases is ""to get the pimps and the sex traffickers."" Giving up supporting evidence would be giving them ""a lot of leeway we don't want to give them,"" she said.

In a bid to curb the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, New York City health officials began giving out free condoms in 1971 and say they have given out 192 million since 2007. In a similar program, the state health department said it distributes more than 10 million annually.",17/04/2012
NewsDay,Kenny: The failed war on drugs,"America's longest running war -- the one against drugs -- came in for abuse last weekend at the Summit of the Americas. The abuse is deserved. Forty years of increasingly violent efforts to stamp out the drug trade haven't worked. And the blood and treasure lost is on a scale with America's more conventional wars. On the upside, we know that an approach based around treating drugs as a public health issue reaps benefits to both users and the rest of us.

President Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala opened the rhetorical offensive against the drug war last week when he wrote that ""decades of big arrests and the seizure of tons of drugs"" have not stopped ""booming"" production and consumption. Molina argued that ""global drug policy today is based on a false premise: that the global drug markets can be eradicated."" Drug abuse, like alcoholism, should be treated as a public health problem, he suggested. We should consider a move towards drug regulation - including taxation and prohibition of sales to minors. As the summit discussion made clear, Molina's statement represents regionwide concern with the business-as-usual strategy toward drugs. Indeed, most of Latin America has already moved toward decriminalization of drug possession in small amounts, and some are considering legalization.

But it isn't just in Latin America that the winds of change are blowing when it comes to drugs policy. Last June, the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which included Kofi Annan, three former presidents from Latin America, a prime minister and former president from Europe, former Fed Chair Paul Volker and former Secretary of State George Shultz, concluded much the same thing as Molina. ""The global war on drugs has failed,"" they reported. It is high time to move toward experimentation with ""models of legal regulation."" As a domestic policy, a harsh enforcement approach has done little to control drug use, but has done a lot to lock up a growing portion of the U.S. population. Cocaine and opiate prices are about half their 1990 levels in America today. And 16 percent of American adults have tried cocaine - that's about four times higher than any other surveyed country in a list that includes Mexico, Colombia, Nigeria, France, and Germany. And while criminalization has a limited impact on price and use, it has a significant impact on crime rates. Forty percent of drug arrests in the United States are for the simple possession of marijuana. Nearly half a million people are behind bars in the United States for a drug offense - that's more than 10 times the figure in 1980.

As a result, the United States is spending about $40 billion per year on the war on drugs - with three-quarters of that expenditure on apprehending and punishing dealers and users. All of those police out there slapping cuffs on folks found with a baggie of Purple Kush aren't watching for drunk drivers or burglars. And drug enforcement is more closely linked with violent crime than drug use. Meanwhile, the cost of lost productivity from jailed citizens is around $39 billion per year. Such sums are considerably higher than the costs of ill-health associated with drug use, suggesting in strict economic terms at least that it isn't drugs - but drug control policy - that is the problem. Add in the social effects of mass incarceration (from rape to split families to unemployment to poverty) and the uncertain benefits of the war on drugs become dwarfed by the known costs.

Harsh enforcement hasn't failed as a policy only in the United States, of course. Across countries, analysis by World Bank economists Philip Keefer, Norman Loayaza, and Rodrigo Soares suggests that drug prosecution rates or the number of police in a country has no effect on drug prices.

Conversely, the Global Commission on Drug Policy report compiled evidence suggesting that approaches based on treatment rather than punishment were far more effective in reducing consumption, HIV prevalence, and crime rates among users. For example, Britain and Germany, both of which long ago adopted harm-reduction strategies for people injecting drugs - programs that include needle exchange programs and medication - see HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs below 5 percent. The United States and Portugal, by contrast, where such strategies were introduced later or only partially, see HIV prevalence among a similar community at above 15 percent.

Again, the global evidence that legalization would increase use is sparse. Use is far more connected with social, environmental, and economic contexts than legal status. Portugal decriminalized drug possession and use 10 years ago, and has seen drug use fluctuate at similar rates to countries where possession remains illegal according to the commission report. Similarly, U.S. states that have decriminalized cannabis possession have not seen greater increases in use than those states where it remained illegal.

But if the war on drugs is a failed domestic policy in the United States, it is also - particularly as the U.S. population is the world's largest consumer of illicit drugs - a failed global strategy. And a larger price for that failure is paid abroad. Drug crop eradication programs simply don't work to dry up global supply. They can drive up the local price of a crop - but that alone is likely only to force a move in production rather than overall reduction. Aggregate coca cultivation in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru was higher in 2007 than in the late 1990s, for example, despite stepped up eradication programs in all three countries. In turn, this might help explain why multiple, expensive eradication efforts from Colombia to Afghanistan have done little to increase drug prices in Western markets, which reached historic lows in the mid-2000s.

Connected to all this is the fact that farmers are not the ones making big money from the drug trade. The price of one kilo of cocaine at the point of production in Colombia in 2000 was about $650. By the time it reached Miami, that price had risen to $23,000, with a final retail price of closer to $120,000 - suggesting the point of production price is a little more than half a percentage point of the final price.

Given the low wholesale price, it's not surprising that experience from around the world suggests that given other crop options - flowers in Thailand, onions in Pakistan, potatoes in Laos - and the ability to get those crops to a functioning market, farmers will often abandon coca and poppy production for these more profitable sources of revenue. The war on drugs, by creating instability and weakening the operation of those markets, may have the perverse effect of increasing the attractiveness of drug crop production for farmers.

And while eradication doesn't work to reduce supply in rich countries, alongside interdiction efforts it can have catastrophic spillover effects in poor countries. Mexico is spending $9 billion a year to fight drug trafficking, for example, and yet the drug war killed 34,000 people between 2006 and 2010, according to the government. Some 27,000 Colombians died each year during the 1990s as a result of violence fueled by drug cartels. Analysis by Jennifer Holmes and colleagues at the University of Texas suggests that coca cultivation was not related to violence in Colombia between 1999 and 2001 - but eradication efforts were. Again, economists Oeindrila Dube and Suresh Naidu found that U.S. military aid to Colombia was associated with greater paramilitary violence: A 10 percent increase in U.S. military aid was associated with a 15 percent rise in paramilitary attacks in regions where there was a Colombian army base, compared to other regions.

In fact, thanks to the profitable, violent, criminal oligopolies that are the spinoff of the global war on drugs, developing countries that produce drugs or are on drug trade routes face a risk of descending into narco-kleptocracy. In 2010, the commander of Venezuela's armed forces, the president of Nicaragua, the prime minister of Kosovo, the son of the president of Guinea, and a host of politicians allied with the Burmese junta were all deeply involved in the drug trade, according to Moises Naim of the Carnegie Endowment.

Meanwhile, popular attitudes toward drug policy in the United States are finally shifting. For the first time since Gallup started asking the question, the majority of Americans think marijuana use should be legal. And the country already has what might be called a more nuanced approach to other addictive drugs. The U.S. government is happy to conclude trade agreements that actually encourage smoking around the world, for example. And the United States is willing to bear the domestic health costs of tobacco and alcohol use that kill 30 times as many people a year as do illegal drugs. Yes, policies toward cocaine or heroin should be far more constraining than those toward cigarettes or beer, but the rationale for such a completely different approach to one set of substances than the other is threadbare.

Nobody should underestimate the appalling toll of drug addiction - it ends many lives and ruins many more. Of the 250 million drug users worldwide, the United Nations estimates around 25 million are dependent. The question is, does the current approach toward drug policy work to reduce this toll? And what are the spillover effects of America and Europe's hard line on drugs to other countries? The evidence suggests the policy has failed and that the spillover effects are considerable.

The good news is that a different strategy could turn around the violence and lower the economic, social, and health costs of narcotics. America and Europe should commit to a drug policy based around public health and regulation - making drug use safer, legal, and rare - rather than criminalization and paramilitary enforcement. This switch will save money and families at home alongside lives and livelihoods abroad. It is time the world ended its addiction to war as a tool of social control.

NewsDay,Hudson Valley AIDS Walk to mark 20 years,"The Hudson Valley AIDS Walk will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. May 5 on the Walkway Over the Hudson.

Celebrating its 20th year, the event started in 1992 and was originally held in White Plains, moving to Poughkeepsie in 2004.

More than 6,200 Hudson Valley residents live with HIV/AIDS, according to the latest estimates.

Funds raised from the event will be used to support programs of the nonprofit ARCS, like food pantries, client emergency fund and HIV prevention programs.

Cynthia Wynkoop, a Rondout Valley teacher, feels the support the AIDS Walk brings to the community is important. ""Since funding continues to be an issue, it has never been more important to support our community and our neighbors. I am happy to do my part for the AIDS walk so that important support and programs can continue,"" she said in a release.

The May 5 event will feature music by Superior Sounds, a Zumba warm-up, free snacks, water from Stop and Shop, Starbucks coffee, a community health fair and a massage booth.

A party will be held at 1 p.m. at the Brown Derby, 96 Main St., where there will be a live performance by Jason Gisser.

NewsDay,Public health pioneer to lead World Bank,"WASHINGTON -- Jim Yong Kim, an American who is president of Dartmouth College, has been chosen to be the next president of the World Bank. His selection Monday extends the U.S. hold on the top job at the 187-nation development agency.

Kim, a surprise nominee of President Barack Obama, was selected in a vote by the World Bank's 25-member executive board. He'll succeed Robert Zoellick, who's stepping down after a five-year term.

Developing nations waged an unsuccessful challenge to Kim, 52, a physician and pioneer in treating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis in the developing world.

Kim's selection marks a break from previous World Bank leaders who were typically political, legal or economic figures.

The World Bank raises money from its member nations and borrows from investors to provide low-cost loans to developing countries.

Developing countries had put forward two candidates for the post -- Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and former Colombian Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo.

Both had argued that it was time to break the hold the United States has had on the World Bank job and provide a greater voice for developing nations.

Kim will begin a five-year term in July. Born in South Korea, Kim is an American who moved to the United States with his family at age 5. His selection extends the tradition of Americans leading the World Bank, dating to the institution's founding in 1944.

Kim was in Lima, Peru, on Monday -- the latest stop in a global tour that has taken him to Africa, Asia and Latin America to try to build support among developing countries.

He and the other candidates were interviewed by the World Bank's board last week. In his statement to the board, Kim said he had worked throughout his career for ""reform and change"" and would continue those efforts at the World Bank.

Obama's announcement March 23 that Kim would be the U.S. nominee for the World Bank post came as a surprise. His name had not been mentioned as a possible candidate.

Those more often mentioned included Larry Summers, who had led the White House economic council earlier in the Obama administration, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

But Kim's nomination had won widespread praise because of his extensive experience in working to improve health in the poorest countries. In the 1990s, Kim defied skeptics to find a cost-effective way to fight tuberculosis in the slums of South America. He also began a program that has treated millions of Africans for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Since 2009, Kim has been president of Dartmouth College.

The World Bank focuses on fighting poverty and promoting development. In recent decades, it's focused on poor nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is a leading source of development loans for financing to build dams, road and other projects.",16/04/2012
NewsDay,Sex and love over 50 is a brave new world,"After her

decades-long marriage ended in divorce two years ago, ""L"" started looking for a new man to share her life. For the first time in a long time, the 54-year-old Nassau resident decided to take a dip in the dating scene pool.

Initially, she was looking only for friendship and a little validation from the opposite sex that she was still desirable. ""It made me feel good to feel attractive, flirting with guys, even though I wasn't ready for anything more serious,"" says L, who requested anonymity to shield her grown children from the private details of her life.

Eventually, she wanted something more, beyond friendship. Her transition was eased by joining a divorce support group at the Mid-Island Y Jewish Community Center in Plainview, where she made new friends who helped her understand the changes in the dating scene since her marriage. ""That really gave me a lot of insight . . . and prepared me pretty much for what's out in the world nowadays,"" she says.

Registering with the online Jewish singles network, JDate, she began to meet men. ""It was very scary,"" says L, who was born and raised as a Conservative Jew in South America and immigrated to this country in the early 1980s.

Her first 20 JDate ""matches"" were mostly with men she wasn't interested in. Others were ""horror stories,"" like the man who showed up drunk at a restaurant and immediately began pawing and propositioning her.

She also was concerned about the ugly reality of sexually transmitted diseases (commonly referred to as STDs). When she was married, she says ""AIDS and STDs were a far-off thing."" But that sense of security evaporated when she learned that her husband had been unfaithful, leading her to be tested for HIV. Her results came back negative, but she started requiring the man she was having relations with to use condoms when they were intimate. She also did background checks on prospective mates, searching for information about them on the Internet.

For the past 11/2 years, she has been dating a man she met through JDate. They have a satisfying, intimate relationship, made more enjoyable by her new outlook on life as a woman in her 50s. ""Sex is great,"" she says candidly, ""but it's different because I'm not 20 anymore, I feel more confident in myself, and I'm more open with my sexuality.""

Dating is different now

For recently divorced or widowed baby boomers and even older adults who are suddenly single after a generation of married life, dating is a different animal from the one they knew years ago. The sexual revolution of the 1960s, the women's movement, medical advances with enhancement drugs such as Viagra, and an epidemic of STDs including HIV and AIDS that began in the 1980s, have all helped to create a challenging and sometimes intimidating era for older women and men who are suddenly single. However, with help from more experienced friends, and advice from experts, many start their dating lives over and find fulfillment with new partners.

There's an apparent appetite for the subject and a wide variety of offerings for different tastes -- from best-selling novels by E.L. James to discussions on Internet sites for the 50-and-older crowd, and events for those who want a road map to help navigate sexual relations and intimacy in their later years. For instance, L attended a recent lecture by an expert on 50-plus sex and intimacy at the Sid Jacobson Jewish Community Center in East Hills. About 50 women (men were welcome, but none attended) went to the event, sponsored by the Transition Network of Long Island, an organization for women who are 50 and older.

The speaker, Suzanne Braun Levine, is the author of ""How We Love Now: Sex and the New Intimacy in Second Adulthood"" (Viking). Levine offered a positive message to attendees about sexuality as they enter the ""second adulthood,"" which she describes as ages 50 to 75. There are ""a serious proportion of women our age who are having the best sex of their lives,"" she says. However, Levine acknowledges that some women 50 and older ""can't find partners or suffer a physiological condition that makes sex unpleasant."" Often, she says, the problem can be medically treated.

Sexuality, seniors and their search for love in the 21st century has become the subject of many blogs and websites. And while women seem more inclined to get together to talk about s-e-x, that doesn't mean guys don't have questions about the subject, too.

A man's 'road map'

Harold Spielman, 84, of Sands Point, recently launched SuddenlySolo.org, a website described as ""a lifestyle road map for the mature widowed or divorced man."" Categories of information include ""Sex & Relationships,"" ""Solo Living"" and ""Personal Experiences.""

Four years ago, Spielman's second wife died. When he was ready to begin dating again, he found support from a close friend and business associate. ""She introduced me to the fact that there was a lot of activity going on out there."" But even with a guide, he still finds some of the changes startling.

As a new single, Spielman says he began buying prophylactics for the first time since he was a young man. He was surprised to find what he wanted on display, readily accessible, instead of being discreetly stored behind a counter.

""When I was a teen,"" Spielman recalls, ""you were embarrassed if there was a saleswoman behind the counter and you wouldn't buy them [condoms]. Now they're out there hanging in the open, by the vibrators.""

Protection is important for sexually active older people who are not married or in a steady relationship, because of the prevalence of STDs, including HIV, Spielman says. HIV transmission is a problem among older people because many mature women don't insist on condom use because it's unlikely they'll get pregnant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on its website 1.usa.gov/cMxa6e, states that adults 50 and older accounted for 15 percent of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in 2005. Many older people ""do not use condoms and do not get tested for HIV,"" according to the CDC.

Despite the risks, some are finding joy in rediscovering sensuality with a more mature mindset. Bonnie Katz, who is in her 60s and lives in Bay Shore, recently reunited with an old flame. They were both students 45 years ago and planned to marry but ended up scrapping their wedding plans. ""We both went our separate ways in the late 1960s,"" she says.

Now divorced, Katz found her former beau's email address online and they began corresponding. Katz, a retired Smithtown teacher, and the love of her younger life, a retired attorney, have reunited, but Katz says their relationship is different this time.

As college sweethearts in the late 1960s, Katz says, ""you didn't talk about your feelings, everybody kept things in . . . so the first thing we said was that we were not going to do that anymore, that it was time to talk about feelings and be honest."" Their second time around is sensual but more honest than it was years ago, she says.

""If you are open with each other, then your sensuality with each other and your feelings are more open,"" Katz says. ""It becomes very loving and caring and . . . it's more about the whole relationship than just about the sex.""",14/04/2012
NewsDay,Free STD screenings available in April,"Planned Parenthood of Nassau County is offering free screenings for sexually transmitted diseases this month outside its clinics.

The organization is offering the screenings as part of the national Get Yourself Tested campaign, designed to encourage young people to talk to their health care providers and be screened for STDs.

Even though people between ages 15 and 24 years old represent only 25 percent of the sexually experienced population, they acquire nearly half of all new STDs, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Untreated, STDs can increase the risk of infertility and cancer and make one more likely to get HIV.

The screenings — for HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydia — will be offered at the following times at the blue Plan Van parked outside its three clinics. No appointment is necessary.

NewsDay,2 LIers arrested in prescription drug ring,"ALBANY -- Two Long Islanders were among four men arrested Wednesday who are accused of distributing illegally obtained and possibly unsafe medications to HIV patients as part of a $274-million black-market prescription drug ring.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the arrests of participants of what he called a ""massive"" prescription drug ring on Long Island and in Brooklyn.

With two Suffolk County pharmacists allegedly playing central roles, the scheme revolved around illegally obtaining at least $274 million in black-market medications, selling them to HIV and AIDS patients, and then billing New York State's Medicaid program for at least $155 million in otherwise unsaleable drugs. The pills given to patients may have included stolen and expired medications, Schneiderman said.

In the process, the suspects pocketed millions of dollars, according to Schneiderman.

Glenn Schabel, 51, of Melville, the supervising pharmacist at the Melville branch of MOMS Pharmacy, was accused of accepting bribes to purchase more than $274 million in black-market HIV medications from shell companies created around the nation.

Pharmacist Ira Gross, 58, of Babylon, who operated his own drug services company, brokered the sale of illegally obtained drugs between Schabel and another defendant, Stephen Manuel Costa, 27, a Florida resident who ran the distribution companies, Schneiderman said.

Harry Abolafia, 64, of San Antonio, Texas, created false invoices to make the transactions appear legitimate, according to an indictment.

Schneiderman said Costa operated the shell companies and paid the others from his profits: $21 million to Gross, $5 million to Schabel and $1.4 million to Abolafia.

The defendants face charges including bribery, money laundering, conspiracy, grand larceny and criminal diversion of prescription medications, all felonies. One corporation, Nuline Pharmaceuticals, also was indicted.

""The ringleaders of this complex scheme not only cheated the state Medicaid program out of millions of dollars, but preyed on some of New York's most vulnerable patients just to make a quick buck,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. ""These crimes are intolerable, and the perpetrators will be held accountable for breaking the law.""

MOMS officials said they had no knowledge of Schabel's alleged activities until contacted by law enforcement, and then cooperated with the investigation. Schneiderman aides confirmed the account. The company said that after learning of the investigation, it helped remove any illegal products from the store.

""MOMS Pharmacy was a victim of this crime and will continue to cooperate fully with the New York State authorities to see that those involved are brought to justice,"" Anthony Luna, president of MOMS Pharmacy, said in a statement. ""The health and safety of our patients is our first priority, and we are doing all we can to make sure nothing like this happens again.""

Luna said that there is no evidence to date that medications distributed to MOMS' patients have caused any health problems. Schabel has been fired.

Attempts to reach Schabel were unsuccessful. Gross didn't return a phone call seeking comment.

The conspiracy began in 2008 and continued until February, when law enforcement intercepted a delivery of more than $1 million in illegal medications to the MOMS branch at 45 Melville Park Rd., the attorney general's office said.

NewsDay,Ann McFeatters: Talk about aging of U.S.,"WASHINGTON -- We have yet to hear baby boomers Barack Obama and Mitt Romney outline solutions to the social upheaval that tens of millions of Americans living beyond 80 will bring.

As the nation awaits the Supreme Court's decision in June on President Barack Obama's health care mandate, sociologists say we are entirely unprepared for the ramifications of people living decades longer with chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, arthritis and diabetes.

The ""age wave,"" a term coined by gerontologist Ken Dychtwald, will bring unprecedented change to society as one Social Security recipient is supported by only two workers, as the nation's resources are further strained, as politicians fear talking about the potentially frightening situation.

The nation is just beginning to deal with the fact of 80 million retiring baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964). Ten thousand boomers are turning 65 every day. Every decade, life expectancy increases two and a half years. Dychtwald notes that two-thirds of those who ever lived past 65 in the history of the world are alive today.

The biggest factor in the downgrading of the U.S. economy by Standard & Poor's was the soaring cost of health care faced by an aging nation.

In a recent speech on Capitol Hill, Dychtwald (who pitches his worries to leaders from former President Bill Clinton to Nelson Mandela) says the ""new old"" want to stay engaged, reinvent themselves and live with purpose. But pensions and job opportunities are lagging. Even worse, as medical breakthroughs have made dying early from infection, polio or smallpox less likely, millions live in misery, suffering from chronic diseases that destroy an active life.

Dychtwald's friend George Vradenburg, chairman of USAgainstAlzheimer's, says if the nation spent $200 billion on Alzheimer's research instead of $500 million, Alzheimer's could be mostly eliminated by 2020.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the 13 percent of the population that is older than 65 accounts for 27 percent of visits to doctors and 38 percent of all hospital stays. But Medicare covers only about 50 percent of most beneficiaries' health-care costs and doesn't reimburse for long-term care.

""We are spending enormous sums of money on the wrong things and, not surprisingly, the results are both mediocre and costly,"" Dychtwald says.

Heart disease causes more adult deaths than all other causes and costs $500 billion a year. Half of all cancer patients are 65 or older; cancer costs $263 billion a year. Strokes disable more adults than anything else and cost $156 billion a year.

Alzheimer's, which frightens more people than any other illness, costs $170 billion a year. The cost of caring for the bedridden elderly is $172 billion a year.

But Dychtwald observes that Americans have often overcome huge problems -- landing on the moon, turning HIV from an immediate death sentence to a manageable disease, eliminating the iron lungs that polio victims were condemned to inhabit.

Dychtwald has solutions. Americans must pay more attention to -- and spend more money on -- scientific research to cure, delay or eliminate diseases affecting the elderly. Health care professionals must become proficient in aging issues -- only 13 of 126 fully accredited U.S. medical schools have full geriatrics departments.

Americans must prepare for aging by not smoking and not becoming obese, and exercising and eating properly. Genetics is less important than personal behavior in living a long, healthy life.

Home-based care is better and less expensive than care in institutions. One-third of older Americans fall annually; Dychtwald suggests using Wii games to train them to improve their balance.

Dychtwald posits that if Americans do not develop a more respectful, humane and cost-effective approach to death and dying, the demand for euthanasia will certainly arise.

Obama and Romney should talk about these issues, not the strange topics we have heard debated so far this election year.

NewsDay,Pesticides may be shrinking bee population,"WASHINGTON -- A common class of pesticide is causing problems for honeybees and bumblebees, species already in trouble, two studies suggest.

But the findings don't explain all the reasons behind a long-running bee decline, and other experts found one of the studies less than convincing.

The new research suggests the chemicals used in the pesticide, designed to attack the central nervous system of insects, reduces the weight and number of queens in bumblebee hives. The pesticides also cause honeybees to become disoriented and fail to return to their hives, the researchers concluded.

The two studies were published online yesterday in the journal Science.

Just last week activists filed a petition with more than a million signatures asking the government to ban the class of pesticides called neonicotinoids. The Environmental Protection Agency said it is re-evaluating the chemicals.

For more than a decade, pollinators of all types have been in decline, mostly because of habitat loss and perhaps some pesticide use. In the past five years, a new mysterious honeybee problem, colony collapse disorder, has further attacked hives. But over the last couple of years, that problem has been observed a bit less, said Jeff Pettis, lead bee researcher at the Department of Agriculture's lab in Beltsville, Md. -- AP",29/03/2012
NewsDay,Suffolk rejected Foley nursing home bids,"With budget deadlines looming, Suffolk County has rejected three potential buyers who made bids last fall to purchase the John J. Foley Skilled Nursing Facility in Yaphank.

The bids came to light Wednesday after a discussion at the nursing home advisory committee. Health Commissioner Dr. James Tomarken said that letters were sent to bidders last week rejecting their offers as too low. Officials declined to identify bidders or their offers.

The county about a month ago rejected a proposal from Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center for a public-private partnership, saying the plan lacked enough detail.

The new administration of County Executive Steve Bellone must decide by next month what to do with the five-story, 264-bed nursing home that former County Executive Steve Levy repeatedly tried to sell or close as a cost drain on the county. A decision is needed because the nursing home is fully funded for only half the year, and layoff notices would need to go out next month if it is to be sold or closed.

Deputy County Executive Jon Schneider said officials are taking a ""fresh look"" at all options. ""Clearly this has been a divisive issue,"" he said. ""But we're looking at massive layoffs, a $530 million hole, and we can't continue to subsidize annual losses of seven figures.""

Bellone aides estimate the annual nursing home losses at $7 million to $10 million, a figure similar to Levy's estimate.

Legis. John M. Kennedy Jr. (R-Nesconset), the minority leader, said the county should continue operations because Foley is the only Suffolk site for hard-to-place patients, the lone site with HIV beds, and a last resort for those needing long-term care.

The rejected proposals were sought by Levy last summer and returned in October. In his final 2012 budget, Levy called for the county to close the facility if no buyer were found. After Bellone was elected, Levy left the decision to his successor. The county legislature restored nursing home funds through June.",28/03/2012
NewsDay,"Kids, adults get into the trapeze swing of things","Devyn Warren of East Northport yearned to fly. But not in the friendly skies with a pilot in the cockpit. She was thinking along the lines of . . . the flying trapeze.

Last year, the 9-year-old's parents granted her wish, and Devyn set out for Eisenhower Park in East Meadow for a class with I.fly Flying Trapeze. She enjoyed her session so much that she begged her parents to sign her up again, which they did.

""She's very daring,"" said mom Christine Warren, who has a thing about vertical space. ""I'm afraid of heights,"" she admits.

Though flying trapeze requires a willingness to climb steps 23 feet high to mount a narrow base, the real daredevil element is the leap off the platform while holding onto a horizontal bar suspended from parallel ropes. The thrill is up in the air, where fliers can perform all sorts of moves, such as knee hangs, back flips and catches (synchronized so a flying instructor grabs another flier's wrists in mid-swing). Of course, before all of this can happen, instruction is required.

""Basic instruction takes place on the ground first,"" said Anthony Rosamilia, 33, who co-owns I.fly with his brother, Marco, 35. The siblings, who grew up in Franklin Square, launched the company in 2006, after both trained and worked as circus instructors and performers at Club Med resorts in the Caribbean, Mexico and Florida. Their students are usually amateurs and thrill seekers.

""Club Med is known as the largest circus school in the world, based on how many resorts and programs they have,"" he said. Learning how to fly a trapeze is one of the more popular activities with resort guests.

It was at the Sandpiper Bay Club Med in Florida where Sherry Amatenstein, of Long Island City, tried it out in early March. ""I did the trapeze because at 50, I still like to be up doing things that scare me, though I made sure to tell the instructor that I wasn't out to do any 'tricks,' just to survive, and that's what I did,"" said the clinical social worker.

Boost from Cirque, clubs

The popularity of recreational flying trapeze has been on an upswing due to the programs at Club Med and Cirque du Soleil, according to Marco Rosamilia. So they decided to open their own trapeze school to share the adventure with Long Islanders.

They operate seasonally from April to October but have had to relocate several times. Due to resident complaints, in 2009, I.fly was denied a variance renewal by the Town of Smithtown to continue operating from the Ivy League School and Day Camp.

""We're a unique business,"" said Anthony Rosamilia, ""and there's misinformation about our activities, safety, there are misconceptions. People don't know what to think about it, in terms of insurance, landlords . . . It's a hard sell, and it's easier to say no than to say yes.""

Tanglewood Preserve in Rockville Centre did allow I.fly to operate on their premises, and that's where Girl Scouts of Nassau County production coordinator Anna Lenz had her singular trapeze experience two years ago, during a leadership retreat. Given the option of workshops in embroidery, jewelry making, yoga and such, ""I wanted to try something I'd never done before,"" said Lenz, 45, of Lynbrook, adding that the experience was all at once frightening, empowering and fun.

Today, thrill seekers can take to the trapeze at the aquatic center at Eisenhower Park, I.fly's headquarters since 2011. Before anyone can fly, he or she must sign an insurance waiver. Pregnant women, anyone with a heart issue, recent surgery, and/or with a condition that would be adversely affected by physical exertion, cannot participate. Other than that, as long as they can understand direction, children as young as 4 can fly a trapeze.

Lessons, harness, net

Preflight on-the-ground lessons include step-by-step demonstrations by the instructors, with introductions to basic positions, such as the knee hang (bringing knees to the chest). And all participants are securely harnessed to safety belts and lines, which are manned by instructors on the ground. I.fly utilizes a custom, handmade net for landings.

""At first I was nervous, but then I felt really safe,"" Devyn said of her initial flying trapeze experience. She said the instructors were patient and encouraging.

""The first time I just hung on the bar,"" she said. But after several attempts during one session, she was able to complete several complex maneuvers.

Devyn had such a great time that she wanted to have a flying trapeze birthday party at the facility, but it was closing for the season. And it can be pricey, adds her mother.

Classes last 90 minutes, are typically limited to 10 people and begin April 7. The fee is $50 for a weekday session and $55 on weekends.

Anthony Rosamilia said that flying trapeze is an out-of-the box activity that boosts self-esteem, making it ideal for children and teens and as a team-building exercise for corporations and nonprofits, such as the Girl Scouts.

Lenz would agree.

""I was scared to death but so happy I got to do it,"" she said. ""It was on my bucket list, and it made me want to do other things.""

Fun facts

Jules Leotard of Toulouse, France, designed the first flying trapeze and practiced his acrobatics in his father's gymnasium until he mastered the apparatus. In 1859, he performed in public for the first time in the Cirque Napoleon (now the Cirque d'hiver), popularizing flying trapeze worldwide. But the toned and limber aerialist also became known for his wardrobe -- a tight-fitting, one-piece garment called a leotard.

NewsDay,Oketch: Bigger worries than Joseph Kony,"GULU, Uganda -- The people of northern Uganda generally, and my own Lango ethnic tribal group in particular, would be very happy if they never heard the name Joseph Kony again.

So it was with a sense of dismay when I learned that Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army were once again thrust into the public eye by a 30-minute video produced by a San Diego-based advocacy group, Invisible Children. Within a matter of days, the YouTube video, produced by filmmaker Jason Russell, had been viewed more than 80 million times and had become an Internet sensation.

Invisible Children calls on people to lobby U. S. lawmakers to maintain military advisers for the Ugandan military, and to wear bracelets to publicize Kony's name and ensure he is captured by the end of the year.

I am dismayed that it is only now that the world has shown an interest in Kony. To my mind, this campaign reflects the self-interest of a Western-based advocacy group.

I should have thought Kony would have become famous when he killed dozens of innocent civilians in Burcoro, Gulu district, in 1987, or after the Atiak massacre in April 1995. Wasn't the LRA invasion of Teso in eastern Uganda in June 2003 and the abduction of hundreds of people enough to make him famous? How about the murder of hundreds of people in Barlonyo, Lira district, in February 2004? Twenty years of these intense attacks against a government incapable of protecting the lives and property of ordinary Ugandans was more than enough to make Kony well known to all of us.

If there is anybody longing for justice for the atrocities committed against northern Ugandans, it's me. I lost two brothers who were abducted in LRA attacks in 1998. I also want to see justice done for the dozens of other relatives killed during the war.

But is an anti-Kony media campaign really what we need right now? While the world's attention is focused on Kony, the issues of greatest concern to Ugandans right now -- disease and displacement -- are being ignored. We don't see anything about them in the foreign media.

The biggest and most immediate issues are how to stop our children dying of malaria, HIV/AIDS-related infections and other diseases.

For example, children in northern Uganda are currently falling victim to a mysterious illness known as ""nodding disease,"" a fatal, mentally and physically disabling disease.

The first cases were reported in 2008, but little was done to prevent the disease escalating from spreading. Today, northern Uganda faces with a full-scale epidemic.

While treatment centers have opened in several northern districts, there is growing concern that the government is devoting insufficient resources to battle the disease.

Meanwhile, the world is talking about Kony -- six years after he left Uganda.

Should the hunt for Kony and his few remaining followers continue? Of course. Should every effort be made to bring him to justice? Absolutely.

But the truth is there are greater issues facing Uganda today than Joseph Kony. We need to concentrate on peace-building, redevelopment, reconciliation, and educating our children. Now at last we are in a position to start improving the lives of our people.

NewsDay,Obama names health expert for World Bank,"WASHINGTON -- Passing over better-known candidates, President Barack Obama on Friday nominated global health expert and Dartmouth College president Jim Yong Kim to lead the World Bank. It was a surprise pick aimed in part at fending off challenges from developing nations eager to end the U.S. monopoly of the top job at the international institution.

Obama's appointment all but guarantees Kim, a 52-year-old physician and pioneer in treating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis in the developing world, will take the helm of the World Bank. Though he was born in South Korea, he will extend a tradition of American presidents dating back to 1944.

The 187-nation World Bank focuses on fighting poverty and promoting development. It is a leading source of loans for countries seeking financing to build dams, roads and other infrastructure projects.

Several developing nations had sought to break the U.S. leadership streak when Bank president Robert Zoellick said he would step down at the end of June. That put Obama in the position of balancing his desire to see emerging economies step forward on the world stage and the pressures of an election year. His support for a non-U.S. candidate could have provoked criticism from Republicans.

As Obama announced the nomination from the White House Rose Garden, he tried to make the case Kim would be a committed representative of the developing world's interests. ""Jim has truly global experience. He has worked from Asia to Africa to the Americas, from capitals to small villages,"" Obama said. ""His personal story exemplifies the great diversity to our country. . . . It's time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency.

The World Bank's 25-member executive board will officially select a new president next month. Given that the United States has the largest percentage of the votes, Kim is expected to prevail. Still, there may be some resistance that the developing world should take the reins at an organization focused on addressing its needs.",23/03/2012
NewsDay,CDC: U.S. TB infections drop to record low,"U.S. cases of tuberculosis fell 6.4 percent in 2011 to an all-time low, but missed a national target of eliminating the disease as cases among foreign-born individuals persisted, health officials said on Thursday.

Unless factors change significantly, the United States will not be able to eliminate TB - meaning fewer than one case per one million people - until the year 2100, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Addressing the increasing difference between TB rates in foreign-born and U.S.-born persons is critical for TB elimination,"" the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease, which was released ahead of World TB Day on March 24.

Overall, U.S. TB rates last year fell to 10,521 reported cases, or 3.4 cases per 100,000 people, the lowest level since national reporting began in 1953, the CDC said.

Despite these gains, the airborne infection is proving difficult to tame in some populations, especially among foreign-born individuals, blacks, Asians and people infected with HIV.

TB rates were 12 times higher among people born outside the United States. Of these infected individuals, more than half of the cases originated in just five countries: Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, and China, the CDC said.

Compared with whites, TB rates were seven times higher for Hispanics, eight times higher for blacks and 25 times higher for Asians last year.

Four states - California, Texas, New York and Florida - account for nearly half of all TB cases in the United States, according to the report.

TB is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. It can be cured with antibiotics but they must be taken daily for months to be effective. Because people do not always take the drugs as directed, multiple drug-resistant strains have emerged.

Cases of TB that are resistant to at least two common treatments, known as multidrug-resistant TB, accounted for 109 of all U.S. TB cases in 2010, the most recent year for which there are data. Foreign-born individuals accounted for 90 of these cases.

There were 4 cases of extensively drug-resistant TB - an infection that resists the most highly effective drugs - reported in the United States in 2010, all among foreign-born people.

The World Health Organization estimates that a third of the world's population is infected with the bacteria that cause TB. Last year, TB made nearly 9 million people sick and killed some 1.45 million people, according to WHO.",22/03/2012
NewsDay,Great Neck man wants to ease chicken ban,"About a year ago, Alfred Basal bought six chicks and brought them home to his three sons.

Months later, ""they began giving me eggs every morning,"" Basal said.

But in February, the Village of Great Neck discovered his backyard chicken coop and gave Basal 10 days to get rid of the chickens, which his sons, aged 4, 6 and 8, have given names including Fluffy, Chickie, Chirpie and Cutie.

Considered nuisance animals like pigs, goats and donkeys, chickens are banned in the village. Basal wants to change that.

""I don't want to give them away,"" said Basal's son Brandon, 8. The chickens, he said, produce about six eggs a day.

The elder Basal appeared at the March 6 board of trustees meeting, with supporters and a petition of more than 100 signatures asking that chickens be stricken from the nuisance animal list. Roosters, however, would remain.

""I'm not asking for a rooster, because a rooster makes a lot of noise,"" Basal said. ""A chicken does not need a rooster to make eggs.""

Basal said the chickens are educational for his children, provide an organic source of food and produce a fertilizer far safer than store-bought brands filled with chemicals.

Village officials are considering the request -- one they hadn't considered before, Mayor Ralph Kreitzman said.

""Our village isn't Kings Point where they have 1-acre zoning"" that can accommodate animals generally associated with farms, he said. ""It's something we're going to have to think about.""

Villages across Long Island handle the issue of chickens in a variety of ways.

Centre Island, Hempstead, Great Neck Plaza, Greenport and Port Washington North do not allow chickens.

Freeport allows as many as two chickens, ducks or geese to be kept as household pets. In Amityville, fowl must be kept 200 yards away from neighboring homes. In East Hills, chickens are banned, as are reptiles and bee hives. Horses are allowed.

Fowl in East Hampton are prohibited if they affect public peace or health and those found running at large can be sold at public auction.

Islandia has a seven-part provision relating to chickens, which are allowed but only in backyards enclosed by a fence and no more than 15 can be kept per 500 square feet of backyard.

Properties with chickens get checked periodically, said Michael Zaleski, an Islandia code enforcement officer. The village stresses daily cleaning as coop areas can attract cockroaches, flies and rats. ""A lot of rats start coming around,"" he said. ""They're drawn to the food. It's the nature of the beast.""

Great Neck has no animal control department and only a handful of code enforcement employees. ""One of my concerns is policing"" any change to allow chickens, Kreitzman said, adding a decision on Basal's request isn't likely until late April.",19/03/2012
NewsDay,State: Nassau can't use public health lab,"Nassau County can no longer use its public health lab to test for communicable diseases because it does not have a properly credentialed director, state officials said.

The prior director, Rodger Silletti, who was laid off in December, has not been replaced nor has the county announced an alternate plan for its routine clinical testing.

County Legis. Judi Bosworth (D-Great Neck), a member of the legislature's health and social services committee, said she is concerned about the apparent lack of a plan. ""We deserve to have a county that is going to provide for public health,"" she said. ""It seems to me you can't cut so close to the bone that we can't provide for basic services.""

The county refused to talk about the lab except to say that the health department ""is evaluating all laboratory processes in the public health laboratory as a means of becoming more efficient and streamlined.""

Silletti, who has a doctorate in molecular biology and certification by the American Board of Medical Microbiology, had the credentials to run both the clinical section, which tests for communicable diseases such as sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis, and the environmental part of the lab, which tests for contaminants in water, soil and air.

With Silletti's departure the lab was left with no one properly certified to run the clinical section, including Health Commissioner Lawrence Eisenstein. Department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain said last month he had taken over the lab.

For a short period, while the county either looked for another director or came up with an alternate plan, Nassau could send clinical specimens for testing to the state's Wadsworth lab outside Albany, county and state officials said.

Sign up for the Power on Trial newsletter Get our insider's look and analysis of the key moments in the Manganos' retrial. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But as of Feb. 29, Nassau, because it did not replace Silletti, lost its certification to operate the clinical section, state health officials said. The state Health Department also has informed Nassau that Wadsworth will not be able to perform its clinical testing, department spokesman Peter Constantakes said.

The environmental section continues to operate ""in full compliance"" with state regulations, the county said.

County plans unclear

The county has not announced its plans for how routine communicable disease testing will be handled. Many counties in the state, including Suffolk, contract out those specimens to commercial labs. But Nassau has used its own lab for routine testing.

Constantakes called clinical lab testing ""an important aspect of protecting public health"" but said ""there are many options, including the use of private labs, that meet local needs for testing specimens.""

The county health department said this week, ""Due to pending litigation, Nassau County Department of Health is unable to respond to Newsday's inquiry regarding the Public Health Laboratory. Public health is not impacted by changes that may have occurred at the lab.""

Silletti, who declined to comment, and two others laid off from the lab are part of a class-action grievance filed by the Civil Service Employees Association, said Ryan Mulholland, spokesman for CSEA Nassau Local 830. The union has filed a second grievance for Silletti claiming that his position has been taken by a nonunion worker.

Silletti and five others lost their jobs at the 17-person lab as part of the county's effort to balance its budget, union officials said.

Under state Department of Health regulations, the lab's environmental section can be headed by someone with a minimum of 24 college credits in chemistry and two years' lab experience. But to run the clinical section, the person must either be a pathologist, have a doctoral degree and board certification or, for physicians other than pathologists, four years' experience in the lab.

Public health needs cited

CSEA Local 830 president Jerry Laricchiuta said the county should make clear its plan for future testing. ""They shouldn't drag their feet on this,"" he said. ""They should move forward. We still have a county to run. Public health is a basic function.""

Victor Waddell, president of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said, ""The funding pressures confronting the public health laboratory in Nassau County are very similar to the pressures that challenge many state and local laboratories.""

""It is incumbent that county officials now ensure that the changes they implement will meet the public health needs of their citizens,"" he said.

Testing at Nassau's public health lab

The clinical lab tests for communicable diseases such as:

--Tuberculosis

--Sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV

--Viruses, including hepatitis B, measles, mumps

--Other public health threats such as meningitis

The environmental lab tests:

--Beach water

--Drinking water from the tap

--Water from sewage treatment plants

--Lead at day care centers

--Soil lead and mercury

NewsDay,Magic Johnson glad he didn't pass up ESPN documentary,"Twenty years later, the sentiment at first seems unremarkable. Why wouldn't Magic Johnson say he planned to go on ""living for a long time,"" that he would ""beat it"" and ""have fun""?

So thoroughly has he succeeded that people under 30 must wonder what the fuss was about when their elders talk about Magic Johnson's revelation on Nov. 7, 1991, that he had ""attained"" the virus that causes AIDS.

That historical disconnect was a key reason that Johnson agreed, reluctantly, to participate in an ESPN documentary, ""The Announcement,"" that premieres at 9 p.m. Sunday. He even serves as the narrator.

His concern was that treatment for HIV has become so effective -- with Johnson as Exhibit A -- that the public no longer fears AIDS as it once did, and often forgets that it even exists.

""This is not something he ever wanted to do, but he was convinced it was the right thing to do,"" Lon Rosen, his longtime friend and agent, said after a screening last week. ""It's off the front pages, and because it's off the front pages, medical science is sort of looking at other things.""

Johnson eventually determined he was comfortable with ESPN and the production team, including director Nelson George, whose sister, Andrea Williams, is HIV-positive and an AIDS activist.

The biggest coup was the participation of Johnson's wife, Cookie, who in the documentary speaks more extensively on the subject than she had.

Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

George said he was struck by how much more composed Cookie was as she looked back than were most of the men he interviewed, including Johnson's former Lakers coach, Pat Riley.

The film is loaded with video nuggets from the NBA's archives. One shows Riley, by then the Knicks' coach, working out Johnson, in Lakers attire, at Madison Square Garden after many peers had shunned him. Johnson said it was a day that changed his life. ""Gold,"" George said. ""That's just amazing footage.""

Most of all, the documentary serves as a reminder of how far public perception and medical reality have come on HIV/AIDS during the past two decades.

Karl Malone, long cast as the villain in the treatment of Johnson, speaks candidly about his initial feeling and his evolution since. Malone was the most prominent of many players who expressed concern about being on the court with Johnson. Rosen said Malone and Johnson have discussed the matter directly, that Malone has apologized and that Johnson holds no grudges.

Magic is not a grudge-holding sort, part of the positive attitude he said helped him last this long.

""I believed it a hundred percent,"" he said on a recent conference call with journalists, recalling his initial optimism. ""I never thought I was going to die . . . So I believe besides the medicine, my mind-set and attitude -- and also working out -- has been the key for me being around for a long time.""

The challenge is to make the most of the time few people other than Johnson himself believed he would have.

""It's been amazing how much we have been able to do in these 20 years,"" he said. ""So, yeah, I'm happy about the progress. But we've got a lot of work still ahead.""",08/03/2012
NewsDay,Commune life in Lauren Groff's 'Arcadia',"ARCADIA, by Lauren Groff. Voice / Hyperion, 291 pp., $25.99

The rise and fall of a 1960s commune is at the heart of Lauren Groff's second novel, ""Arcadia,"" the follow-up to her much-celebrated ""The Monsters of Templeton."" Although this utopian community is founded as a means to empower and unite people, over the years it evolves into a destructive force that shatters a number of lives.

Ridley Sorrel Stone, known as ""Bit,"" lives with his parents, Abe and Hannah, in Arcadia, a vegan commune in western New York. It's led by a charismatic guru, Handy, who has a ""main"" wife, Astrid, with whom he has four children, and a second wife, Lila. Never mind that he's a terrible father and engaging in affairs with 18-year-old girls. Handy always knows how to work his charm -- ""there is a switch inside him that he can flick on and off.""

As Abe explains one day to Bit, their community exists on the perimeter of society: ""Pure,"" he says. ""Live with the land, not on it. Live outside the evil of commerce and make our own lives from scratch. Let our love be a beacon to light up the world."" The children learn to chop wood, play guitar, knit, bake and ""make anything at all from soy.""

While Abe is ""beamy and talky,"" eager to please, Hannah, guarded and depressed, often cuts herself off from the community. She becomes increasingly cynical about Arcadia's bizarre rules -- no one is allowed to wear contact lenses, for instance, because ""they separate you from the spiritual world."" Hannah is among the first to complain about its dire dysfunction, such as overcrowding and a lack of food. Over time, Arcadia declines into sheer chaos, with internal fighting, grabs for power, crippling debt, police raids and hundreds of Arcadians charged with selling drugs.

Bit, innocent and optimistic, is a wonderful protagonist -- he's a quiet, sensitive, observant boy who understands that there is always ""what happens on the surface, and there is what pulls beneath."" When he can't cope with what's around him, he retreats to dreams. ""The world is sometimes too much for Bit,"" Groff writes, ""too full of terror and beauty. Every day he finds himself squeezed under a new astonishment."" He often struggles to lift his mother from depression, and suffers guilt when he can't. When he falls in love with a fellow Arcadian named Helle, one of Handy's troubled daughters, he finds a welcome distraction from worrying about his mother's well-being. Bit's intense relationship with Helle lasts for decades, but it will leave him grief-stricken and alone in the end.

""Arcadia"" spans a 50-year period, tracing Bit's escape from Arcadia to ""the gritty Outside"" at the age of 14, a transition that proves a difficult and painful adjustment. ""He knew nobody and filled his time by walking for hours,"" Groff writes. Yet Bit makes his way to college at Cornell, and learns to achieve a kind of peace with the Outside. Eventually, he settles with his daughter, Grete, in New York City, where he teaches photography at a university and cares for his ailing parents from afar. Groff captures beautifully the sense of loss and regret that Bit endures, especially as he enters middle age: ""Grief as a low-grade fever. His sadness is a hive at the back of his head: he moves slowly to keep from being stung.""

At the end of the novel, Bit reminds himself that to keep going, it's crucial to pay attention ""not to the grand gesture, but to the passing breath."" In a sense, this describes what Lauren Groff has achieved with this fine novel. Throughout, she's attentive to the smallest details, and ""Arcadia"" builds its power in a subtle, cumulative way. Somehow the author manages an epic sweep with her narrative, yet one that also feels intimate and concentrated. Arguably, in the novel's final section, an Indonesia-based pandemic tossed into the plot seems a slight misstep. But Groff is out to show us that peace ""can be shattered in a million variations,"" and she offers an ending that's both tragic and hopeful -- one in which life for Bit is not exactly good, but it's good enough, at least for the moment.",08/03/2012
NewsDay,Uncertain risks torment Japanese in nuclear zone,"FUKUSHIMA, Japan - Yoshiko Ota keeps her windows shut. She never hangs her laundry outdoors. Fearful of birth defects, she warns her daughters: Never have children.

This is life with radiation, nearly one year after a tsunami-hit nuclear power plant began spewing it into Ota's neighborhood, 40 miles (60 kilometers) away. She's so worried that she has broken out in hives.

""The government spokesman keeps saying there are no IMMEDIATE health effects,"" the 48-year-old nursery school worker says. ""He's not talking about 10 years or 20 years later. He must think the people of Fukushima are fools.

""It's not really OK to live here,"" she says. ""But we live here.""

Ota takes metabolism-enhancing pills in hopes of flushing radiation out of her body. To limit her exposure, she goes out of her way to buy vegetables that are not grown locally. She spends 10,000 yen ($125) a month on bottled water to avoid the tap water. She even mail-ordered a special machine to dehusk her family's rice.

Not everyone resorts to such measures, but a sense of unease pervades the residents of Fukushima. Some have moved away. Everyone else knows they are living with an invisible enemy.

Radiation is still leaking from the now-closed Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, though at a slower pace than it did in the weeks after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. It's not immediately fatal but could show up as cancer or other illnesses years later.

The uncertainty breeds fear. Some experts say the risks are quite low outside the 20-kilometer (12-mile) no-go zone, and people can take steps to protect themselves, such as limiting intake of locally grown food, not lingering in radiation ""hot spots"" such as around gutters and foliage, and periodically living outside the area. But risks are much higher for children, and no one can say for sure what level of exposure is safe.

What's clear is Fukushima will serve as a test case that the world is watching for long-term exposure to low-dose radiation.

More than 280,000 people live in Fukushima city alone, though some have left, and many more live in surrounding towns, including many of the 100,000 who have been evacuated from the no-go zone.

""People are scared to death,"" says Wolfgang Weiss, chairman of the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, which is studying Fukushima. ""They are thinking, 'Tell me. Is it good or bad?' We can't tell them. ... Life is risky.""

It hasn't helped that the government has given only the most optimistic scenarios of the risks to avoid mass panic.

Public skepticism of government assurances grew when the man appointed as health adviser for Fukushima prefecture, Shunichi Yamashita, repeatedly said exposure to 100 millisieverts of radiation a year was safe.

Studies have found that cancer risks rise at an annual exposure of 100 millsieverts or above but aren't statistically detectable at lower levels. Below 100, experts can't say for sure whether it's safe, just that a link to cancer can't be proven.

In Fukushima and nearby areas, outside the 20-kilometer evacuation zone, the annual exposure is 20 millisieverts in some places and as high as 50 in others. Before the disaster, people in Japan were exposed to about 1 millisievert of natural background radiation a year; in the United States the average is about 3 millisieverts.

The controversy earned Yamashita a nickname: ""Mr. 100 Millisieverts."" Toshiso Kosako, a professor at the University of Tokyo's graduate school, stepped down as government adviser last year in a tearful protest of Yamashita's views.

Kouta Miyazaki is among those who have lost confidence in the government.

""Government officials should all come live in Fukushima for several years and bring their families. They're all staying in places where it's safe,"" Miyazaki says. ""We're being told to get radiated and drop dead.""

Miyazaki, 40, closed his online business selling Fukushima peaches; he doubts anyone would buy them now. He plans to move away with his 15-year-old son, although that would mean living separately for a while from his wife, who works as a counselor in Fukushima.

The nature of the threat has changed over time. Initially, it was exposure to the large releases of radiation from explosions at the plant. The risk from leaks remains but at a much reduced level.

These days, the main danger is less obvious but just as real: consuming contaminated food and water and ingesting radioactive particles. Radioactive material has accumulated in gutters where rainwater collects and shrubs with leaves that suck in radiation.

The risk is cumulative. The radioactivity in one's body builds up through various activities, including eating contaminated food every day or staying in a hot spot for an extended period.

Schools are restricting outdoor activities, and radiation meters dot the streets. Some people are using their own devices to measure radioactivity.

At area hospitals, thousands of people are on waiting lists to get their radiation levels measured with whole-body counters. One child at Minami Soma Hospital, southeast of Fukushima, was found with 2,653 becquerels of radioactive cesium.

It's a big number, but is it dangerous? Jacques Lochard, an International Commission on Radiological Protection official advising Fukushima prefecture, says the child's exposure could amount to as little as 0.3 millisieverts a year, or as much as 8 millisieverts, depending on how the child was exposed to the radiation.

All most residents know is that their bodies are contaminated. What the numbers mean is unanswered.

Kunihiko Takeda, a nuclear and ecology expert who has been more outspoken about the dangers than many others, says people become less afraid after he explains the risks.

""They are freed from the state of not knowing,"" says Takeda, who has a blog with instructions on how parents can protect their children from radiation. ""They now know what to do and can make decisions on their own.""

Lochard says he was sad to hear about a Fukushima woman whose children were too afraid to bring her grandchildren from Tokyo for visits. All the parents need to do, he said, is bring food from home and keep the children indoors.

Still, Lochard says, ""There is no safe level. It is a small risk but not zero.""

After the 1986 Chernobyl accident, more than 6,000 thyroid cancers clearly linked to radioactive iodine were found in children and adolescents. A study by Weiss' U.N. committee found exposure to iodine was lower in Fukushima than at Chernobyl. Still, parents are worried because the Chernobyl cancers didn't emerge until a couple of years later.

""Nobody can say this is over. I'd be the last to say that,"" Weiss says.

Mayor Shouji Nishida of Date, a city of 66,000 people in Fukushima prefecture, says his community is preparing for the future by relying less on the central government, and by adjusting expectations. He believes 5 millisieverts of radiation a year — five times the typical amount of background radiation in Japan — is a realistic goal.

""We are defining policies to live and coexist with radiation,"" he says.",07/03/2012
NewsDay,U.S. report: HIV rate down in needle-drug users,"ATLANTA - There's some good news from the AIDS front: Fewer needle drug users are testing positive for HIV.

U.S. health officials said Thursday the rate has dropped by half since the 1990s. The decline may be related to a growth in needle exchange programs.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the study. More than 10,000 drug users in 20 metropolitan areas were surveyed and tested for HIV in 2009. About 1 in 10 tested positive for the virus, compared to roughly 1 in 5 in the 1990s.

The study also found that only about half of infected drug users know they carry the AIDS virus — the first time a CDC study has come up with such a statistic.

Addicts who inject heroin, cocaine or other drugs have been one of the groups hit hardest by the AIDS epidemic. Injection drug users account for about 17 percent of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV. The CDC recommends drug users get tested at least once a year.

HIV spreads among drug users mainly through unprotected sex and the sharing of needles. Needle exchange programs provide clean needles to addicts, and the number of such programs has grown from nearly 70 in the mid-1990s to more than 180 in 2008.

It's been more than a decade since the CDC last did a large-scale analysis of how common HIV is in injection drug users, said Cyprian Wejnert, the study's lead author.

There was some bad news in the study, too. The proportion of injection drug users tested annually for HIV has dropped from 66 percent in 2006 to 49 percent in 2009. CDC officials say they aren't sure why testing has declined.",05/03/2012
NewsDay,NBA Insider: Rod Thorn wishes he saw Jeremy Lin coming,"Rod Thorn was the man who drafted Michael Jordan and then changed the Nets' franchise by trading for Jason Kidd, but he never saw Jeremy Lin coming.

Thorn wishes he had.

Thorn, now president of the Philadelphia 76ers, was running the Nets when Lin was bypassed in the June 2010 draft. Thorn said the Nets never considered Lin in the draft or free agency.

""I wish I could say we were,"" Thorn said. ""But the fact is no.

""Looking back at the scouting reports, back in the days when I was with the Nets, nobody was that high on him or felt he was going to be an NBA player.""

Thorn has been a part of the NBA or ABA as a player, coach and executive for nearly 50 years. He said he's never seen a player come out of nowhere the way Lin has and can't say why he was overlooked.

""Maybe it's because he went to Harvard, and so few players who come out of the Ivy League ever make any splash in the league,"" Thorn said. ""Maybe that's part of it. There's never been an Asian guard in the NBA that ever made his mark up to this point. I don't know. I can't explain it because he is good.

""He's energized people all over the place. A bunch of casual fans now have what they call Lin-sanity. People want to talk about him. It's just remarkable.""

Does Thorn have Lin-sanity? He laughed.

""I think about football with Kurt Warner. He was bagging groceries and the next thing you know, he's the MVP of the Super Bowl. It's a great thing to me that you can still have stories like that.""

Howard is the new Melo

Carmelo Anthony's future was the topic of conversation during All-Star Weekend last year.

Dwight Howard is Anthony one year later. With All-Star Weekend in Howard's current home of Orlando, his future is a main subject.

Anthony was traded to the Knicks the day after the All-Star Game. Howard probably won't be moved until right around the March 15 trade deadline, if at all.

The Magic is weighing whether to play out the season and take its chances in re-signing Howard in July. Orlando can offer him more than any other team, a fifth year at roughly $25 million. But it might not be smart to risk losing him without getting something back.

If he signs as a free agent to play with Deron Williams and the Nets in Brooklyn, Howard could make up that money in endorsements.

For now, he is with the Magic and trying to make this weekend about the All-Star festivities in Orlando.

""That's the only thing that matters right now,"" he said. ""This is the moment. This is All-Star Weekend. We're going to have fun and we're going to enjoy ourselves. All that stuff can go on after All-Star Weekend.""

The Nets and Lakers are leading candidates to trade for Howard. The Lakers probably will be among the most active teams heading up to the deadline. The Nets and Mavs are the favorites for Howard in July.

Happy anniversary, Magic

Magic Johnson produced one of the greatest, most inspiring moments in All-Star Game history 20 years ago in Orlando.

Just a few months after retiring because he contracted HIV, Johnson won the MVP with a 25-point, nine-assist performance. That was celebrated this week with the All-Star Game back in Orlando. Many of you probably remember watching it, seeing Magic hit those threes late in the game and his ever-present smile brightening up your television screen and downtown Orlando.

""I think it had a great impact on the world,"" Johnson said this past week. ""The way I played and performed let people know that I could still play. Then winning the MVP, hitting those three three-pointers in the fourth quarter just showed people, 'OK, Magic is back. He can play. He's OK. Yeah, you can play against him. Nothing's going to happen.' Those type of things.

""So it did a lot for the world. It did a lot for HIV and AIDS all at the same time. It did a lot for people dealing with not just HIV but anything else, that they can go on and live a productive life. So the NBA, that All-Star Game in Orlando educated the world, and it was great therapy for me.""",03/03/2012
NewsDay,US report: HIV rate down in needle-drug users,"ATLANTA - There's some good news from the AIDS front: Fewer needle drug users are testing positive for HIV.

U.S. health officials said Thursday the rate has dropped by half since the 1990s. The decline may be related to a growth in needle exchange programs.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the study. More than 10,000 drug users in 20 metropolitan areas were surveyed and tested for HIV in 2009. About 1 in 10 tested positive for the virus, compared to roughly 1 in 5 in the 1990s.

The study also found that only about half of infected drug users know they carry the AIDS virus — the first time a CDC study has come up with such a statistic.

Addicts who inject heroin, cocaine or other drugs have been one of the groups hit hardest by the AIDS epidemic. Injection drug users account for about 17 percent of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV. The CDC recommends drug users get tested at least once a year.

HIV spreads among drug users mainly through unprotected sex and the sharing of needles. Needle exchange programs provide clean needles to addicts, and the number of such programs has grown from nearly 70 in the mid-1990s to more than 180 in 2008.

It's been more than a decade since the CDC last did a large-scale analysis of how common HIV is in injection drug users, said Cyprian Wejnert, the study's lead author.

There was some bad news in the study, too. The proportion of injection drug users tested annually for HIV has dropped from 66 percent in 2006 to 49 percent in 2009. CDC officials say they aren't sure why testing has declined.",03/03/2012
NewsDay,Health fest honors Black History Month,"In a darkened Bay Shore auditorium Saturday, it was Topeka, Kan., in 1954 for a bit. A soldier escorted a scared young black girl as she desegregated a Kansas school and boys hurled hate at her.

""Go home!"" one of them shouted at the girl, who like all those on the Bay Shore Middle School stage Saturday were actually 2012 students re-enacting the result of the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. the Board of Education.

Meanwhile, in the cafeteria down the hall, an optometrist gave free vision tests, a poison-control expert warned against children confusing drugs and look-alike candy, women signed up for free mammograms, a longtime survivor of HIV discreetly handed out condoms and encouraged the public to take on-site HIV tests, and more.

It all played out as part of Suffolk County's third annual Gospel Health Fest, held in honor of Black History Month.

""We try to nurture the soul and give advice to strengthen the body,"" said Brandy Scott, chairwoman of the county African-American Advisory Board, one of the event's sponsors.

The handouts offering frank advice included: ""Understanding Lupus . . . One Piece at a Time""; ""Why Wait Now? Saying No If You've Had Sex Before. Sticking With Your Limits""; ""A Healthy Weight For You""; and the kids' coloring book ""Feel Good! Eat Healthy!""

Among the presenters was dietitian Constance Brown-Riggs, author of ""The African American Guide to Living Well With Diabetes.""

Genetics, in addition to lifestyle choices and other factors, make some groups disproportionately at risk, she said.

""Being black -- that's a major risk factor,"" she said, advising attendees to get diagnosed and educated about diabetes to prevent such consequences as amputation and blindness.

Back in the auditorium, the musical part of the afternoon kicked off in earnest with the 112-year-old song ""Lift Every Voice and Sing.""

In the spirit of the program blending health and music, the saxophonist was none other than the director of the county's Office of Minority Health, Dr. Gregson H. Pigott. Said emcee Darren Greggs, a gospel radio station program director: ""He got his Kenny G on!""",25/02/2012
NewsDay,Knicks insider: Thorn didn't see it,"Rod Thorn was the man who drafted Michael Jordan and changed the Nets' franchise by trading for Jason Kidd, but he never saw Jeremy Lin coming.

Thorn wishes he did.

Thorn, now the president of the Philadelphia 76ers, was running the Nets when Lin was bypassed in the draft in June 2010. Thorn said the Nets never considered Lin in the draft or free agency.

""I wish I could say we were,"" Thorn said. ""But the fact is no.

""Looking back at the scouting reports, back in the days when I was with the Nets, nobody was that high on him or felt he was going to be an NBA player.""

Thorn has been a part of the NBA or ABA as a player, coach and executive for nearly 50 years. He said he's never seen a player come out of nowhere the way Lin has and can't say with certainty why he was overlooked.

""Maybe it's because he went to Harvard, and so few players who come out of the Ivy League ever make any splash in the league,"" Thorn said. ""Maybe that's part of it. There's never been an Asian guard in the NBA that ever made his mark up to this point. I don't know. I can't explain it because he is good.

""He's energized people all over the place. A bunch of casual fans now have what they call Lin-sanity. People want to talk about him. It's just remarkable.""

Thorn laughed when he was asked if he has Lin-sanity?

""I watch him play,"" he said. ""I just think it's an unbelievable story. With the humility he carries himself with, his interviews after games you couldn't script any better. He's a bright kid. It's an incredible story.

""I think about football with Kurt Warner. He was bagging groceries and the next thing you know, he's the MVP of the Super Bowl. It's a great thing to me that you can still have stories like that.""

Howard the buzz of All-Star weekend

Carmelo Anthony's future was the topic of conversation during All-Star Weekend last year. This time, the biggest thing involving Anthony is whether he and Lin can play together.

Dwight Howard is Anthony one year later. Howard's future is a main subject while All-Star weekend is in his current home of Orlando.

""I'm glad it's not me anymore,"" Anthony said.

Anthony was traded to the Knicks the day after the All-Star Game. Howard probably won't be moved until right around the March 15 trade deadline, if at all.

The Magic is weighing whether to play out the season and take its chances in re-signing Howard in July. Orlando can offer him more than any team, a fifth year at roughly $25 million. But it might not be smart to risk losing him without getting something back.

If he signs as a free agent to play with Deron Williams and the Nets in Brooklyn, Howard could make up that money in endorsements.

For now, Howard is with the Magic and trying to make this weekend about the All-Star festivities in Orlando.

""That's the only thing that matters right now,"" he said. ""This is the moment. This is All-Star weekend. We're going to have fun and we're going to enjoy ourselves. All that stuff can go on after All-Star weekend.""

The Nets and Lakers are leading candidates to trade for Howard. The Lakers probably will be among the most active teams heading up to the deadline. The Nets and Mavericks are the favorites for Howard in July.

Midseason awards

NewsDay,"For theater group, creativity isn't an act","Even through concrete walls, reinforced glass windows and double foyer doors, Kene Holliday's voice floods the cold night air around the 100 Black Men building in Hempstead.

Inside, a handful of people in chairs sit in a semicircle. Sitting rigidly in the center is a woman reading from a script she wrote but didn't expect to perform.

Holliday -- who is 62 but still recognizable from his late 1980s role on the once-popular television series ""Matlock"" -- is perched on the balls of his feet and is facing her. He's crouching down, his hands poised like an orchestra conductor. He watches her intently as she reads.

""Come on now,"" he bellows, jerking his body to emphasize each syllable. ""Per-form it.""

The woman in the spotlight, Sharon Jenkins Jones, is a writer and artist who is also in charge of public relations for the growing Moto Theatre Works, an amateur, ensemble-based theater group formed by Holliday in 2009.

The multidisciplinary group, named after Vantile Motojicho Whitfield, a playwright and producer who inspired Holliday, writes and performs workshops of original plays and began performing at churches and benefits last year. The group has about 30 members.

""I didn't write it for myself,"" Jenkins Jones responds. ""I didn't expect to be doing it myself.""

But that doesn't matter to Holliday; the Moto mission is also about creating a cadre of well-balanced individuals.

""It's not just 'Let's put on a show,' "" he said of his company's mission. ""It's about enhancing people's abilities to express themselves.""

Rise and fall

Holliday was raised in Amityville and was a star football player at Copiague High School. He began his acting career in college on stages in Washington, D.C., but he jumped into Hollywood stardom with his roles on the late '70s sitcom ""Carter Country"" and on ""Matlock,"" which co-starred Andy Griffith.

He was young, living in Hollywood for the first time and suddenly had ""instant name recognition from coast to coast,"" he said.

""I came from nothing, and just like that I had everything I could ever dream of,"" he said. ""It was excessive celebration.""

Eventually, his drinking led to a destructive lifestyle, Holliday said. He got clean by his own volition, but the damage had been done. After three seasons on the show, he was fired from ""Matlock"" just three months into his sobriety, he said. He credits the ability to turn his life around to reconnecting with God and his Christian roots, noting that Feb. 2 marked 23 years that he has been sober.

""God allowed me to survive, to live my life,"" Holliday said. ""And the reason I've been able to stay sober is that I easily and veritably admit my own culpability in my deconstruction.""

After ""Matlock,"" Holliday spent the next 10 years filming pilots, focusing on family and traveling the country with a gospel musical group. In 2002, he returned to his hometown to care for his ailing mother and slowly began to see to fruition the idea of a community theater group.

Being a local kid -- known then as Kenneth Holliday -- he started spreading his idea through local artistic and church networks, and word got out quickly that he was building a theater group.

When he held auditions, he did so in three parts: singing, dancing and script reading.

During the last phase, people would mysteriously disappear. It happened over and over. Holliday finally figured it out: They were embarrassed to read out loud.

""The level of education was not there,"" Holliday said. ""These people had gone to school, they had jobs, they had figured out how to get by. But they couldn't get past a certain level of achievement.""

That realization raised the stakes. Holliday took in those he found promising and willing to work hard. He made a rule that everyone would write, everyone would perform, everyone would support one another regardless of ability.

He gave them reading and writing assignments and suggested they purchase dictionaries because he likes to use big words. Things began to change.

Boosting community

Over the past few years, seeing his students grow as artists became secondary to witnessing them grow as people.

They carried themselves with confidence. They began reporting promotions at work, successful job interviews, a better life at home.

""What I'm doing is enhancing our community by enhancing our people,"" Holliday said.

Jerry Harvey, 30, is an aspiring comedian from Amityville who joined the Moto family two years ago. He said Holliday has been a mentor.

""He's a part of people's lives,"" he said. ""He's trying to help us be more than just actors.""

After moving from Georgia seven years ago, Harvey said he spoke with a thick, Southern accent, and as the only minority at his job, it made him self-conscious. He said Holliday helped him refine his speech and pronounce his words more clearly.

""I wouldn't speak in meetings,"" he said. ""Now my confidence is up, and it has helped my work performance.""

A divorce and custody battle left Jenkins Jones, 48, of Baldwin, in a rut. She had never acted before, but said she joined Moto last fall to enhance her artistic side. She credits Holliday with helping her put her career back on track.

She said he saw a talent in her that she had forgotten she had -- both as an artist and in her public relations business.

""He sees it,"" she said. ""And he's rarely wrong about what he sees creatively.""

Performance set

Moto now has three finished pieces members are able to perform, including a series of 10-minute plays focused on HIV/AIDS that the company will perform at 1 p.m. March 3 at Circle of Love Ministry in Copiague. It will be the group's third performance together.

Though Holliday said the Amityville community helped make him who he is today, Long Island is a temporary stop. He hopes to travel more, and would love another shot at a TV series.

""But I'm here now, so I'd like to do something that is profound,"" he said. ""I would like to leave a legacy. I would like people to talk about the poignancy of my theater company and how it impacted this community.""

NewsDay,Immigration OK for gay couple's LI stay,"U.S. immigration officials have granted a rare reprieve to a gay South African national, allowing a Long Island same-sex couple to stay together in their Orient home.

Tim Smulian, 65, can now remain in the United States for a full year rather than having to leave the country and re-enter on a six-month tourist visa. Smulian married Orient resident Edwin Blesch in South Africa in 2007 but visa rules required the couple to live outside the United States for half a year.

Though U.S. citizens may sponsor immigrant spouses, Blesch couldn't sponsor Smulian because the federal government doesn't recognize same-sex marriages.

""We are absolutely thrilled,"" said Smulian, a former HIV and AIDS care counselor. ""We have made a wonderful home here on Long Island and didn't want to really leave, but we had to follow the law.""

Smulian has been a caretaker for Blesch, who is HIV positive, a condition advocates say helped their immigration case. Blesch, a retired English professor, had found it increasingly difficult to obtain medication and access care abroad.

""We have actually always stayed on the right side of the law, but it's been at an enormous cost to health and finances,"" said Blesch, 71. ""I am an active part of my community. I pay my taxes. I have had a wonderful career teaching the youth of Long Island, so I've asked myself, 'Why are they telling me I can't be with the person I want to be with?' ""

Some of New York's congressional delegation -- Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer, and Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton) -- helped the men win a reprieve.

The three have stated their support for equal rights of same-sex couples. Schumer called the reprieve the ""right and humane thing to do"" and Gillibrand stated that ""committed couples deserve access to all the same immigration rights and protections as straight couples.""

Bishop said Congress needed to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and recognize same-sex marriages from New York and other states that permit such unions. ""In a world in which the federal government recognizes the marriage of this couple, our intervention would not have been necessary,"" he said.

The decision was important to equal rights advocates, who helped Smulian and Blesch. But a recent study from the Williams Institute of the University of California at Los Angeles found that as many as 40,000 same-sex couples were barred from filing immigration petitions.

""The reprieve is a fantastic victory for them but it's important to know it's a temporary victory,"" said Steve Ralls, spokesman for Immigration Equality in Washington, D.C. ""There is no permanent option to allow an American citizen to sponsor their same-sex spouse as straight couples do.""",10/02/2012
NewsDay,2 cancer drugs latest to hit black market,"Scam artists have stepped up the smuggling of medicines because of drug shortages in the United States while brazenly counterfeiting others, profiting on people with cancer and other medical conditions.

Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration alerted pharmacies and physicians that questionable versions of two leading cancer drugs had entered the pharmaceutical supply chain.

The breast cancer drug Faslodex and the lymphoma medication Rituxan have recently made their way through unknown sources into U.S. cancer clinics, officials said.

But those pharmaceuticals are just two of a vast array of medications smuggled into the country from foreign pharmacies or counterfeited - made from scratch - in clandestine labs.

""This is the worst possible kind of crime when you think about the patients,"" said James Abberton, pharmacy director at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park.

Counterfeit, stolen and smuggled medicines are a $75 billion global enterprise, according to the World Health Organization, which estimates that one in every four medications sold worldwide is from a questionable source. These drugs have been blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, mostly in Africa, Asia and South America.

Carmen Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, estimates 5 percent of the 4.5 billion prescription medications used in the United States are counterfeits, generally purchased by consumers online.

""That's our best estimate because there's no hard science behind it,"" he said.

Fake medications are becoming an even bigger problem in the wake of ongoing medication shortages caused by production delays and other problems at major pharmaceutical companies, experts and officials said.

""You can't be too careful,"" said Marcelle Levy-Santoro, pharmacy director of Nassau University Medical Center. ""It's like the wild, wild West out there. And [illegal] distributors can get their hands on almost anything.""

Shortages of injectable cancer medications may be inviting ""unscrupulous individuals to introduce unapproved products into the drug supply,"" the FDA said, raising the risk that patients may be exposed to potentially deadly doses.

Nearly 200 medicines, according to FDA statistics, are in short supply and span a wide range, from injectable medications to anesthetics and painkillers.

Thousands of bogus medications are routinely seized at Kennedy Airport, a major point of entry for rogue medications made in China, Pakistan and India, officials said. Questionable medicines of all kinds account for the largest number of items confiscated by federal authorities, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said last week.

To prevent counterfeit medications from reaching the public, pharmacies and others need to know who they are buying from, experts said.

For example, the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Abberton said, only buys medications from known wholesalers that deal directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Working through reputable wholesalers allows the health system to trace each drug's chain of custody from production to delivery, Abberton said.

Levy-Santoro said her center's medication purchases also are made only through major wholesalers.

The FDA learned last month that the two cancer drugs were being peddled directly to physicians via distributors who remain at large.

""The FDA was made aware that clinics were purchasing unapproved medications as a cost-savings measure,"" said agency spokeswoman Shelly Burgess, who did not reveal how the agency found out about the smuggled cancer drugs or where the drugs were sent.

Burgess said tests revealed the cancer drugs are versions approved in other countries and are similar to the FDA-approved medications in this country.

There have been no reports of harm caused by the drugs, the FDA said.

Internet pharmacies' role

The National Crime Prevention Council, which cites counterfeit medications as a growing health threat, reports the most commonly bootlegged medications are aimed at patients with serious or chronic health conditions: high cholesterol, hypertension, HIV infection and cancer. Erectile dysfunction drugs are the most widely counterfeited drugs, experts say.

Skyrocketing medication costs have been driving consumers to search for deals online, according to the council, and attractive pricing is a deceptive lure.

Catizone said about 80 percent of the Internet pharmacies on his pharmacy organization's ""not recommended"" list do not require a valid prescription.

And virtually all of the so-called Canadian pharmacies online, Catizone said, are not licensed to sell drugs in the United States.

""Only two Canadian pharmacies are registered in the United States, and they're registered in Nevada and not in any other state,"" he said. ""So they're operating illegally in the rest of the country because a pharmacy has to be registered in each state that it operates.""

Rep. Steve Israel (D-Dix Hills) is in the process of retooling a measure that strengthens consumer protections against purveyors of bogus medicine. Israel plans to reintroduce his bill during the current session of Congress, spokeswoman Samantha Slater said.

Israel first introduced legislation in 2003 after Tim Fagan, a Dix Hills teenager at the time, nearly died after receiving an injection of the immune-booster Epogen following a liver transplant.

Fagan's parents purchased the medication at a Dix Hills CVS outlet. The altered drug was the product of a Florida counterfeiter who removed the labels of a lower-dose version of Epogen and placed his own on the bottles, claiming it as the higher dose. The medication, which was never maintained at the proper temperature, was then sold back into the supply chain at an elevated price.

The counterfeiter was indicted in 2003 on racketeering charges and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Fake pills seized Today, most of the world's medication traffickers are in China, Pakistan and India, said Tom Kubic, president of the Pharmaceutical Security Institute, a consortium of drug-security officers for major pharmaceutical companies.

The institute investigates reports of fake or foreign medicines that have infiltrated the United States or other countries and works in conjunction with the FDA and customs officials, Kubic said.

""At JFK . . . you see the customs guys working with the FDA inspectors, taking package after package off the line. Most are small quantities of about 90 tablets,"" Kubic said.

In 2010, the most recent year for complete statistics, Kubic's organization investigated 2,054 cases of stolen, counterfeited and diverted medications worldwide involving 593 specific types of medicine. Diverted medications, he said, are genuine pharmaceutical products approved and intended for sale in one country, but illegally intercepted and sold in another.

Last year, customs agents found 20,000 counterfeit erectile dysfunction pills at Kennedy in cargo from Hong Kong, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol report. The shipment, valued at $220,000, contained fake Viagra, Cialis and Levitra. ""Counterfeiters generally do not want to kill their customers,"" Kubic said. ""Whether these customers get better, they don't care.""

Some bogus medications have seriously sickened unwitting patients. A Texas emergency room doctor last year suffered a stroke after taking a counterfeit version of the popular over-the-counter weight-loss drug Alli. The doctor bought the fake drug on eBay.

The counterfeit, according to the FDA, contained sibutramine, a compound legally found in other types of weight-loss medicines but included at three times the usual daily dosage. The genuine product contains no sibutramine.

FDA investigators last year also reported fake versions of drugs for insomnia, depression and anxiety. The bootlegged Ambien, Xanax, Lexapro and Ativan all contained the potent antipsychotic drug Haldol, which caused people to suffer serious breathing problems.

""Fake drugs are often made in unsanitary conditions. They can contain lead or talc or rat poison,"" said Dr. Jed Kaminetsky, a urologist at NYU Medical Center. He now warns his patients about fake erectile dysfunction drugs after some of them bought bogus pills online.

Kaminetsky spares no details. ""A lab can be anything,"" he said, ""a filthy kitchen or somebody's bathroom.""

Tips to prevent buying counterfeit medications

Tell your doctor if you're undergoing cancer therapy outside a major cancer center, and make certain your physician knows the provenance of the medications being administered.

Online buyer beware: Avoid online pharmacies that sell medications without a prescription. These operations are major sources of bogus medications

Look for the seal: Trust online pharmacies that carry the VIPP seal for Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice site, certification they have been accredited by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy

Get a listing: Consult the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy website for a list of accredited online pharmacies at www.nabp.net

Other signs: If using an online pharmacy, also make sure it has a legitimate street address and is registered in New York to dispense medications in the state.

NewsDay,Paranoia runs deep in 'The Fear Index' by Robert Harris,"THE FEAR INDEX, by Robert Harris. Alfred A. Knopf, 285 pp., $25.95.

Let it never again be said that high finance is boring. With a satirist's eye for detail and a note-perfect instinct for pacing, Robert Harris brings the Geneva banking scene to ominous life in his twisty new thriller ""The Fear Index,"" its virtues somewhat mitigated by the problem that, within about 10 pages, the identity of the villain will no longer be a mystery to most readers, though it remains hidden from the main characters until the last few chapters.

This doesn't seem to be the way Harris has planned it, but even the jacket copy manages to give away most of the game. It's hard to come up with a synopsis that doesn't at least hint loudly at the story's resolution, so I'm not going to try. Harris' hero is Alex Hoffmann, a hedge-fund manager with a background in what he calls ""machine reasoning"" -- artificial intelligence -- who has created an algorithm that predicts the behavior of the markets and automatically trades online; it makes billions upon billions for the indifferent Hoffmann and his greedy partner, Hugo Quarry.

Quarry, by the way, is a little masterpiece of banking industry satire all by himself. ""He had a first in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford,"" writes Harris gleefully, ""an ex-wife and three children safely stowed in a gloomy Lutyens mansion in a drizzled fold of Surrey, and a ski chalet in Chamonix where he went in winter with whoever happened to be his girlfriend that weekend: an interchangeable sequence of clever, beautiful, undernourished females who were always discarded before there was any sign of gynecologists or lawyers.""

The story begins with Hoffmann receiving an expensive Darwin first edition in the mail from a website he doesn't remember patronizing, then going to bed only to find that an intruder has somehow managed to gain entrance to his house, even though only he and a few trusted associates have the security codes. Shortly thereafter, he discovers a bank account in his name that he doesn't remember creating. At this point, if you do not at least suspect what is going on, then perhaps reading mysteries is not for you.

Hoffmann receives a blow to the head during his confrontation with the intruder, prompting Quarry; Hoffmann's wife, Gabrielle; and the investigating officer (an unlikable cop named Leclerc) to worry that his tales of invisible bank accounts and fictional transactions are the result of brain trauma and not conspiracy.

Harris' gift for the paranoid is much of the reason the book is worth reading, along with his enjoyably jaundiced take on the finance world. The hedge fund hires brainiac computer programmers from all over the world regardless of language or social skills, and so ""Hoffmann's payroll occasionally resembled a United Nations conference on Asperger's syndrome""; perhaps the book's best passages describe gatherings of the fund's investors, a spectacularly contemptible hive of ultrawealthy eccentrics whose favorite pastime is whining about taxes they don't actually pay. His characters established, Harris slowly and expertly ratchets up the fear that something truly terrible is about to happen to Hoffmann. When the book's spasms of violence finally start, its fiery conclusion seems foregone.

Action moviemaker Paul Greengrass (who has optioned the novel) is thanked in the acknowledgments; it's easy to see why. The climax of ""The Fear Index"" is so perfectly paced it should be read with a bag of popcorn, and the story's problems -- unexplained plot points; Gabrielle's lack of personality -- fall by the wayside as the pyrotechnics start to bloom. Like the hedge fund around which it revolves, the novel relies too heavily on formula. But like the algorithm that powers the fund, that formula works.

Five brilliant paranoid thrillers

BY SAM THIELMAN, Special to Newsday

UBIK by Philip K. Dick (1969)

Dick's (arguably) best novel tracks security agent Joe Chip, whose employer Glen Runciter has died in an explosion . . . but keeps sending Chip messages from the great beyond. Or does he?

CAUGHT STEALING by Charlie Huston (2004)

Hank Thompson is just trying to take care of his neighbor's dog when the Russian mob starts asking him about money he's never had, and they're not about to fall for the old you've-got-the-wrong-guy dodge.

ROSEMARY'S BABY by Ira Levin (1967)

No, of course your husband isn't trying to secretly impregnate you with the spawn of the devil. Go back to bed.

SHUTTER ISLAND by Dennis Lehane (2003)

Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule investigate one of the strangest missing-persons cases you can imagine: a woman who's gone AWOL from an insane asylum on an island where everyone knows something they're not telling.

THE LAND OF LAUGHS by Jonathan Carroll (1980)

Teacher Thomas Abbey, out to write a biography of his favorite children's author, discovers something so strange in his hero's hometown that there's no way you'll guess it -- unless you read the spoilery jacket copy.

EXCERPT: ""The Fear Index"" by Robert Harris

Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. -- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818)

Dr. Alexander Hoffmann sat by the fire in his study in Geneva, a half-smoked cigar lying cold in the ashtray beside him, an anglepoise lamp pulled low over his shoulder, turning the pages of a first edition of ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals"" by Charles Darwin. The Victorian grandfather clock in the hall was striking midnight but Hoffmann did not hear it. Nor did he notice that the fire was almost out. All his formidable powers of attention were directed onto his book.

He knew it had been published in London in 1872 by John Murray & Co. in an edition of seven thousand copies, printed in two runs. He knew also that the second run had introduced a misprint -- ""htat"" -- on page 208. As the volume in his hands contained no such error, he presumed it must have come from the first run, thus greatly increasing its value. He turned it round and inspected the spine. The binding was in the original green cloth with gilt lettering, the spine ends only slightly frayed. It was what was known in the book trade as ""a fine copy,"" worth perhaps $15,000. He had found it waiting for him when he returned home from his office that evening, as soon as the New York markets had closed, a little after ten o'clock. Yet the strange thing was, even though he collected scientific first editions and had browsed the book online and had in fact been meaning to buy it, he had not actually ordered it.

His immediate thought had been that it must have come from his wife, but she had denied it. He had refused to believe her at first, following her around the kitchen as she set the table, holding out the book for her inspection.

""You're really telling me you didn't buy it for me?""

""Yes, Alex. Sorry. It wasn't me. What can I say? Perhaps you have a secret admirer.""

""You are totally sure about this? It's not our anniversary or anything? I haven't forgotten to give you something?""

""For God's sake, I didn't buy it, okay?""

It had come with no message apart from a Dutch bookseller's slip: ""Rosengaarden & Nijenhuise, Antiquarian Scientific & Medical Books. Established 1911. Prinsengracht 227, 1016 HN Amsterdam, The Netherlands."" Hoffmann had pressed the pedal on the waste bin and retrieved the bubble wrap and thick brown paper. The parcel was correctly addressed, with a printed label: ""Dr. Alexander Hoffmann, Villa Clairmont, 79 Chemin de Ruth, 1223 Cologny, Geneva, Switzerland."" It had been dispatched by courier from Amsterdam the previous day.

After they had eaten their supper -- a fish pie and green salad prepared by the housekeeper before she went home -- Gabrielle had stayed in the kitchen to make a few anxious last-minute phone calls about her exhibition the next day, while Hoffmann had retreated to his study clutching the mysterious book. An hour later, when she put her head round the door to tell him she was going up to bed, he was still reading.

She said, ""Try not to be too late, darling. I'll wait up for you.""

He did not reply. She paused in the doorway and considered him for a moment. He still looked young for forty-two, and had always been more handsome than he realised -- a quality she found attractive in a man as well as rare. It was not that he was modest, she had come to realise. On the contrary: he was supremely indifferent to anything that did not engage him intellectually, a trait that had earned him a reputation among her friends for being downright bloody rude -- and she quite liked that as well. His preternaturally boyish American face was bent over the book, his spectacles pushed up and resting on the top of his thick head of light brown hair; catching the firelight, the lenses seemed to flash a warning look back at her. She knew better than to try to interrupt him. She sighed and went upstairs.

Hoffmann had known for years that ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals"" was one of the first books to be published with photographs, but he had never actually seen them before. Monochrome plates depicted Victorian artists' models and inmates of the Surrey Lunatic Asylum in various states of emotion -- grief, despair, joy, defiance, terror -- for this was meant to be a study of Homo sapiens as animal, with an animal's instinctive responses, stripped of the mask of social graces. Born far enough into the age of science to be photographed, their misaligned eyes and skewed teeth nonetheless gave them the look of crafty, superstitious peasants from the Middle Ages. They reminded Hoffmann of a childish nightmare -- of grown-ups from an old-fashioned book of fairy tales who might come and steal you from your bed in the night and carry you off into the woods.

And there was another thing that unsettled him. The bookseller's slip had been inserted into the pages devoted to the emotion of fear, as if the sender specifically intended to draw them to his attention:

The frightened man at first stands like a statue motionless or breathless, or crouches down as if instinctively to escape observation. The heart beats quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks against the ribs. . .

Hoffmann had a habit when he was thinking of cocking his head to one side and gazing into the middle distance, and he did so now. Was this a coincidence? Yes, he reasoned, it must be. On the other hand, the physiological effects of fear were so directly relevant to VIXAL-4, the project he was presently involved in, that it did strike him as peculiarly pointed. And yet VIXAL-4 was highly secret, known only to his research team, and although he took care to pay them well -- $250,000 was the starting salary, with much more on offer in bonuses -- it was surely unlikely any of them would have spent $15,000 on an anonymous gift. One person who certainly could afford it, who knew all about the project and who would have seen the joke of it -- if that was what this was: an expensive joke -- was his business partner, Hugo Quarry, and Hoffmann, without even thinking about the hour, rang him.

NewsDay,"May: With Iran, are sanctions working?","There's pain and then there's pain.

Getting stung by a bee hurts. Having a Doberman sink his teeth into your thigh is a more intense experience.

By the same token, there are sanctions and then there are sanctions.

For years, the sanctions imposed on Iran were an irritation, a not-entirely-convincing message to the regime that one of these days ... Now, new and tougher sanctions are being imposed on Iran -- and they are beginning to bite.

The rial has lost 50 percent of its value since December. Inflation is running more than 20 percent, with some unofficial estimates twice that. Iran's rulers have forfeited more than $60 billion in energy investment and $14 billion in annual oil sales while hundreds of billions of dollars in potential sales of Iranian natural gas have been prevented. Crude-oil production is falling and Iran's central bank is finding it difficult to receive payments for the oil it does export.

The regime is paying more to import gasoline and has had to slash subsidies as a result, reminding Iranians that they don't have the means to refine their own oil into gasoline -- thanks to their rulers' perverse priorities. ""We can't pretend sanctions aren't having an effect,"" Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi said recently.

And no one should pretend there isn't justice in that.

Finally, we are making the theocratic clique that rules Iran pay at least a minimal price for being the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism; for facilitating the killings of hundreds of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Saudi Arabia and Beirut before that; for assassinating Iranian expatriates in Europe and plotting to blow up a restaurant in Washington, D.C.; for illegally developing nuclear weapons; for both inciting and threatening genocide; and for killing, raping and imprisoning -- and otherwise egregiously violating the human rights of -- the Iranian people.

Regarding that last indictment, two examples out of hundreds that could be cited: (1) Yousef Nadarkhani is in prison and facing the death penalty. What did he do to deserve that? He converted to Christianity.

(2) Iran's Supreme Court recently confirmed the death sentence of Saeed Malekpour, an Iranian-born Canadian permanent resident. Of what was he convicted? ""Crimes against Islam"" and ""spreading corruption on Earth."" Decent people do not wear ""blood diamonds."" Why is it more defensible to pump ""blood oil"" into your Volvo? If sanctions achieve nothing more than to make clear that civilized people do not do business as usual with tyrants and, in particular, with storm troopers -- a fair description of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which owns many of the country's major industries and businesses -- then they are worth the effort.

Beyond imposing a price for past and current crimes, is there anything else that sanctions can achieve? By now we know that Iran's rulers will not negotiate in good faith. It is possible -- not probable -- that strong, sustained economic pressure will force Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to consider whether the nuclear-weapons program intended to enhance his power could end up jeopardizing it instead.

More plausibly, sanctions may strengthen the regime's opponents. And sanctions make it much more difficult for Khamenei to use the country's oil wealth to extinguish the still-glowing embers of revolution.

Sanctions -- Congress this week is considering a new round -- should be just one weapon in an arsenal of policies aimed at weakening Iran's fanatical rulers immediately and dislodging them eventually. President Barack Obama should be speaking directly to the Iranian people, telling them that Americans want them to live in freedom and without fear. But those who rule them today cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons -- not by us and not by them.

Such moral support should be matched by material assistance. We can find out what regime opponents need to communicate, organize and mobilize, and we can get it to them. Yes, the regime will accuse the dissidents of being American agents. They already say that, so what's the difference? Finally, there must be no ambiguity about our determination to prevent this regime -- which, a growing body of evidence shows, works hand-in-glove with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups -- from acquiring nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.

There are conflicts and then there are conflicts. Iran's rulers need to understand that if they continue to escalate this conflict, sooner or later they will come to the end of the road. And there they will find not just a hive of bees, but the jaws of a very angry junkyard dog.

NewsDay,Opinion: Some call it 'gendercide',"You'd notice if 160 million women were missing from the U.S. population.

You couldn't help but notice, actually. There aren't that many women in the whole country.

Yet that's how many girls have been lost in Asia to the practice of sex-selective abortion. The crisis is the subject of Mara Hvistendahl's provocative new book, ""Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls and the Consequences of a World Full of Men.""

""Gendercide,"" as it's been called, should worry women. Even in America.

Feminists told us abortion would empower women. Instead, in some places around the globe, abortion disproportionately is used against women. A tsunami of social problems is swelling as a result.

The natural ratio of males to females at birth is 105 to 100. Stats that deviate mean something unnatural is at work -- and what's happening in places like China and India today is anything but natural.

In China, abortion is often a means of compliance with the government's policy of one child per family. Combined with a Chinese cultural preference for boys to carry on a family line, sex-selective abortion has become particularly prevalent.

The result is a ratio of boys to girls that tops 120 to 100, with some provinces of China reporting an unprecedented ratio of 130 to 100.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In India, 112 boys are now born for every 100 girls.

In recent decades, demographers estimate, the continent of Asia has lost approximately 163 million women to sex-selective abortion. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has claimed 25 million lives.

Globally, the ratio by sex already has increased to 107 males for every 100 females because of the sheer scale of the abortion of female babies. Even if the birth ratio normalized immediately, the natural balance would not be restored until 2050.

In addition to the harm for women, gender imbalance prevents men from entering the socially stabilizing institution of marriage. An article in The Economist magazine notes that a rising demand for brides in female-starved communities increasingly is met through coercion and trafficking.

Sex-selective abortion is at work in the United States as well. Until recent negative publicity, ""it was not unusual to find abortionists advertising the availability of sex-selective abortions in newspapers,"" Steven W. Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, testified at a congressional hearing in December.

In a 2008 study, Columbia University researchers found that among children born in America to Chinese, Korean and Indian parents, a first-born girl tends to skew the sex ratio of the second or third birth. For second births the male-female ratio was 117 to 100, the report said, and for third births 151 to 100 if the couple already had two girls.

As technology plays a larger role in reproduction, parents can choose whether to carry a child to term based on sex or other genetic characteristics. That leads to Hvistendahl's grim conclusion: ""In China and California alike, mothers have become their own eugenicists."" Hvistendahl tells how Asia's gender imbalance was fueled in part by Western pressure for government population control, which allowed an existing cultural preference for boys to evolve into deadly discrimination.

But feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women and NARAL Pro-Choice America have yet to join the call to outlaw sex-selective abortion. Rather than show solidarity with their daughters and sisters in life, they swear allegiance to unrestricted access to abortion -- even when it decimates females.

The irony is extremely bitter: ""In a world in which women are unnaturally scarce,"" the pro-choice Hvistendahl writes, ""the right to abort will be the least of our worries."" Despite the author's candor, most pro-choice advocates ignore abortion's role in decreasing the number of women and instead blame gender bias.

""Son preference is a symptom of deeply rooted social biases and stereotypes about gender,"" a representative of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum said in congressional testimony. ""Gender inequity cannot be solved by banning abortion."" Jonathan V. Last, who writes about cultural and political issues, begs to differ. The choice is clear, he argued last summer in the Wall Street Journal.

""Restrict abortion,"" Last wrote, ""or accept the slaughter of millions of baby girls and the calamities that are likely to come with it."" If there is equality between women and men, it's rooted in our nature and purpose as human beings. Denying that fundamental dignity inherent in all human life destroys the very basis of equality.

After that, on what basis can feminists advance gender equity? They can't have it both ways.

NewsDay,India reports new tuberculosis strain resistant to all drugs,"Indian doctors have reported the country's first cases of ""totally drug-resistant tuberculosis,"" a long-feared and virtually untreatable form of the killer lung disease.

It's not the first time highly resistant cases like this have been seen. Since 2003, patients have been documented in Italy and Iran. It has mostly been limited to impoverished areas, and has not spread widely. But experts believe there could be many undocumented cases.

No one expects the Indian TB strains to rapidly spread elsewhere. The airborne disease is mainly transmitted through close personal contact and isn't nearly as contagious as the flu. Indeed, most of the cases of this kind of TB were not from person-to-person infection but were mutations that occurred in poorly treated patients.

What's more, there's a debate within the public health community about whether to even label TB infections as totally drug resistant. The World Health Organization hasn't accepted the term and still considers the cases to be what's now called extensively drug-resistant TB, or XDR. However, Dr. Paul Nunn, a coordinator at the WHO's Stop TB Department in Geneva, said there is ample proof that these virtually untreatable cases do exist.

The Indian hospital that saw the initial cases tested a dozen medicines and none of them worked, a pretty comprehensive assessment. A TB expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they do appear to be totally resistant to available drugs.

""It is concerning,"" said Dr. Kenneth Castro, director of the CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination. ""Anytime we see something like this, we better get on top of it before it becomes a more widespread problem.""

Ordinary TB is easily cured by taking antibiotics for six to nine months. However, if that treatment is interrupted or the dose is cut down, the stubborn bacteria battle back and mutate into a tougher strain that can no longer be killed by standard drugs. The disease becomes harder and more expensive to treat.

In India, doctors in Mumbai have reported a total of 12 patients who failed initial treatment and also didn't respond to the medicines tried next over an average of two to three years. Three have died. None of the others have been successfully treated.

The doctors detailed the first four cases in a letter to a U.S. medical journal last month, blaming private doctors for prescribing inappropriate drug plans that sparked greater resistance in three of those four patients.

""These three patients had received erratic, unsupervised second-line drugs, added individually and often in incorrect doses, from multiple private practitioners,"" wrote the doctors from P.D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Center in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

One of the doctors, Zarir Udwadia, in a phone interview, said there is little hope for the surviving nine patients, all poor slum dwellers living in the community. He said he has detected one case of a mother passing the strain to a daughter living in close quarters. One of the patients was also infected with HIV, which typically results in faster death.

Udwadia criticized the testing and treatment methods of the Indian government's TB program, which he says forces patients to turn to private doctors, many of whom do not understand how to properly treat TB or the risks of increasing drug resistance by prescribing the wrong drugs.

""It was a given that this would happen,"" Udwadia said. ""They have had no help from the Indian TB system. They are the untouchables, so no one is making a fuss. They don't have the power to vocalize. There's going to be more family contacts. It's going to spread for sure.""

India's Health Ministry did not respond to phone calls and written requests for comment Monday and last week.

Dr. Nata Menabde, WHO's representative in India, said a team of national experts started investigating the cases Monday. She said the government is also working to improve laboratory diagnostics to help find more drug-resistant cases, and discussions are ongoing to identify ways to regulate TB treatment in the private sector.

""Now there is a high urgency attached to these findings even though the knowledge about the existence of such cases is not new,"" she said. ""The political momentum is right because it has attracted the top level of attention, given the seriousness of the matter.""

Similar highly resistant cases have been noted before. In 2003, two Italian women died and there were 15 cases reported from Iran in 2009. That same year, The Associated Press reported on a case of a Peruvian teenager who was infected at home but diagnosed while visiting Florida. He was successfully treated for a year and a half with experimental high doses of medicines not typically used for TB, costing about $500,000.

Those resources are unthinkable in the developing world, where TB remains a menacing killer and where few hospitals can perform tests to find out which antibiotics might work.

""For there to be another report coming out from India is no surprise at all. Indeed, in a sense, it's surprising it's taken so long,"" said WHO's Nunn. This is ""yet another alarm call for countries and others engaged in TB control to do their jobs properly.""

Tuberculosis is an age-old scourge that lies dormant in an estimated 1 in 3 people. About 10 percent of those people eventually develop active TB, which kills roughly 2 million a year, according to WHO. Each victim infects an average of 10 to 15 others every year, typically through sneezing or coughing.

If a TB case is found to be resistant to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, the patient is classified as having multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR). An even worse classification of TB — one the WHO accepts — is extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR), a form of the disease that was first reported in 2006 and is virtually resistant to all drugs.

An estimated 20 percent of the world's multi-drug-resistant cases are found in India, which is home to a quarter of all types of tuberculosis cases worldwide.",16/01/2012
NewsDay,Giants-Packers: The Bottom Five,"The Giants are heading to Green Bay. The outpost of the NFL. The city that time forgot. City? Well, if you’ve ever been there you know it’s more like a suburb … without the urb.

The last time the Giants played there they were stranded in Appleton, Wisconsin for an extra day because of a blizzard, not there but here. And an extra day in Appleton, Wisconsin is exactly what it sounds like it would be. So the team has had enough of the casserole and cheese culture for a while. They’ll want to get in and out as quickly and efficiently as possible.

But first they have to play Sunday’s NFC Divisional Playoff Game. There are lots of keys to the game that will be and have been dissected elsewhere on this site and others. The Giants need to figure out how to stop Aaron Rodgers, who has 8 TD passes in the last two games against them. They need to play keepaway from the inteception-happy Packers secondary. They need to adjust to the weather at Lambeau Field (even though as I write this it is expected to be colder in East Rutherford than in Green Bay when the game starts).

But you can go anywhere for those important keys and lists of the significant game-tippers. Here we go to the end of the list to delve into the last few middling details on the gameplan and make you aware of everything that is going on. So here, as we do every week, is our list of the Bottom Five Things to Look For:

5. To prove to the world – and to B.J. Raji – just how tough they are, the Giants offensive linemen not only decide to play the gave sleeveless, they play the game pantsless.

4. David Carr gets his first start of the season as Eli Manning stays at home to broken peace over the cancellation of the Hoboken St. Patrick’s Day Parade.

3. Ahmad Bradshaw runs for 79 yards and a touchdown despite suffering from constipation; diarrhea; headache; increased cough; indigestion; joint pain; leg or back cramps; mild dizziness or fast heartbeat; minor bruising, itching, pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site; nausea; runny nose; sore throat; weakness; severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); blurred vision; chest pain; depression; fainting; and tooth problems. All are possible side effects of Forteo, the medicine he is taking to help his foot.

2. Brian Cashman apologizes, says he’s just so used to having the Giants’ season end in early January and that he would never have made those backpage-stealing moves had he realized that football season was still going on.

NewsDay,LI 'AIDS Ambassador' Dale Edmonston dies,"Long Island's ""AIDS Ambassador,"" Dale Anthony Edmonston, died New Year's Day from Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related form of cancer, at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. He was 48 and lived in Rockville Centre.

Edmonston, who had personally fought the disease for 27 years, also battled it on behalf of others carrying the devastating stigma and loneliness of living with HIV/AIDS.

He had advised Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush on the challenges of the disease and had worked with international leaders and national, state and local politicians, as well as celebrities and grassroots activists to prevent the virus from spreading and help those with it.

""Dale personally created safe houses and food pantries for those with HIV/AIDS, making sure individuals, especially children, had shelter, food and Christmas gifts,"" said his sister, Cherie Edmonston-Hardwick, the wife of Freeport Mayor Andrew Hardwick.

""Dale worked hard to help people right here in Hempstead, and I tried to help him whenever I could,"" said Perry Pettus, a trustee in the Village of Hempstead, where Edmonston opened an HIV/AIDS community resource center in 2000 that closed a couple of years ago for lack of funding.

Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said Edmonston's ""hard work and dedication to better the lives of those living with AIDS is a true testament to Dale's character.""

Edmonston released a self-published autobiography in 2008 titled ""A Look Through My Eyes: An Extraordinary and Painful Journey Living With AIDS."" In it, he revealed a suicide attempt that left him in a coma for seven days.

In 1994 he launched a radio show, ""Tough Talk Media: Sounding the Trumpet About HIV/AIDS."" He also had a ""Tough Talk"" TV program, the last show of which is set to air at 10 a.m. Thursday on Cablevision Channel 115.

In 2005, Edmonston, a Republican, lost a bid to oust Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport) from the county legislature. He said he was running because, among other things, the then-Democratic majority was ""unresponsive to local people with AIDS.""

Besides his sister, survivors include his mother, Delores Edmonston of Rockville Centre; and a brother, the Rev. Kent Michael Edmonston of Oyster Bay.

A wake is planned from 4 to 7 p.m. Sunday at Zion Cathedral Church of God In Christ in Freeport. A service will immediately follow. Burial will be at 9 a.m. Monday at Greenfield Cemetery in Uniondale.

NewsDay,'Feasts for Beasts' at LI Children's Museum,"An old-fashioned diner -- with a red-and-tan checkered floor, counter service and vintage glass sugar canisters -- has opened for business at the Long Island Children's Museum in Garden City. And it has some very unusual patrons.

A towering black bear, a raccoon, a beaver, a boa constrictor and a leopard all wait to be fed. Visiting kids become waiters, offering each animal the meal they've learned that the animal likes to eat. Offer the wrong menu item -- choices include fish, pig, mouse, acorn, frog and ant -- and the sugar canister lights up ""NO."" Get it right, and see a ""YES.""

The Animal Diner is the centerpiece of ""Feasts for Beasts,"" the first new permanent indoor exhibit added since the Children's Museum opened on Museum Row 10 years ago. During the grand opening this weekend, in addition to its regular features, the exhibit will offer animal face painting, and kids can make a Critter Chomper mask craft.

While the animals at the diner counters are fake, ""Feasts for Beasts"" also includes live insects and animals such as bees in a working hive, a bearded dragon named Yoshi, Franklin the box turtle, a tarantula and a python.

""My son was really into all the live animals,"" says Mei Chiu of New Hyde Park. Jonathan, 5, a kindergartner, got a sneak peek of the exhibit last weekend. ""Every time the handler was showing one of the new animals, he was right in front of the table.""

HANDS-ON LEARNING

The exhibit teaches kids about herbivores, which eat plants; carnivores, which eat meat; and omnivores, which eat both. Almost every aspect of the exhibit is hands-on -- kids will open doors, pull levers, turn cranks, spin wheels. ""The way they had it visually displayed made it come much more alive for my kids,"" says Annemarie Hill-Hotz of Wantagh, who was at the sneak preview with son Sean, 5, and daughter Mairead, 2. ""They had to think for themselves; they had to self-correct, which was good.""

Kids turn a crank and see how the jaw of a lion opens vertically. Turn another crank and see how a zebra's jaw rotates sideways to chew. They learn that plant eaters tend to have flat-top incisors, while meat eaters have sharp, chiseled teeth. They learn that some whales have fringed plates called baleens instead of teeth -- and see a life-size example of the chomper that seems like it has a mane of hair. ""A whale takes a huge gulp of seawater into its mouth and pushes the water back out through the baleen filter,"" the exhibit explains. ""It then licks off and eats the small sea animals that have gotten caught on the baleen.""

Port Washington filmmaker Alan Teitel produced a slow-motion video of the mouths of a butterfly, a cockroach and a housefly as the insects capture and consume their food. A display called ""Accidental Meals"" shows an X-ray of a dog from Lynbrook that ate 22 pacifiers; the boxer, Mylo, had to have them surgically removed by a veterinarian.

The beehive will have a couch in front of it so visitors can sit and watch the activity. The bees fly in and out of the hive through an access tube leading out the museum's second floor; the hive was relocated from Lynbrook. ""The colony was saved from a tree that was blown to pieces by Hurricane Irene,"" says Maureen Mangan, director of museum communications.

TRY A CRICKET

Still other displays teach how birds, which don't have teeth, eat their meals. It explains how short, strong beaks crack hard food; wide, flat beaks scoop up food in the water; and sharp, hooked beaks grab meat and tear it. Roll a slot-machine type wheel and see how animals such as chameleons use their tongues to catch moving prey. Once the exhibit gets rolling and the animals get on a regular feeding schedule, the museum will alert visitors to feeding times so they can watch animal curator Christina Kenny feed the creatures.

Visitors can even buy their own snack of sour-cream-and-onion-flavored crickets, Cheddar-cheese-flavored worms or a lollipop with an edible scorpion in the center from a vending machine that charges $2 or $3 per item. ""Eighty percent of the world's population has insects in their daily diet,"" says Erik Schurink, the museum's director of exhibits.

NewsDay,Advocates: More gay-friendly senior housing needed,"PHILADELPHIA - At age 62, Donald Carter knows his arthritis and other age-related infirmities will not allow him to live indefinitely in his third-floor walk-up apartment in Philadelphia.

But as a low-income renter, Carter has limited options. And as a gay black man, he's concerned his choice of senior living facilities might be narrowed further by the possibility of intolerant residents or staff members.

""The system as it stands is not very accommodating,"" Carter said. ""I don't really want to see any kind of negative attitude or lack of service because anyone ... is gay or lesbian.""

Many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender seniors fear discrimination, disrespect or worse by health care workers and residents of elder housing facilities, ultimately leading many back into the closet after years of being open, experts say.

That anxiety takes on new significance as the first of the 77 million baby boomers turns 65 this year. At least 1.5 million seniors are gay, a number expected to double by 2030, according to SAGE, the New York-based group Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders.

Recognizing the need, developers in Philadelphia have secured a site and initial funding for what would be one of the nation's few GLBT-friendly affordable housing facilities. They hope to break ground on a 52-unit, $17 million building for seniors in 2013.

Anti-discrimination laws prohibit gay-only housing, but projects can be made GLBT-friendly through marketing and location. And while private retirement facilities targeted at the gay community exist, such residences are often out of reach for all but the wealthiest seniors.

Census figures released this month indicate about 49 percent of Americans over 65 could be considered poor or low-income.

Gays are also less likely to have biological family to help out with informal caregiving, either through estrangement or being childless, making them more dependent on outside services. And that makes them more vulnerable, SAGE executive director Michael Adams said.

""They cannot at all assume that they will be treated well or given the welcome mat,"" he said.

Cities including San Francisco and Chicago also have projects on the drawing board. But the first and, so far, only affordable housing complex for gay elders to be built in the United States is Triangle Square-Hollywood in Los Angeles.

Open since 2007, the $22 million facility has 104 units available to any low-income senior 62 and over, gay or straight, according to executive director Mark Supper. Residents pay monthly rent on a sliding scale, from about $200 to $800, depending on their income. About 35 units are set aside for seniors with HIV/AIDS and for those at risk of becoming homeless, Supper said.

The Triangle's population is about 90 percent GLBT and it has a waiting list of about 200 people. The project's developer, Gay & Lesbian Elder Housing, plans to build a second facility in Southern California in the next 18 months, Supper said.

But what took so long for the need to recognized? Chris Bartlett, executive director of the GLBT William Way Center in Philadelphia, noted that advocates spent the better part of two decades devoting their energy to programs for those affected by HIV or AIDS, which were decimating the gay community.

While AIDS remains a priority, Bartlett said, the crisis mentality has passed and allowed the community to focus on other things. He said he looks forward to the Way Center providing social services at the planned Philadelphia senior housing facility, in a sense repaying those who led the gay liberation movement.

""Don't we owe it to them ... to ensure that they have an experience as elders that's worthy of what they gave to our community?"" Bartlett said.

The Philadelphia group has been trying to get its project off the ground for about eight years but has been stymied by location problems, a tough economy and stiff competition for federal housing tax credits.

Rejected once for the credits, developers recently reapplied and hope for a different answer this spring, said Mark Segal, director of the Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld Fund, which is spearheading the project. It's planned for a thriving section of the city affectionately known as the Gayborhood.

""I'm extremely optimistic,"" said Segal, also publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News.

However, Adams said the real solution lies not only in building more facilities, but in cultural competency training for staffers at existing elder programs. The Philadelphia Corporation on Aging, the private nonprofit that serves the city's seniors, began offering such seminars to health care workers a couple of years ago, said Tom Shea, the agency's director of training.

""They're going to be seeing a diverse slice of the aging population in Philadelphia ... and we need to be sensitive to all their needs,"" Shea said.

Adams suggested that discrimination faced by today's GLBT elders could diminish in the decades ahead, since he said opinion research shows that younger generations are less likely to harbor anti-gay biases than older generations.

""So we hope that the passage of time will provide part of the solution,"" he said. ""But of course, today's LGBT elders can't wait for that.""

Jackie Adams, 54, of Philadelphia, said being diagnosed with AIDS many years ago meant she never thought she'd live long enough to need elder housing. But now Adams, who was born male and lives as a female, is part of a local initiative focused on GLBT senior issues.

On a limited income after losing her job as an outreach worker for those with HIV, Adams said affordable, GLBT-friendly senior housing is badly needed. She is not related to Michael Adams.

""I would be incomplete if I had to go from wearing stockings and dresses to (work boots) and jeans,"" Adams said. ""I would like to be able to live in a community where I could fully be me.""",29/12/2011
NewsDay,"Mentally ill, homeless get $400G grant","A Smithtown-based organization that provides housing for mentally ill and homeless residents has been awarded a $414,720 state grant.

In a news release, Options for Community Living said it will use the grant to assist adults with psychiatric disabilities in the group’s supportive housing program. The grant was awarded by the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.

The grant “will provide financial support for Options case managers who provide direct care services and teach daily living skills to residents with mental illness in our long-term supportive housing program,” Options for Community Living executive director Diana Antos Arens said in a statement.

Options for Community Living serves 192 people who live in 64 homes throughout Suffolk County. Case managers visit the homes to assess residents’ health needs and teach skills such as cooking and budgeting so clients can live independently.

NewsDay,Manhattan rapist gets a whopping 428-year sentence,"A rapist who terrorized women aged 23 to 69 from SoHo to Washington Heights in a two-month spree during 2009 was sentenced to 428 years in prison yesterday.

Vincent Heyward, 23, of Manhattan, displayed ""a monstrous pattern of violence against New York women,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.

Vance credited DNA evidence with helping to solve the crime. Heyward was nabbed for the uptown attacks after an alert cop noticed he resembled the sketch and video of the suspect being sought and Heyward agreed to provide a DNA sample. A 34-year-old woman he attacked on Broome Street on Aug. 23, 2009, distracted Heyward by telling him she was HIV positive before punching him in the nose. The blood he left on her building's wall matched DNA evidence in the four sexual assaults in Hamilton Heights, Sugar Hill and Washington Heights.

A jury found Heyward guilty of 35 felonies - including 18 counts of predatory sexual assault and two counts each of first- and second-degree robbery and first-degree burglary - against five different women on Nov. 18.

NewsDay,Unbeatable opponent for Tennessee's Summitt,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - The first thing you notice is how still she is.

Pat Summitt doesn't run down in front of the scorer's table anymore, screaming at officials and manically gesturing at her players to get back on defense.

Her famous steely gaze that struck fear in the hearts of University of Tennessee women's basketball players for 37 years is nowhere to be found, replaced by a blank, unreadable expression.

Occasionally, Summitt will bark out an order the way she used to, but for the most part, she stands almost frozen at the end of the bench, watching the action unfold in front of her.

""She's not as animated. She's more of an observer now,"" said longtime Tennessee assistant coach Mickie DeMoss. ""But that's OK. She's still the same Pat. She still has more courage than anyone I know. The disease hasn't taken that away.""

Shocking announcement

Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The disease is early-onset dementia, Alzheimer's type. In August, Summitt, 59, stunned the sports world when she announced that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and, with the blessing of the school's administration, planned to keep coaching.

Summitt, who has won an Olympic gold medal, eight NCAA championships and 1,075 games entering Sunday's game against DePaul, is the winningest coach in college basketball history. Now she is in the middle of a battle she is destined to lose. But she is fighting to redefine the perception of a debilitating and stigmatizing disease.

According to the Mayo Clinic, Alzheimer's is caused by the destruction of brain cells. It usually progresses slowly, causing a gradual decline in cognitive abilities and eventually death.

It is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, and an estimated 5.4 million Americans, including more than 55,000 people on Long Island, have been diagnosed with the disease, according to the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association.

When she first went public with her diagnosis, Summitt said she had a grandmother who suffered from ""severe dementia.""

For many of those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers, Summitt's announcement was a seminal moment, much as Magic Johnson's announcement that he was HIV-positive was for AIDS patients in 1991.

Angela Geiger, the chief strategy officer for the Alzheimer's Association, said she and her staff received more phone calls, emails and texts when Summitt revealed her diagnosis than they had for any other news story relating to the disease.

""Her impact is huge,"" Geiger said. ""She's a very public figure that many people admire. The way she announced it was very honest and empowering for other people. It helped destigmafy it. It's only recently that we've had people who are in the early process of this disease come out and talk about it.""

Noticeable changes

Summitt's staff and her close friends began noticing things last season. Normally quick-witted and disciplined, Summitt suddenly was late for practices or would hesitate when calling a play or simply would not get out of bed in the morning.

""She lost her keys three times in a day instead of once,"" said her 21-year-old son, Tyler, a walk-on on the Tennessee men's basketball team. ""She was the one who was always five steps ahead of us. Suddenly she was right there next to us and we knew something was amiss.""

Summitt had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for years, and she thought there might be a problem with her medication. A battery of tests at the Mayo Clinic in the spring, however, revealed she was in the early stages of the irreversible disease.

It was shocking news for a woman who had never met an opponent she didn't think she could beat. In 37 seasons, Summitt had built the Tennessee women's program from one in which she drove the team van and did its laundry to a multimillion-dollar enterprise that drew an average of 12,999 fans per game last season.

She also has managed to have a family, going into labor with Tyler on a 1990 recruiting trip and bringing him to nearly every practice and game after that.

Tyler, who is very close to his divorced mother, is now the point man on her support team. Initially, he was one of the few people who knew of her diagnosis as she went through several months of denial.

""Of course we asked, 'Why is this happening to us?' "" he said. ""It was hard to even think about. Then we talked about it and decided there had to be a higher purpose. My mom has always been about helping people. God is giving her something to do on a higher platform than just the world of basketball.""

Staying on the job

Summitt knew she wanted to keep coaching as long as she could. What she didn't know was how the university, the fans, her players and her coaching staff were going to react to this decision. The Summitts talked to a lawyer and knew that the university had the legal right to immediately remove her from her position. Instead, when they broke the news to chancellor Jimmy Cheek and athletic director Joan Cronan, the two began tearing up and pledged their full support.

""This is uncharted waters for all of us,"" Cronan said. ""But if you're going to be in uncharted waters, wouldn't you want someone like Pat to be the captain of the ship?""

The captain of the ship has had to learn to delegate, which is exactly why the ship is sailing as smoothly as it is heading into Madison Square Garden, where the No. 9 Lady Vols will play No. 20 DePaul in the Maggie Dixon Classic on Sunday.

Summitt's assistants do the heavy lifting now. Associate head coach Holly Warlick runs the huddle and conducts the postgame news conferences. DeMoss helps Summitt with the offense. Dean Lockwood, another longtime assistant, is in charge of the defense along with Warlick.

Summitt is never alone. Her staff is with her during the day. And Tyler, who has an apartment on campus, now spends most of his nights in the family's sprawling riverfront home in Knoxville. He helps her stay sharp by downloading new puzzles and games to her iPad every few days.

Summitt's access to the media is limited. With DeMoss' help, she still does her postgame radio show and issues a written statement after each game. She no longer does one-on-one interviews.

""This program will always be Pat Summitt's basketball program,"" Warlick said. ""I'm just the messenger for her right now. Pat is still coaching games, she's still at practice and she's still very involved in recruiting. We've just tried to lighten the load so she doesn't have to come in the office every day. There's going to be bad days.""

After getting over the initial shock of hearing the diagnosis, her players say not much has changed on the team.

""We were worried about the first practice, and we weren't sure what to expect,"" senior Vicky Baugh said. ""But then she started yelling at us like she always does. It kind of [stunk], but there was also a sigh of relief that she was still Pat, she's still here and she's still our coach.""

She's also still the coach to the thousands of die-hard Lady Volunteer fans who scream when she is introduced at the start of a game as if she were some kind of visiting rock star.

More than 35,000 of them have bought bright orange ""We Back Pat"" T-shirts, the funds of which will go to the newly launched Pat Summitt Foundation. Summitt started the foundation shortly after going public with the goal of raising awareness, providing advocacy and helping fund research for Alzheimer's.

The big question that remains in Knoxville is how much longer Summitt can continue doing all this. DeMoss, who joined Summitt's staff in 1985, believes her friend will know when it's time to go. The Tennessee administration seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach. ""Nobody has a crystal ball,"" Cronan said. ""We're just going to take one day at a time and make the right decision that day.""

Perhaps the most important decision already has been made. By deciding to go public with her situation, Summitt has extended her legacy beyond the basketball court. She's made it easier to talk about something no one was talking about. Said DeMoss: ""I think something great is going to come out of this. It's going to help millions of people.""",10/12/2011
NewsDay,New health commissioner in Nassau,"A Bellmore physician has been named Nassau's new health commissioner, County Executive Edward Mangano announced Wednesday.

Lawrence Eisenstein, 39, who has served as the county health department's deputy commissioner since late 2009, is a specialist in internal medicine and infectious diseases.

He is a graduate of the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara in Mexico and followed that with his required U.S. training at the New York Medical College in Westchester County.

Eisenstein, who had been chief resident in internal medicine and had a fellowship in infectious diseases at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, said his work with HIV/AIDS ""brought me into public health as a whole.

""We are looking to make sure that people are still receiving the services they are entitled to during these difficult economic times,"" he said in an interview.

Mangano said Eisenstein's ""experience, leadership and dedication are key assets"" that will serve to protect and promote the health of county residents.

Eisenstein has served as acting health commissioner since July, following the resignation of Maria Torroella Carney from the $175,000-a-year job.

Eisenstein, who is married and has two children, served as a teaching attending physician at Winthrop from 2007 to 2009 and, at the same time, maintained an academic affiliation with the Stony Brook School of Medicine.

NewsDay,"Hershey school rejects HIV-positive teen, suit says","HARRISBURG, Pa. - A private boarding school connected with the Hershey chocolate company says it was trying to protect other students when it denied admission to a Philadelphia-area teenager because he is HIV-positive.

The AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit on behalf of the unidentified boy in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia on Wednesday, claiming the Milton Hershey School for disadvantaged students violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.

School officials acknowledged that the 13-year-old boy was denied admission because of his medical condition. They said they believed it was necessary to protect the health and safety of the 1,850 others enrolled in the residential institution, which serves children in pre-kindergarten to 12th grade and where students live in homes with 10 to 12 others.

""In order to protect our children in this unique environment, we cannot accommodate the needs of students with chronic communicable diseases that pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others,"" the school said in a statement Wednesday.

Such restrictions are not limited to HIV, school spokeswoman Connie McNamara said Thursday.

Attorney Ronda Goldfein says her client requires no special accommodations. He is an honor-roll student and athlete who controls his HIV with medication that does not affect his school schedule, she said.

""This young man is a motivated, intelligent kid who poses no health risk to other students but is being denied an educational opportunity because of ignorance and fear about HIV and AIDS,"" Goldfein said.

School officials said they were preparing seek a declaratory judgment from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on legal issues surrounding the case when the AIDS Law Project ""took the adversarial action of filing a lawsuit.""

Goldfein said Thursday she was not aware that the school was contemplating such a court filing, but said action is needed because one-third of the school year is already over.

""The sooner we can get this matter resolved and get my student into an appropriate academic setting, the better,"" she said.

Congress amended the Americans with Disabilities Act in 2008 to reaffirm that HIV is a qualified disability entitled to accommodation by public and private schools, a lawyer at the New York City-based Center for HIV Law and Policy said.

Beirne Roose-Snyder, the group's managing attorney, said discrimination against people with HIV remains ""rampant,"" even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said for years that the virus is not transmitted through casual contact. Fewer cases are going to trial, she said.

The school's statement ""shows a real lack of understanding of the real threat of HIV,"" Roose-Snyder said.

Goldfein said the HIV discrimination cases she has seen in recent years usually boil down to one person's word against another.

""The reality is, people don't usually admit it like this,"" she said Thursday.

Founded in 1909 by chocolate maker Milton Hershey, the school educates low-income and socially disadvantaged students for free. It is financed by the Milton Hershey School Trust, which also holds the controlling interest in The Hershey Co.

NewsDay,Obama on AIDS: 'We can beat this disease',"WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama set an ambitious goal Thursday for significantly increasing access to life-saving AIDS drugs for people in the U.S. and around the world, as he announced a renewed American commitment to ending a pandemic that has killed 30 million people.

""We can beat this disease,"" Obama declared, as he announced the new initiatives during a World AIDS Day event in Washington. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton also participated via satellite.

Obama pledged U.S. support to help an additional 2 million people in countries hardest hit by the virus get access to antiretroviral drugs by the end of 2013, and announced plans to boost spending on HIV treatment in the U.S. by $50 million.

""The rate of new infections may be going down elsewhere, but it's not going down here in America,"" he said. ""There are communities in this country being devastated still by this disease. When new infections among young, black, gay men increase by nearly 50 percent in three years, we need to do more to show them that their lives matter.""

As part of Obama's new initiatives, the U.S. will also aim to get antiretroviral drugs to 1.5 million HIV-positive pregnant women to prevent them from passing the virus to their children; distribute more than 1 billion condoms in the developing world in the next two years; and fund 4.7 million voluntary medical male circumcisions in eastern and southern Africa over the next two years. Research shows circumcisions reduce the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission by more than 60 percent.

NewsDay,"License plate renewal, HIV test at DC DMV","WASHINGTON - At one Department of Motor Vehicles' office in the nation's capital, motorists can get a driver's license, temporary tags and something wholly unrelated to the road: a free HIV test.

In a city with one of the highest percentages of residents living with HIV or AIDS, health officials have spent the last year test-driving the HIV screening program. Since the program began last October, more than 5,000 people have been tested at the DMV site and gotten results while they waited.

Now, officials are expanding the program, offering testing for the first time at an office where Washington residents register for food stamps, Medicaid and other government assistance. On Monday, the first day of the program, 60 people got tested, officials said. As an incentive, they're being offered a $5 gift card to a local grocery store.

""You have to meet people where they are,"" explained Sheila Brockington, who oversees HIV testing at the DMV office in southeast Washington, the only one of the city's three DMV service centers where it is offered. ""You're waiting anyway. You might as well.""

The testing project isn't run by the DMV but by a nonprofit group, Family and Medical Counseling Service Inc., which uses an office inside the site. To ensure confidentiality, residents get tested and receive results in the private office, out of earshot of those going about their usual DMV business. The nonprofit got a $250,000 grant to do the testing and secured the support of the city's Health Department and the DMV. Now a second, similar grant is funding expansion.

Government statistics released in June show about 1.1 million Americans were living with the AIDS virus in 2008, and other studies show that about 10 percent to 20 percent of U.S. adults are tested annually. But those involved in HIV/AIDS work recognize that more needs to be done to identify people living with HIV, said Chris Collins, the vice president and director of public policy for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.

""We need to be looking for creative ways to reach people who haven't tested in the past,"" said Collins, who hasn't studied Washington's program but said innovation and creativity by cities is important.

In Washington, not everyone was sold on the idea when it was proposed by the head of the Family and Medical Counseling Service, Angela Wood. She came up with the idea after sitting at a DMV office herself. Initially, some officials doubted many people would test. Now, however, between 25 and 35 people get tested every day at the DMV location. Anyone who agrees gets $7 off their DMV services.

For those who test positive, the nonprofit offers a free ride to its nearby office where they can arrange counseling and an appointment with a doctor. So far, less than 1 percent of those screened have tested positive, though some already knew their status. That's below the city's infection rate of 3 percent.

By now, the four people who run the program at the DMV office have their pitch for testing down. When people are on line, one of the testers approaches with the offer: free tests, money off your bill, and the promise that it won't hurt.

""We don't do blood. We do swabs,"" tester Karen Johnson tells patrons, explaining that the test of their saliva takes 20 minutes and that participants will not lose their place in the DMV line.

For patrons, the offer is generally a surprise, but not an unwelcome one.

Bus driver Nat Jordan, 35, was at the DMV office one day to get his car registered. He said he accepted because he gets tested once a year anyway. Colleen Russell, 28, a newly married nurse who was at the DMV to change her name on her driver's license, said she knew she was negative. But she said she got tested because she comes in contact with patients every day who could be infected.

Not all residents are sure of their status, though. One man who got tested and spoke on the condition that his name not be used said his wife is HIV positive. Though he had had a negative HIV test before, it reassured him to have a second one at the DMV.

Wood, the person who proposed the unconventional testing sites, said she understands they aren't right for everyone. That's fine, she said. The message: ""It's important for you to take the test, whether you take it here or at another site.""

NewsDay,"Dr. John Dowling, ex-Nassau health chief, dies","Dr. John J. Dowling, former Nassau County health commissioner who in the late 1980s helped launch one of the first modern smoking bans in the country, died Monday of complications from pneumonia. He was 90.

Dowling joined the county health department in 1962 as an epidemiologist. Two years later, he received a master's degree in public health from Columbia University. In 1972, he was appointed commissioner, a post he held for 17 years.

During his tenure, the department expanded its public services, including creating a county emergency medical services council and setting up health clinics in medically underserved communities.

Dowling was arguably best known for persuading the county's Board of Health to require smoke-free sections in restaurants and bars -- a widely unpopular move -- more than a decade before New York City outlawed smoking in bars and nightclubs.

""He stuck to his guns and the board backed him,"" said Martin Dawson, 90, former deputy commissioner for administration under Dowling. ""That was the first step in government getting into the anti-smoking business.""

Dowling was born and raised in Pringle, Pa. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where he also attended medical school, graduating in 1947.

From 1950-1952, during the Korean War, he served as an Army surgeon with the 8076th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or M.A.S.H.

When he returned to the United States he began private practice as a general internist in Syosset, where he had lived and worked since 1959.

He also was a professor of medicine at Stony Brook University from 1973 to 1990.

In retirement, Dowling remained active in several health-related issues. He held leadership positions in various groups, including the Visiting Nurse Services of Long Island; Hospice Care Network; HIV Commission of Nassau County; Health and Welfare Council, and the American Cancer Society.

""He didn't get into golf or fishing or anything. Even in retirement, he still pursued public health because it wasn't just a professional career, it was a personal commitment,"" said his son, Dennis Dowling of Huntington, an executive director of ambulatory care services for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.

Dowling is predeceased by his wife of 49 years, Flora. In addition to his son, he is survived by daughter-in-law Lynne; grandchildren Sean and Melissa Dowling of Stamford, Conn., and Kerrie and Peter Stubbs of Princeton, N.J.; and great-grandchildren, Colin Dowling and Caitlin and Connor Stubbs.

A funeral Mass will be held Friday at 9:45 a.m. at St. Edward Confessor Church in Syosset.",03/11/2011
NewsDay,Leonardo DiCaprio stars as J. Edgar,"J. Edgar Hoover, who always dressed for success and was the controversial head of the FBI for almost 50 years, had a symbiotic relationship with cinema: In the days of Prohibition-era gangsterism, he appeared in newsreels to push public support for his brand of bare-knuckle justice. Although he was wary at first, he eventually got behind "" 'G' Men,"" the wildly profitable 1935 James Cagney crime drama that helped popularize the fledgling Federal Bureau of Investigation. And one of his agency's earliest triumphs -- the gunning down of Public Enemy No. 1 John Dillinger -- occurred as America's Most Wanted was leaving a screening of the Clark Gable feature ""Manhattan Melodrama.""

It is highly unlikely, however, that Hoover would have put his imprimatur on ""J. Edgar,"" Clint Eastwood's sure-to-be-contentious biopic, which depicts the late FBI icon in a way that would have had him pulling his hair out -- and probably opening dossiers on Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio and anyone else involved in the film. (The movie opens Wednesday in Manhattan and Nov. 11 on Long Island.)

As portrayed by DiCaprio -- who alternates between a fresh-faced John Edgar of the '20s, and the wizened, Yoda-like Hoover of the '70s -- the subject is a small-minded, venal man, tortured by his closeted homosexuality, driven by a hunger for public admiration, and willing to do virtually anything to maintain his grasp on power, including the blackmailing of presidents.

""Here's this guy,"" Eastwood told an interviewer, ""starting the Bureau of Investigation, which later became the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and then goes on to stay for 48 years through eight presidents. Of course nobody could fire him, because he had something on everybody.""

Hoover's secret file -- shredded after his death, according to the film, by his longtime aide Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) -- was said to contain secrets about virtually everyone in public life, and was used by Hoover not only to maintain his authority but to preserve his biggest secret: Despite several heterosexual flirtations (including a relationship with film star Dorothy Lamour), Hoover was gay. And he and longtime assistant Clyde Tolson were lovers.

""Some people might say [they] were just inseparable pals,"" Eastwood said -- cagily -- to Entertainment Weekly. ""Or maybe it's a love story without being gay, I don't know. But it's very interesting, the way [Dustin] Lance Black] laid out the script. It was nicely written. It didn't go to the obvious.""

'Milk' man

Sign up for Newsday's Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs, TV and more. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The very participation of Black, however, was a dead giveaway regarding the direction ""J. Edgar"" would be headed: An Oscar winner for his ""Milk"" screenplay, the Mormon-raised Black recently premiered ""8,"" his stage drama about the reversal of California's anti-gay-marriage proposition. He's also written episodes of ""Big Love,"" and, back in 2008, wrote the film ""Pedro,"" about the first HIV-positive character on reality TV.

But while agreeing that a gay Hoover presented an intriguing subject, Black said he wasn't interested in ""white-hat/black-hat caricatures.""

""To me that's not truthful,"" he said. ""Even if you loathe the character, you're not learning about them. When I did 'Milk,' I had harsh feelings about Dan White,"" he said, referring to the assassin of San Francisco's gay city supervisor Harvey Milk. ""Of course, I have really harsh feelings toward Hoover. But to de- pict him as solely a villain, to not understand him, makes the film a disservice to your message.""

The movie could, in fact, have been harder on Hoover, agreed actor Armie Hammer, who plays Tolson (and was both Winklevoss twins in last year's ""The Social Network""). ""It's hard to make that call about who these guys were, or what they were, but what I would say is this: Let's say you had a female co-worker and you had lunch and dinner together every day, came to work together, left at the end of the day together. Every morning, every night. People would assume certain things.""

The most sensational aspect of Hoover's purportedly ""aberrant"" behavior was his alleged transvestitism. Eastwood refers to it only once, in a scene following the death of Hoover's beloved mother (Judi Dench). The grieving Edgar puts on one of her dresses, ostensibly to feel closer to her. It's a far more moving moment than it is sensational.

And whether Hoover cross-dressed, of course, is not really Black's main concern. ""Why does a man replace the spot where love and family go with political admiration?"" he asked rhetorically, regarding what many refer to as Hoover's ""marriage"" to the FBI. ""What does that do to a man's soul?"" The conclusion one draws, he said, is precisely why he wanted to tell the story. ""It goes to his sexuality; his inability to love was a result of the times he lived in.""

Unanswered questions

Not everyone is going to go along with the Eastwood-Black version of Hoover's life. Some might react quite angrily to it.

""I'm expecting that,"" said Hammer, whose upcoming films include ""Snow White"" and ""The Lone Ranger."" ""I expect a lot of people not to get with it. Not that it's too smart, but it's very informed, very layered, and you can't passively watch this movie. You have to be on board.""

The whole story is a quandary, he said. ""Hoover does, in fact, build one of the most respected crime-fighting institutions in the world,"" Hammer said. ""There's that conversation. Then there's the idea of repressing who you are. But look at the time period. I'm 25; I don't understand that time at all. I can't understand a world where you can't be who you are.""

""J. Edgar"" may not answer all the questions about Hoover, Hammer added. But it raises the right ones.





The movie file on J. Edgar Hoover

BY JOHN ANDERSON, Special to Newsday

As portrayed in ""J. Edgar,"" the FBI director took some heat from Congress for what was perceived as a self-promotional attitude toward the media early in the history of the FBI. It's kind of hard to deny: Hoover knew the value of publicity in getting public support for his agency.

GANG BUSTERS (1935) -- Advertised as ""the only national program that brings you authentic police case histories,"" this radio adventure program premiered on CBS, later aired on NBC, and had Hoover's approval and cooperation in bringing FBI cases to the American public. It was also the basis for a later series of comic books.

""G"" MEN (1935) -- Hoover approved the script of this James Cagney vehicle and assigned FBI agents to monitor the production for accuracy. The film grossed more than $1 million, which was a huge sum, and included two scenes that were based on fact -- the so-called ""Kansas City Massacre"" of 1933, which involved the death of an FBI agent, and a shootout based on one involving John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson.

THE NEXT OF KIN (1942) Hoover served as narrator of the prologue and epilogue to this wartime propaganda piece, the point of which was, basically, that ""loose lips sink ships.""

THE FBI STORY (1959) -- Hoover -- who appears briefly -- allegedly wouldn't approve of the film, which stars James Stewart, until he'd amassed a file on producer-director Mervyn LeRoy, and even forced LeRoy to reshoot several scenes that he thought were unflattering toward the agency. Two agents were assigned to LeRoy for the duration of shooting.

THE FBI (1965-74) -- ABC's Sunday-night series (""in color!"") starred Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and was sponsored by the Ford Motor Co. Hoover was a consultant to the show but never appeared.",03/11/2011

Fence surrounding

lake to come down

The fence surrounding Great Patchogue Lake will be removed, giving residents an uninterrupted view of the lake for the first time in more than 50 years, officials said Thursday.

Assemb. Dean Murray (R-East Patchogue) and Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri announced the removal of the fence, which is located along a Waverly Avenue spur.

Suffolk County and village officials recently reached an agreement to remove the fence, Murray said in a statement.

Fences were removed around nearby West Lake and Swan Lake in recent years.

""For several years, local residents and members of the Patchogue Chamber of Commerce lobbied for the Patchogue Lake fence to be removed as well, as part of the beautification and revitalization of the village,"" the statement said.

Murray, Pontieri and Suffolk officials will hold a news conference at the lake today at 11:30 a.m. The conference will take place on the southern shore of the lake, opposite Briarcliffe College.

WESTBURY

Meeting to address suspicious activity

The Village of Westbury is holding a special meeting Monday to answer questions and brief residents about a spate of suspicious incidents that have been reported recently.

The meeting will be at 8 p.m. at Village Hall (235 Lincoln Place).

Over the past weeks, residents have reported seeing people knock on doors purportedly to sell items such as window cleaners and driveway sealant. But they appear not to have supplies of what they are selling.

Two vehicles -- a light silver Chevrolet Astro van and a red Toyota pickup -- have been associated with the incidents.

Police said the door knocking could be an attempt to see whether a home is occupied or to case a house.

They have intensified patrols, though no burglaries have been directly related to this reported activity, police said.

In a note to residents, Mayor Peter I. Cavallaro urged residents to be vigilant but not to over-report incidents to police unless suspicious behavior has been witnessed.

Town gets $392K

in storm disaster aid

The Town of North Hempstead has received nearly $392,000 in federal and state disaster assistance funds related to the post-Christmas storm that dumped about 20 inches of snow across Long Island last year.

The state Office of Emergency Management awarded the town nearly $56,000 while the Federal Emergency Management Agency awarded nearly $336,000, town records show.

The winter storm, on Dec. 26 and 27, snarled traffic, stranded Long Island Rail Road passengers and caused numerous delays at area airports. Carle Place, in North Hempstead, saw 18.1 inches of snow.

During cleanup efforts, North Hempstead used 100 employees to spread more than 1,600 tons of sand and salt, and used 80 pieces of equipment, such as sanders and dump trucks, the town said in a statement.

LONG BEACH

Story of hope makes it into new book

Long Beach native Karen Danca-Smith, 37, gave birth to her son, Gavin, in 2007. When he was 4 months old, she and her husband discovered there was something wrong with their son. Every time they touched Gavin's left leg he would scream. Their pediatrician sent them to an orthopedist, and then to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

""We knew, when you are at the 'peds' center at Sloan-Kettering you need to brace yourself. It could be cancer,"" said Danca-Smith, a teacher at Long Beach Catholic Regional School.

Danca-Smith spent much of the two weeks she waited for Gavin's diagnosis in prayer.

""They did a biopsy and found the tumors in his leg were benign, but they had shattered his tibia,"" she said.

The doctors removed the tumors and replaced Gavin's tibia with a cadaver bone that was filled and wrapped with pieces of coral from a reef so the bone would grow as the infant did.

Danca-Smith also co-hosts ""Good News,"" a television show on Telecare, the Diocese of Rockville Centre's television channel. Last year, LeAnn Thieman, one of the authors of the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series, was a guest on the show to talk about the series' upcoming ""Answered Prayers"" edition. Danca-Smith told Thieman her story, then wrote it for Thieman's book. ""Gifts From the Sea"" was published in ""Chicken Soup for the Soul: Answered Prayers,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

""I knew I wanted to write this down,"" Danca-Smith said. ""I want as many people to read it as possible because it's such a hope-filled story.""",20/10/2011
NewsDay,Why Tim Allen's 'Last Man Standing' had 13 million viewers,"""Last Man Standing” is by all objective measures one bad hombre of a show -- lazy, retro, tired and dull. By all objective measures save one: The 13 million who watched.

As usual, the connoisseurs of crow are laughing and demanding that critics have to start eating bird as well.

Which will promptly happen when hell freezes over.

But I have given this some thought and now realize that we -- or at least I -- did overlook one obvious component of the show: the political/cultural one. Tim Allen's character is a ""traditional values” guy who disdains Obamacare (and says so). Women belong at home, and real men should be at work -- preferably manly work and not custodian of some website for crying out loud. When disparities in his worldview present themselves, comedy is born!

I got a letter from a reader today that perfectly captures this. I now share:

Newsday’s Verne Gay's piece on the show "" Last Man Standing"" with Tim Allen is obviously written from the perspective of a bleeding heart liberal with no traditional values or any at all. He starts off with the title ""Last Man” falls flat on his face. WOW! He couldn't be further from the truth.

Next to the Charlie Sheen version of ""Two and a Half Men"" this show is my new favorite. Apparently after the line about Obama Care that was delivered within the first two minutes of the show, he never gave it a chance. Or maybe he did and he's one of those people that are wrong with this country.

""I beg anybody with true American values to watch this show, especially the pilot which is a very funny hour long episode. There was more truth to this show than any other program on television. In regards to Verne Gay's opinion, it is now flat on its face.

Meanwhile, here's what Tim Allen said at the summer press tour when asked his opinion of what he thought a ""manly man” was:

""I think men that tend to their own knitting, as my mom used to call it. I really believe that men need stuff to do. I’ve always thought that. As my mom says, “Devil’s hands are the idle hands,” or “Idle hands are the devil’s hands.” Men need stuff to do. You have to have hobbies, and you should be able to fix stuff.

""I really have always believed that men should do that stuff, and my grandma, my aunt, both said, “There’s nothing more attractive than a guy busy doing something.” You know, time flies, and I like the same thing maybe it’s traditional, but I said — Joy Behar and I got into this on her show, and we know each other. I like women that know how to cook. I don’t know how to cook very well. I like the process of letting a woman take care of you, and it’s either old school or misogynistic, and she said, “Why don’t you just marry Betty Crocker?”

""She got real mad at me, and she took offense to it. I said, “No, there’s the women in my life like cooking. They like cooking for their men.” And the men in my life like futzing around the house and being able to take care of a home and little things. And when men lose this capacity to mortise and tenon with wood, we’re kind of left with nothing to do, like those big drone bees that get kicked out of the hive. You’ve seen them.""",12/10/2011

NewsDay,Greenwich Village leads nabes for highest female gonorrhea rates,"Call it Gonorrhea Village – at least among the fairer sex.

Greenwich Village has seen the highest increase in gonorrhea among females, according to an amNewYork review of the latest city STD data.

From 2008 to 2010, the nabe’s female gonorrhea rate increased a whopping 57%, from 28 per 100,000 to 44 per 100,000. That far exceeds Manhattan’s rate increase of 2.1% in the same period.

Health officials and doctors said it’s difficult to pinpoint why it’s shot up in that particular neighborhood, although testing in general has improved.

“It’s a great thing that we’re capturing more people,” said Dr. David Bell, who practices adolescent medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital. “But the fact remains that people are not well-educated about sexually transmitted infections … besides just HIV.”

Surprisingly, the male gonorrhea rate per 100,000 in Greenwich Village actually declined more than 4% from 2008 to 2010 – the only Manhattan neighborhood to see a drop. (Gramercy Park had the highest rate increase – nearly 45% – in the borough.) Overall, it’s up 19% borough-wide for men.

According to the city Health Department, gonorrhea cases are on the rise, and the same test used to detect chlamydia also picks up gonorrhea as well.

“Since the increases are steeper among males than females, gonorrhea is probably increasing among men who have sex with men, as well as among heterosexual men and women,” health officials said in a statement.

Erica Sackin, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of New York City, said the city’s new mandate to teach sex ed for middle school and high school students, including how to use a condom, could help curb the spread of STDs.

“It’s about awareness. For every New Yorker, this needs to be something that should be talked about,” Sackin said. “If you don’t get tested, you’re not going to know.”

STDs in NYC

• Chlamydia remains the most prevalent of the STDs that must be reported by doctors to the city.

• From 2008 to 2010, East Harlem saw the largest rate increase for female chlamydia rates per 100,000 in Manhattan, a 27.5% jump. Washington Heights ranked first for males, with a nearly 38% increase.

• There are also a significant number of syphilis cases, although they dropped in the first six months of 2011 compared to 2010.

• The city said certain communities can be more susceptible to STD increases because of the size of their at-risk populations and the existing prevalence of STDs. Dr. Bell added that low-income neighborhoods also are likelier to have higher rates because of less access to health care.

NewsDay,'The Dovekeepers': Artifacts and fiction,"THE DOVEKEEPERS, by Alice Hoffman. Scribner, 504 pp., $27.99.

When an author immerses herself for years in a subject, the resulting book is sometimes laborious, stuffed, thickheaded. Sometimes it gets lighter, moving like water through the lives of its readers. ""The Dovekeepers"" is such a book.

When novelist Alice Hoffman first visited Masada, the site of an ancient mountaintop city in Israel, she was drawn to several artifacts: a bit of tartan fabric, some sandals, the hair of a young woman, an amulet and several skeletons. In this place 900 Jews committed mass suicide when the Roman Legion broke down the walls in 74 C.E.; only two women and five children survived, according to Josephus, a first-century Jewish Roman historian.

Over the five years following her visit, Hoffman put flesh on these artifacts; blew life into bits of stories and fragments of historical record. She built a city (walls, hives, underground passages), a landscape (dust, rocky ledges, cypress and desert). She imagined the many signs people used to interpret this landscape -- the religious rituals and myriad superstitions (misshapen clouds, strangely colored water) that infused their lives, explaining and creating fear. She created four women from this landscape and these fears: Yael, Shirah, Revka and Aziza. She followed their lives; put men in their paths, gave them children and grandchildren, gave them the gift and the curse of survival.

It is easy to describe the novel this way, as if a wind has blown through and animated the lives on the page. Yael, blamed for the death of her mother in childbirth, dreams that a lion is eaten whole by a snake: ""I stood barefoot in my dream, on a stretch of rocky earth that was so blindingly white I couldn't open my eyes. I felt compassion for this wild beast, the king of the desert, for in my dreams he had given in to the snake without a fight. He had looked at me, beseeching me, staring into my eyes."" Reading this passage, so rich in symbols, the reader is given a profound insight into Yael's character. How little it takes to pluck us from our modern lives, from our aloof skepticism, and send us scuttling after omens!

The novel is one long darkening sky -- each storm is worse than the last, and no pressure is relieved. Revka watches her precious daughter raped and tortured by Roman soldiers until her daughter begs Revka to kill her. Yael is tormented by guilt for stealing the husband of a gentle woman who dies with her children in the desert. Shirah, the witch of Moab and the powerful healer in Masada, must give her child to the covetous, barren wife of the city's leader. Aziza spends her childhood disguised as a boy, loses her sister, falls in love, learns magic from her mother.

Perhaps it is the historic core that gives ""The Dovekeepers"" its gravitas; perhaps it is the weight of superstition, the familiar need to understand clues and predict the future, even if all you have is a strange recurring dream you never fully understand. All clues seem to lead, at one time or another, to the veneration of life. The doves that all the women care for together are eaten or set free. Revka watches as they ""turned the entire sky white. They rose and disappeared, then returned again, drawn back to their nests. . . . It was an honor to work with creatures who lived in the sky, so close to Adonai.""",29/09/2011

NewsDay,Palestine weighs heavy over Obama's U.N. speech,"President Barack Obama arrived in the city Monday for what may prove to be a contentious two-day visit to the annual U.N. General Assembly, hours after he unveiled his instantly controversial plan to lower the national deficit by $3.6 trillion over the next decade.

Obama was mostly out of sight after his arrival Monday afternoon, holding low-key meetings with staff and later attending a lucrative fundraiser, but his schedule picks up Tuesday as he's scheduled to meet with leaders from Libya, Afghanistan, Turkey and Brazil.

His real test comes Thursday, when he'll try to reassert his diplomatic credentials by addressing the full Assembly. In past years he has been warmly received, but this year he faces a possible rebuff to U.S. leadership as Palestine ups it campaign to gain full statehood – which Obama has said the United States would veto – and questions about whether global economic worries have overshadowed ""soft power"" issues he previously espoused.

Those issues include food security, human rights and treating HIV/AIDS, raising concern among activists about Washington's commitment to international development aid.

""The mood music that came with Obama's office dramatically changed the relationship back to one of partnership,"" said Nancy Soderberg, a former U.S. national security official and diplomat.

Indeed, Obama has much on his plate, as Monday Republicans condemned his deficit proposal, which plans to shrink the national deficit and increase revenue, with more than half of the savings coming from higher taxes on the wealthy and big corporations.

GOP leaders were quick to dismiss it, calling it a political stunt and saying it has little chance at becoming law.

""Veto threats, a massive tax hike, phantom savings, and punting on entitlement reform is not a recipe for economic or job growth,"" said Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell.

John Boehner, speaker of the House of Representatives, said Obama failed to offer a ""serious"" recommendation to the special bipartisan congressional committee tasked with finding at least $1.2 trillion in savings.

""Pitting one group of Americans against another is not leadership,"" Boehner said.

NewsDay,Kate Middleton explores UK charity work,"LONDON - Newly-minted royal Kate Middleton is on the hunt — no, not for foxes but for her own charity gig.

St. James's Palace on Sunday confirmed that Kate — now formally known as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge — is spending the next few months exploring the charitable sector as she mulls what to make of her position at the top of British society. The move shows that Princess Kate is following a family tradition championed by the late Princess Diana, her mother-in-law.

The idea is ""to get to know a number of charitable and other causes better, so she can make well-informed decisions about her future role,"" her spokesman said, declining to elaborate. ""The duchess plans to meet a wide range of people and make private visits.""

He spoke on condition of anonymity, as required by palace policy.

The Sunday Times said the 29-year-old princess had already begun making under-the-radar trips to various unnamed U.K. institutions.

Running or founding charities has long been a favored pastime for Britain's royals. Prince Charles, Kate's father-in-law, is the patron or president of no fewer than 20.

But it was Charles' former wife, Princess Diana, whose hands-on approach set the bar for future royal charity work.

Diana was famously photographed crossing an Angolan minefield, and a 1987 picture of her holding the hand of an AIDS patient helped change public attitudes toward the disease at a time when many wrongly thought that HIV could be spread by touch.

Prince William, Diana's son and Kate's husband, has pulled occasional publicity stunts in the same vein. In 2009, he spent one December night out on the streets near London's Blackfriars bridge with the chief executive of a homelessness charity that his mother used to support, in a bid to raise awareness of the issue.

On a recent visit to California, both William and Kate visited an arts center in Skid Row, where some 4,000 homeless people live in downtown Los Angeles.",19/09/2011
NewsDay,Diane von Furstenberg’s retro glam,"It was a wrap dress that opened Diane von Furstenberg’s afternoon show, which was titled, “Beginnings,” perhaps in acknowledgement of 9/11. But this was not your basic slinky, jersey printed wrap dress. It was pure white cotton, crisp and full-skirted. And so fresh and lovely that it could have been the reason for the show title. Three other white ensembles followed before the color blast began with vibrant swaths of lilac, periwinkle, minty green and violet.



The show meandered – in a pleasant way. There were long shorts worn with neat blazers – almost school boyish, with a touch of geek chic. Models with high bee hive ‘do’s evoked 60’s glam – an embroidered sequin floor-length shirtdress with high leg slits conjured retro Miami or Malibu, while slightly curved shifts with layered hems were glammed up versions of what Marlo Thomas might have worn on “That Girl.”



Prints were zany: giant flowers, leaves and even a giraffe pattern here and there. And coats – like the pale blue nylon job – were utilitarian but meant to be worn with everything.

At the end, von Furstenberg and her creative director Yvan Mispelaere handed out miniature American flags to front-rowers and walked the runway to the song, “Feeling Good.” And everybody did.",11/09/2011
NewsDay,Mayor touts lower Manhattan's comeback,"Minas Polychronakis ran a shop for 25 years in the World Trade Center before the 9/11 terrorist attacks destroyed the towers and his business. In 2003, Minas Shoe Repair opened again, this time on Wall Street.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg Tuesday called Polychronakis ""a 9/11 survivor in every sense of the word,"" citing him as a prime example of lower Manhattan's perseverance.

The district has not only weathered the decade since the attacks, but has also come roaring back with a booming economy and population, Bloomberg said at a breakfast on Wall Street hosted by the Association for a Better New York.

""The rebirth and revival of lower Manhattan will be remembered as one of the greatest comeback stories in American history,"" he said.

Other examples of the area's growth include the Century 21 department store, located across the street from Ground Zero and hoping to expand by three floors; the Hive, a small-business incubator helping entrepreneurs get their ideas off the ground; and the Spruce Street School, newly opened in Frank Gehry's 76-story tower.

The city has since 9/11 invested $260 million in park construction in lower Manhattan, The Associated Press said.

About $30 billion in public and private funds has been invested in capital improvement projects, such as 1 World Trade Center, according to the Downtown Alliance.

The lower Manhattan population has doubled in size since 2001, attracting more new residents than Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia combined, Bloomberg boasted.

So many families call the financial district home that it's been nicknamed the Diaper District, said Leigh Devine, a downtown resident.

Bloomberg said that despite its recovery, the city would never forget 9/11: ""This Sunday, as we reflect back on the past, let us remember not only the agony and anguish of the attacks, but how we channeled our pain into something positive and powerful.""",06/09/2011
NewsDay,Top Doctors: Update on allergy shots,"The allergy shot used to be a weekly ritual for countless kids and plenty of adults, too.

These days, though, weekly shots have become less common as medications have become more effective. But allergy shots continue to be appropriate for some people.

Here's what you should know about them.

1. ALLERGY SHOTS TREAT SOME ALLERGIES, BUT NOT ALL

Allergy shots are designed to treat asthma and nasal allergies, and can be used to treat people who are allergic to bee and wasp stings, said Dr. Daniel Mayer, an allergist and clinical immunologist in Smithtown.

On the other hand, said Dr. Paul Lusman, an allergy specialist in Port Jefferson and an attending physician at St. Charles Hospital, ""We don't usually give shots for skin problems, and nobody should be taking injections for food allergy."" If you're allergic to a food, like peanuts, he said, the best way to prevent problems is to avoid the food.

2. ALLERGY SHOTS ARE DESIGNED TO TREAT MODERATE TO SEVERE SYMPTOMS

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The shots work by helping the body's immune system develop tolerance to irritants so it won't overreact when it encounters, say, pet dander or dust mites.

""They're appropriate if your lifestyle is altered enough -- you aren't happy, and you're suffering, even with medication and trying to avoid things like dust mites and pets,"" Mayer said. With allergy shots, he said, people are ""usually able to come off of most, if not all, of their medicines.""

3. BE PATIENT

Allergy shots may get rid of your symptoms for good, but they take time.

Typically, people begin with weekly shots, and then the injections progressively become less frequent, Lusman said. The process takes quite a long time, however. Mayer said that many people don't begin feeling better until six to 12 months after they begin getting the shots.

""It's a big commitment,"" he said, ""but most people get better, and they seem very satisfied."" In fact, if you stick with the allergy shots for three to five years, he said, there's a good chance that your symptoms will disappear and not return.

4. ALWAYS GET INJECTIONS AT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE

Allergists typically require that people get their shots at a medical office instead of at home, and ""nobody should offer you the possibility of self-injecting,"" Lusman said.

""You should always have a professional give your injection,"" he said. ""Somebody should be available to manage a reaction. It doesn't matter how long you've been on injections; the possibility of reactions is always there. You could have anything from localized swelling to generalized hives to breathing problems, shock and death.""

Lusman said it's extremely rare for someone to die from allergy shots. But people sometimes have reactions like redness, swelling and itching, he said.

5. IF YOU HAVE SEVERE ASTHMA, AN EXPENSIVE SHOT IS AVAILABLE

An injected medication known as omalizumab (Xolair) is available for asthma patients, Lusman said. ""When it works, it is beyond wonderful,"" he said, but the process of giving injections is complicated. And the drug is extremely expensive, at about $1,800 or more for each of the one or two doses required each month, he said. Insurers may pay for it, he said, but only in cases of severe asthma.

How they were picked

Castle Connolly Medical Ltd. is a health care research and information company founded in 1991 by a former medical college board chairman and president to help guide consumers to America's top doctors and hospitals. Castle Connolly's established survey and research process, under the direction of a doctor, involves tens of thousands of doctors and the medical leadership of leading hospitals.

Castle Connolly's team of researchers follows a rigorous screening process to select doctors on national and regional levels. Using mail and telephone surveys, and electronic ballots, they ask physicians and the leadership of top hospitals to identify exceptional doctors.

NewsDay,Is Africa the NBA's final frontier?,"Thirteen summers ago, Patrick Ewing was fighting for the future of his fellow NBA players as the president of the players union during the 1999 lockout.

This weekend, with another NBA lockout in place, his concerns have gone more global. Ewing, now an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic, has joined forces with fellow former Georgetown centers Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo in fighting for the basketball future of a continent.

The trio is leading a contingent visiting South Africa as part of the NBA's ""Basketball Without Borders"" program.

""There's definitely a lot of potential here,"" Ewing said in a phone interview Friday from Johannesburg. ""There's a lot of young talent. Some of it is raw. But with hard work, anything is possible for them.""

Africa may be the game's final frontier. The continent has produced some huge NBA stars, including Hakeem Olajuwon and Mutombo. And now, a new generation of NBA African players is emerging with Sudan's Luol Deng, who averaged 17.4 points a game for the Bulls last season, being joined by two players from the Congo, Serge Ibaka of Oklahoma City and Christian Eyenga of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Still, the number of Africans to make it to the NBA is paltry in terms of potential exports considering that the continent has over 1 billion people.

""There's a lot of potential future Dikembes out there,"" Mourning said. ""But they haven't been taught the fundamentals of the game. And they haven't been taught the skills to promote progress in the game.""

This weekend's event in Johannesburg included 60 of the most talented players in the continent under the age of 18. The players were from 24 countries. Many of the campers have never traveled out of their native countries, and the NBA and its sponsors foot the bill for all their costs. The campers also participate in daily life skills sessions in which NBA legends speak about the importance of education, leadership and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.

Mutombo noted that with there being 600 million people in Africa under the age of 15, it is crucial not to lose that generation, to reach out to the youth and teach them not just about the game but about how to become better citizens and do what they can to better themselves, including getting an education.

Ewing, who was born in Jamaica, agreed.

""We want to let them know that we came from a situation and areas like they did, and made it,"" Ewing said. ""Making it doesn't mean going to the NBA. It can be college. They have to make the most of their opportunity.""",02/09/2011
NewsDay,The Office 2.0: Havens for solo workers,"Call it the home office away from home.

No longer satisfied with lugging a laptop to Starbucks, independent workers in New York are increasingly embracing so-called co-working spaces that offer the comforts and benefits of an office setting.

The phenomenon — an outgrowth of the Great Recession — began as a happy marriage between landlords suddenly left with lots of space to rent out, and workers caught up in job turmoil looking for a shared professional environment to reinvent their careers as freelancers or consultants.

“It forced a new bubble of entrepreneurship that caused everyone to think outside the box. This unprecedented shift created an opportunity for a new way of working,“ said Marissa Feinberg, co-founder of Greenspaces NYC.

Gotham has 14 such shared spaces. “I think we will continue to see this trend grow as the way in which people work continues to change — telecommuting, more working from home and less 9-to-5 office jobs, etc.,” said Daria Siegel, director of Hive at 55.

amNewYork visited five co-working spaces that are leading the way.

***

Greenspaces NYC (pictured above)

Where: 394 Broadway

The angle: For the eco-friendly set

The deal: A full-time desk is $550 a month; open space is $250 a month. They do not have private offices.

Sign up to get the latest updates Get Newsday's Breaking News alerts in your inbox. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Greenspaces NYC provides a home to 80 members who embody a lifestyle of health and sustainability, environmentalist companies, nonprofits and a diverse mix of independents.

You don’t need a green focus to join, but you do have to share their environmental philosophy.

The facility uses Con Ed Wind Energy, kitchen utensils are made from fallen leaves, compost is turned into biofuel, and furniture is recycled and refurbished.

Joe Miller, 24, the founder of Print a Forest, a PC software company that funds reforestation efforts, said Greenspaces was the reason he moved his start-up from Detroit to New York City.

He’s also a fan of Greenspaces’ weekly Idea Bounce Lunches.

“It’s fantastic to be around like-minded individuals coming together to make a change,” he said.

***

Paragraph

Where: 35 W. 14th St.

The angle: For “serious writers only”

The deal: In addition to the $95 initiation fee, membership is $132 per month if you sign up for six, and $152 if you commit to three. A single month is $172. Members have 24/7 access.

Paragraph’s building, a walkup, is reserved for “serious writers only” who like privacy. If a desk, lamp and chair are all you need, then this is the space for you. Just make sure you’ve mastered the art of walking on tiptoe.

Writers can eat, chat and read each other’s work in the communal kitchen, but the writing room, with 38 partitioned desks, must remain dead silent: no cell phones, no conversations, no eating.

Office manager Sara Farrington said coming to Paragraph is “like going on a rightbrain vacation.” Applications are carefully reviewed; you don’t have to be published to be considered, but you must provide references.

Allison Amend, a fiction novelist, found her agent this way. Aside from the “free coffee and candy” she loves that she can transition to the communal kitchen whenever she feels like chatting.

***

In Good Company

Where: 16 W. 23rd St.

The angle: For women only

The deal: $400 annual membership fee; a full-time desk is $750 a month, and 30 hours at a partitioned desk is $150. A desk for a day is $40, and there’s an hourly punch card: $100 for 10 hours.

Amy Abrams and Adelaide Lancaster considered making In Good Company a coed space, but believe women have different needs.

They say the approach emphasizes collaboration among their 300 members (and counting).

“It’s great to be in a community with like-minded women entrepreneurs who are so supportive of each other,” said member Diane O’Connell, founder and director of Write to Sell Your Book, which helps first-time authors get published.

***

WeWork

Where: 1 Little West 12th St.

The angle: For youthful and sophisticated entrepreneurs

The deal: The most expensive of the WeWork locations, offices range from $800 a month for one-person to $3,900 for a six-person space.

WeWork’s third New York location occupies six floors. With 600 members citywide, they cater to the “cool, creative entrepreneurial crowd.” Club promoters find a home here, too, as well as entertainment lawyers and musicians.

Weekly happy hours and monthly rooftop parties are part of their appeal, as are several conference rooms that feature convertible billiards tables. The building is big on being green and boasts floors recycled from old Brooklyn bowling alleys.

Jessica Usenbor, who shares an office with six members of her consulting agency, moved her team over from the SoHo location.

“These aren’t your typical cubicles. Each floor has different character,” she said. “We definitely like the keg floor the best.”

***

Hive at 55

Where: 55 Broad St.

The angle: A fun but professional vibe

The deal: Membership is available month-to-month. Twelve visits a month is $200; full time, $300; and 24/7 access is $450. They offer an off-peak membership, nights and weekends only, for $150 a month, or pay $25 for a day.

Hive at 55 is mainly composed of shared-desk space on a single floor; use of conference rooms is free and unlimited.

Many of the 100 active members belong to small companies. Hive is home to techies, but there are lawyers, accountants, graphic designers and journalists, too. Members often solicit help from one another.

“The open space encourages members to strike up conversation,” said director Daria Siegel.

Rajiv Roopan, who develops educational interactive games, values the face time and advice he gets from lawyers, graphic designers, and software developers. “There’s easy access in our little community,” he said.",17/08/2011
NewsDay,TCA soundbites: Tim Allen,"There's an old saying at the Television Critics press tour, wrapping right about now, that goes something like this: The funnier the panel session, the grimmer the show.

In other words, if the panel is a lot of fun, then -- inversely -- the show is a deadly stew of misfired jokes, bad puns and otherwise dreadful sitcomy schlock.

So what is one of think, then, of Tim Allen's extremely amusing session this morning for ""Last Man Standing?""

A bad sign? Or just an anomaly?

Whatever: Allen worked the crowd, and worked it well, and whether that translates into glowinmg and glorious praise for his his first TV role in 12 years of course remains to be seen.

But all due credit to waking up the press tour, which is pretty much on its knees just before the finish line.

Here are some soundbites from Allen's morning session. He's mostly serious here -- I think -- in talking about his new show, which is about a guy whose life is pretty much run by women. The wonderful Nancy Travis co-stars.

On the offers he got before taking this show:

Oh, there were thousands. (Laughter.) Thousands. I think there were just hundreds. Well, millions, literally, of offers. Every day was an offer. I had an offer office (laughter) . . . really, thank you for that. It’s going to be a long day . . . The other offers . . . it was never oddly enough, it was never the same show. And I said, 'I don’t know why we would not do a version of the same show rather than put me in a legal drama' and there were several of those. What I really like is “Castle.” I like that. I would have done something like that. I think that was it, but that was already done. And there were some shows and I can’t even tell you because it’s too embarrassing, and I’m not going to tell you, although it’s right here. I could, but I’m not going to. They cast a woman in the part they actually looked for me in. There’s one on the air now that I circled, and we read it, and it was really good. But they decided not to, and they cast a woman in it.

On how cheap ABC is now versus the good old profligate days...

Well, what did you guys get from catering today? Let’s start there. How was breakfast? Hmm? (Laughter.) Hmm? (Indicating) look at the size of the Cokes. Hmm? Remember the 12-ounce bottle? It’s a tighter, leaner ship at ABC. That the whole thing, the landscape, as you all know, has changed, between I have probably like all of us 5 ,600 stations. Or, you know, you have that capacity between Hulu and Internet and cable. You have a lot of different choices now, and the network, is free TV, as they still call it, but the landscape is very different. I believe . . . “Home Improvement,” at one point, we were doing 28 share and sometimes we’d get up to 30 share. Like coordinated, it’s 30 million viewers. We could tell the president what to do at that time. We’d call him up, “Try to” . . . just to mess with him, we’d call him, and just, “We don’t like you,” and we’d hang up. But they’d answer. It’s just the landscape has changed. Everything is, I don’t want to say cheaper, but I just did.

There’s less revenue. There’s less of everything. So you got to do better with less. Sometimes leaner is better. In this case, it’s not. I’m just kidding. (Laughter.)

Not a case that it is, but we drink water out of a hose. Let me put it that.

On what his show is about, kind of...

Now, I’m going to get in trouble here because Joy Behar from “The View,” we’ve already had this conversation. (Laughter.)

I think men that tend to their own knitting, as my mom used to call it. I really believe that men need stuff to do. I’ve always thought that. As my mom says, “Devil’s hands are the idle hands,” or “Idle hands are the devil’s hands.” Men need stuff to do. You have to have hobbies, and you should be able to fix stuff. I really have always believed that men should do that stuff, and my grandma, my aunt, both said, “There’s nothing more attractive than a guy busy doing something.” You know, time flies, and I like the same thing maybe it’s traditional, but I said — Joy Behar and I got into this on her show, and we know each other. I like women that know how to cook. I don’t know how to cook very well.

I like the process of letting a woman take care of you, and it’s either old school or misogynistic, and she said, “Why don’t you just marry Betty Crocker?” She got real mad at me, and she took offense to it. I said, “No, there’s the women in my life ... like cooking. They like cooking for their men.” And the men in my life like futzing around the house and being able to take care of a home and little things. And when men lose this capacity to mortise and tenon with wood, we’re kind of left with nothing to do, like those big drone bees that’s get kicked out of the hive. You’ve seen them.",08/08/2011
NewsDay,'Sarah's Key': Holocaust secrets unlocked,"Based on Tatiana de Rosnay's 2007 novel, ""Sarah's Key"" comes tantalizingly close to unconventionality before succumbing to the more routine principles of Holocaust drama. One praiseworthy aspect of the film, not surprisingly, is the performance by Kristin Scott Thomas, who continues her flourishing French film career by playing Julia Jarmond, a magazine journalist exploring the notorious Velodrome d'Hiver roundup (during which French authorities, at the behest of the Nazis, arrested 13,000 Jews and held them in the celebrated bicycle-racing arena before shipping them off to Auschwitz). Julia's research provides a window into the past, which is often far more interesting than Julia.

However: In researching her story, Julia comes across the account of a young girl named Sarah (Mélusine Mayance), who, during the roundup, tried to save her younger brother by locking him in a closet. Julia follows the long-ago story, and she finds an increasingly disturbing connection to her husband and his family, who, naturally, discourage her increasingly obsessive investigation. In the parallel story line, Sarah attempts to escape the Germans, return to Paris and free her brother, who's still trapped in that closet. She thinks.

Where director Gilles Paquet-Brenner goes right is venturing into the legacy of the Holocaust, questions of pan-generational guilt and Julia's personalization of others' victimization -- the subplot involving her pregnancy, and her husband's resistance to it, is a distraction. Where the director goes wrong is via his undernourished action, sentimentalization of sequences involving Sarah and a common enough problem: not knowing when to apply the dramatic brakes regarding the Holocaust. This is not Paquet-Brenner's quandary alone among filmmakers, but it's certainly that of ""Sarah's Key.""",05/08/2011
NewsDay,Insurers to fully cover birth control,"WASHINGTON - A half-century after the advent of the pill, the Obama administration on Monday ushered in a change in women's health care potentially as transformative: coverage of birth control as prevention, with no copays.

Services ranging from breast pumps for new mothers to counseling on domestic violence were also included in the broad expansion of women's preventive care under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.

Since birth control is the most common drug prescribed to women, health plans should make sure it's readily available, said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""Not doing it would be like not covering flu shots,"" she said.

Officials said the women's prevention package will be available Jan. 1, 2013, in most cases, resulting in a slight overall increase in premiums. Tens of millions of women are expected to benefit initially, a number that is likely to grow with time.

At first, some plans may be exempt due to an arcane provision of the health care law known as the ""grandfather"" clause. But those plans could face pressure from their members to include the new coverage.

Sebelius acted after a near-unanimous recommendation last month from a panel of experts at the prestigious Institute of Medicine, which advises the government. Panel chairwoman Linda Rosenstock, dean of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that prevention of unintended pregnancies is essential for the psychological, emotional and physical health of women.

As recently as the 1990s, many health insurance plans didn't even cover birth control. Protests, court cases, and new state laws led to dramatic changes.

Today, almost all plans cover prescription contraceptives with varying copays. A government study last summer found that birth control use is virtually universal in the United States. Still, about half of all pregnancies are unplanned, many among women on some form of contraception who forget to take the drug. Preventing unwanted pregnancies is only one goal of the new requirement.

In a nod to social and religious conservatives, the rules issued yesterday by Sebelius include a provision that would allow religious institutions to opt out of offering birth control coverage. However, many conservatives, saying the conscience clause is insufficient, are supporting legislation by Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) that would codify a range of exceptions to the new health care law on religious and conscience grounds.

WHAT'S COVERED

BIRTH CONTROL. All forms approved by FDA including the pill, intrauterine devices, ""morning-after"" pill and newer forms of long-acting implantable hormonal contraceptives.

SCREENINGS. At least one annual ""well-woman"" preventive-care visit, screening for the virus that causes cervical cancer for women 30 and older, annual HIV counseling and screening, annual STD counseling, domestic violence counseling.

PREGNANCY SUPPORT. Prenatal screening for diabetes, support for breast-feeding mothers.

EXCEPTIONS. Copays may be charged for brands for which a generic is available.",01/08/2011
NewsDay,"Chillingo: Puzzles, platforming — zombies?","Developers Chillingo and EA recently rolled out their newest line of mobile games for the iPad, iPhone and iTouch, and there happened to be some interesting titles among the pack. Here’s a little something on each one, along with my initial impressions:

Rope Rescue

Rope Rescue is a puzzle game that may seem similar to fans of Angry Birds. Players use their bird to string together a set of moving wheels in order to rescue a fellow bird from captivity. While some may dismiss the game as an Angry Birds knockoff, Rope Rescue has some genuinely creative levels that are sure to interest puzzle game fans when it releases.

Nyx’s Quest

Nyx’s Quest is a Greek mythology themed platformer in which players use the power of the iPad’s touch-screen to manipulate objects in the environment to make them navigable for Nyx, the game’s heroine. Aside from the interesting touch-screen mechanic and colorful cell-shaded graphics, there wasn’t much separating Nyx’s Quest from the dozens of other platformers available on the iPad.

Pollen Count

The first thing I noticed about Pollen Count was the gorgeous backgrounds that are displayed for each level. I’ve never seen an iPad game look this good, and it’s definitely clear that developer Chillingo put a lot of effort into making this game look good. The gameplay itself is mostly uninteresting, with players drawing lines from bees to flowers in order to get them to collect pollen.

However, the game does make up for its so-so gameplay with additional modes such as a flying mode that uses the iPad’s tilt controls, as well as a bonus “Zombee” mode, in which players have to avoid zombie bees that try to infect your hive. The game also offers two-player co-op on a single iPad, which is a nice inclusion. Pollen count might be worth your time for the sheer amount of content it offers- and if you get bored of the gameplay, you can always just stare at the gorgeous backgrounds.

Dream Track Nation

Players of Line Rider will instantly recognize this game for its wacky vehicle physics and cartoonish graphics. Players steer their driver through a series of ridiculous gravity-defying stages in order to reach the finish line. By tilting the iPad left and right, players control the angle and positioning of their vehicle as they speed through increasingly strange courses. I found this game to be fun, and would even consider picking it up for myself.",27/07/2011
NewsDay,Drug prices may plummet as patents expire,"The cost of several prescription medicines used daily by millions of people should plummet over the next year or so.

The next 14 months will bring generic versions of seven of the world's 20 best-selling drugs, including the top two: cholesterol fighter Lipitor and blood thinner Plavix.

The magnitude of this wave of expiring drugs patents is unprecedented. Between now and 2016, blockbusters with about $255 billion in global annual sales are set to go off patent, notes EvaluatePharma Ltd., a London research firm.

Generic competition, which typically costs 20 percent to 80 percent less, will then decimate sales of the brand-name drugs and slash the cost to patients and companies that provide health benefits.

Top drugs getting generic competition by September 2012 include: Lipitor, taken daily by about 4.3 million Americans, and Plavix, by 1.4 million. Generic versions of big-selling drugs for blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, depression, high triglycerides, HIV and bipolar disorder also are coming by then.

The flood of generics will continue for the next decade or so, as about 120 brand-name prescription drugs lose market exclusivity, according to prescription benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc.

""My estimation is at least 15 percent of the population is currently using one of the drugs whose patents will expire in 2011 or 2012,"" says Joel Owerbach, chief pharmacy officer for Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield, which serves most of upstate New York.

Those patients, along with businesses and taxpayers who help pay for prescription drugs through corporate and government prescription plans, collectively will save a small fortune.

NewsDay,"Movie Review: 'Sarah's Key,' -- 2.5 stars","Sarah’s Key

2.5 stars

Directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner

Starring Kristin Scott Thomas, Melusine Mayance, Niels Arestrup, Frederic Pierrot

“Sarah’s Key,” based on the novel by Tatiana de Rosnay, is set during the 1942 Vel d’Hiv roundup in France during which French police deported hundreds of Jews to concentration camps.

When 10-year-old Sarah is forced out of her apartment, she hides her little brother in a locked closet, innocently believing she would be back to release him in no time. As her family gets shepherded from one awful holding pen to another, though, she becomes set on escaping to rescue her brother.

Concurrent with Sarah’s journey is a present-day story about Julia (Kristin Scott Thomas), an investigative journalist who discovers that her apartment once belonged to deported Jews — Sarah’s family, to be specific. As she unearths the blighted history of her apartment, we come closer and closer to learning Sarah’s fate.

Sarah’s tale is so horrific and unimaginable, it’s sometimes difficult to watch. Meanwhile, as Julia grapples with owning a home that once belonged to deported Jews, her delicate circumstances introduce a compelling moral complexity.

Having said that, there’s a manipulative quality to “Sarah’s Key” that undermines the innate power of Sarah’s story. Julia’s personal growth is supposed to feel consequential — something is missing from her life, and her marriage is growing strained — but it all feels artificial. Shoehorning Julia and Sarah into one story might have worked as a book, but it’s not quite as successful on the big screen.",21/07/2011
NewsDay,Letter: Save Suffolk health care centers,"The Elsie Owens Health Center in Coram, and all of the nine Suffolk health centers, must be saved [""Docs: Cuts may spur crisis,"" News, July 13].

For 20 years I worked in that health center and saw the people who benefited from having access to quality, low-cost health care. Lives were saved when medical problems were identified early, and proper treatment could be given to forestall a hospital admission.

Over the years, countless residents have used these health centers and have had a place to bring their children for immunizations and pediatric care. They have had a place to go for prenatal care, for the identification and treatment of common medical problems like diabetes, hypertension, HIV and tuberculosis. They have had a place to go for help with emotional problems.

These are not strangers: They are our neighbors, taxpaying residents and some less fortunate. The network of health centers has been the crown jewel of all of the services offered by Suffolk County, in partnership with local hospitals. This is a system that works.

NewsDay,"Drug stops HIV among hetero couples, not just gays","ATLANTA - An AIDS drug already shown to help prevent spread of the virus in gay men also works for heterosexual men and women, two studies in Africa found. Experts called it a breakthrough for the continent that has suffered most from AIDS.

""These studies could help us to reach the tipping point in the HIV epidemic,"" said Michael Sidibe, executive director of the United Nation's AIDS program, in a statement Wednesday as the study results were announced.

""This is really a game changer,"" said Dr. Jared Baeten, the University of Washington researcher who was a leader of one of the studies.

The prevention drug is Truvada, a pill already on pharmacy shelves to treat people with HIV. It's made by Gilead Sciences Inc., based in California. Another Gilead drug, Viread, was also used in one of the two African studies.

Earlier research with Truvada found it prevented spread of HIV to uninfected gay men. But experts were thrilled Wednesday at the first compelling evidence that AIDS medications can prevent infection between men and women. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which gave advice last fall for use of the preventive drugs among gays, is now developing guidance for heterosexuals in this country.

At the same time, national and international health officials said it's far from clear how preventive use of these drugs will play out. How many people would want to take a pill each day to reduce their risk of HIV infection? Would they stick with it? Would they become more sexually reckless?

Another issue: There already is a supply problem. In Africa, 6.6 million people are now on AIDS drugs, but 9 million people who are eligible for the treatment are on a waiting list, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, many state assistance programs that help people access AIDS medications also have waiting lists.

The first of the new studies, run by the CDC, involved more than 1,200 men and women in Botswana. About half took Truvada each day. The other half got a fake pill.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

An analysis of those who were believed to be regularly taking the pills found four of those on Truvada became infected with HIV, compared to 19 on the dummy pill. That means the drug lowered the risk of infection by roughly 78 percent, researchers said.

The second study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and run by the University of Washington. It involved more than 4,700 heterosexual couples in Kenya and Uganda. In each couple, one partner had HIV and the other did not. The uninfected were given either daily placebos or one of the Gilead pills — Truvada or Viread.

The study found 13 HIV infections among those on Truvada, 18 in those on Viread, and 47 of those on dummy pills. So the medications reduced the risk of HIV infection by 62 percent to 73 percent, the researchers said.

""Our results provide clear evidence that this works in heterosexuals,"" said Baeten, who co-chaired the study.

An independent review panel on Sunday said the benefit was clear-cut and stopped handing out placebos, instead offering the preventive drugs. Essentially, they deemed it unethical to withhold the medications from people who had been on placebo, Baeten said.

In both studies, participants also were offered counseling and free condoms, which may help explain the relatively low overall infection rate.

The studies were to be announced at an AIDS conference in Rome next week. But following the recommendation of the review panel to the University of Washington study, both study teams made hasty decisions to release the results.

These are the third and fourth widely reported studies of Gilead's treatments.

The first was announced last year, involving gay men in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand and the United States (San Francisco and Boston). Truvada lowered the chances of infection by 44 percent, and by 73 percent or more among men who took their pills most faithfully.

Experts celebrated. The CDC advised doctors on prescribing the pill along with other prevention services for gay men, based on those encouraging results.

But momentum seemed to stall in April, when an interim analysis of a study of 3,900 women in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa did not show a benefit from Truvada. Scientists can't explain the failure in that study but one theory is that the women did not take the pill as often as they should have, said Dr. Lynn Paxton, who has coordinated the federal agency's HIV prevention research. who coordinates the CDC's research into HIV prevention.

Gilead Sciences is a major producer of AIDS drugs. On Tuesday, United Nations health officials announced the company had agreed to allow Truvada, Viread and two other drugs to be made by generic manufacturers, potentially increasing their availability in poor countries.

That was seen as good news, but something short of a major coup.

""I wouldn't expect an immediate dramatic effect on the generic availability"" of those drugs in Africa, said Tido von Schoen-Angerer, executive director for Doctors Without Borders' campaign for access to essential medicines. The agreement limits the number of additional countries that can produce the drugs, he said.

Officials say they will have to determine how much of the medicine can be produced and how much it will cost, and priorities will have to be set when it comes to who would get the drugs for prevention.

A 30-day supply of Truvada costs about $900 in U.S. pharmacies, and the same amount of Viread costs about $600. Prices charged in developing countries are much lower, but still can be hard to shoulder.

""Countries need to identify which populations could benefit the fastest and at the lowest cost,"" said Cate Hankins, chief scientific adviser at the United Nations' AIDS agency.

""There has to be some soul-searching about the costs of current drugs,"" she added.

Without WHO or UNAIDS guidance on how to roll out the prevention regimens, experts say it's unlikely any countries will take serious steps to do that. UNAIDS said they hoped that guidance would be ready next year.",13/07/2011

NewsDay,Funding loss imperils campus HIV testing,"Free, anonymous HIV testing on a half-dozen Long Island college campuses won't be available when classes resume this fall unless a Lindenhurst-based nonprofit receives an infusion of cash.

The Long Island Minority AIDS Coalition, which has sponsored the testing in conjunction with the New York State Department of Health, lost its Nassau County funding in April during a wave of cutbacks. The nonprofit organizes the local testing and provides a mobile van for the procedures. Health care practitioners from the state's Anonymous Counseling and Testing program conduct the tests.

Losing the $110,000 annual county allocation -- a quarter of the coalition's budget -- has put a range of services the nonprofit sponsors in jeopardy.

Operating out of a one-story building on Route 109, the coalition has served as an advocacy, policy and health services organization since the 1980s. With competition for funding from nongovernment sources becoming stiffer and community needs growing, the group is seeking money from private sources.

""We're hoping something turns up soon,"" said coalition executive director Rabia Aziz, noting that Nassau had provided funding annually since 1992.

Brian Nevin, spokesman for Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano, said eliminating allocations is painful but necessary ""to rein in spending and prevent a property tax hike.""

Dozens of other social service organizations that address the medical needs of Long Islanders, Nevin said, have also lost funding.

The anonymous HIV testing project has been conducted for nearly two decades on college campuses, including Hofstra, Adelphi, SUNY Old Westbury, C.W. Post, Farmingdale State College and Nassau Community College.

Dr. Debra Kaplan, a psychology professor at SUNY Old Westbury, has worked closely with the coalition and says its work is vital to all of Long Island.

""It would be a complete travesty and disservice not only to the college community but the community at large if they could not continue their important mission,"" she said.

Anonymous HIV testing for students of any ethnicity is only one of the coalition's roles. It has been providing HIV-prevention education in minority communities in both Nassau and Suffolk for more than two decades. Aziz and her colleagues also counsel homeless people and sponsor a syringe-access program for drug users.

All could be lost if funding isn't replaced soon. Aziz is applying to private foundations for grants in hopes of plugging the gap.

""I had to lay off our health educator because of the cutback,"" said Aziz, whose staff consists of herself, one other full-time employee and a part-timer.

The coalition's financial troubles have arrived, she said, as the HIV epidemic on Long Island has begun to gray with the aging of the population.

The local epidemic is additionally complicated, Aziz said, by the recent explosion of intravenous heroin use.

""We have the largest population of HIV-positive people in suburban America and actually more people than some states,"" added Aziz, citing state health department figures, which put Long Island's HIV population at 5,800.",05/07/2011
NewsDay,Anti-gay bullies are no joke,"Americans seem to find a lot of entertainment value in watching celebrities destroy themselves. Witness, for example, the brisk ticket sales for Charlie Sheen's recent meltdown tour.

But even by that low cultural standard, Tracy Morgan's recent rant in Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium against gays and lesbians is just plain sad, if not pathetic to the point of causing a public nuisance.

Both he and the auditorium have since apologized. The best that might be said for the co-star of NBC's ""30 Rock"" and former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member is that maybe he was trying to put his audience on with his June 3 rant. Maybe he was trying to play a black Archie Bunker and things -- like his mind -- went out of control.

Several audience members reportedly walked out when Morgan said homosexuality was a choice because, ""God doesn't make a mistake."" By the way, like others who argue that homosexuality is a choice, Morgan did not explain why homosexuals would want to make that choice, since it obviously exposes them to ostracism and abuse, especially from people like Morgan.

""Gay is something that kids learn from the media and programming,"" he said, sounding like the late Rev. Jerry Falwell's crusade against the Teletubbies.

He also scolded gays to stop ""whining about something as insignificant as bullying."" What if his son were gay? Morgan said he ""better talk to me like a man and not in a gay voice or I'll pull out a knife and stab that little ----- to death.""

Afterward, Tracy said in X-rated terms that he didn't care if he angered gays because ""they can take a ... joke."" Days later he was more contrite. He apologized profusely. He partnered with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. He met with homeless gay teens and a mother who lost her child to anti-gay violence. He swore up and down that he didn't have an anti-gay bone in his body.

So it goes. We've become so accustomed to such gaffe-and-apology rituals from various newsmakers that this one wouldn't be particularly noteworthy, except for another happenstance: Morgan's tirade leads a parade of celebrity gaffes that turned this year's LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) Pride Month into a pageant of gay-bashing with the stars.

There was singer Chris Brown, who apologized via Twitter for shouting ""gay"" among other epithets at photographers in Los Angeles. There was singer Cee Lo Green who apologized for scoffing ""I'm guessing you're gay?"" in a Twitter response to a critic's negative review.

Both episodes echoed Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant's apology and $100,000 fine for yelling anti-gay slurs at a referee in April. And let's not forget Chicago Bulls' Joakim Noah's $50,000 fine in May for directing a similar slur at a fan during the Eastern Conference Finals.

Sure, these folks are only entertainers. But if there's anything gay and lesbian teens don't need it is celebrities like Morgan, in particular, who make light of bullying and other harassment. High school can be hellish enough for teens, gay or straight, without TV stars cheering on the knuckleheads.

""I was beat up or taunted every day,"" a gay friend, now middle-aged, recalls of his four years in a mostly black high school on Chicago's South Side. ""I think the worst part was feeling all alone. Not having anyone to talk to about it. Not even in my own family.""

Stories like his helped me to understand why various studies show gay and lesbian teens are more likely to be bullied and commit suicide than their heterosexual peers.

It is also sadly significant that all of the above examples happen to be black Americans. A 2009 Pew Research Center poll, for example, found blacks (64 percent) to be more likely than whites (48 percent) or Hispanics (43 percent) to say homosexuality is morally wrong.

Sadly enough, a lot of those anti-gay attitudes often are encouraged by black churches. Pulpit declarations to ""Hate the sin, love the sinner,"" too often encourage people to hate both.

With youth violence and HIV, among other plagues, troubling our communities, the religious institutions that historically led the fight for racial equality have important new bridges to build within the black community. Maybe Tracy Morgan can help.

NewsDay,Prominent Chinese activist released,"BEIJING - A prominent Chinese dissident who was jailed for sedition more than three years ago was released Sunday, his wife said.

A major figure in China's dissident community, Hu Jia was active in a broad range of civil liberties issues before he was imprisoned in 2008. His 3 1/2-year prison sentence was set to end Sunday.

He returned home before dawn, Hu's wife Zeng Jinyan said in an online message. ""Safe, very happy. Needs to recuperate for a period of time,"" Zeng said in a Twitter message.

No one answered Zeng's phones on Sunday, but she had said earlier she would announce his release on Twitter. She had visited him on Monday at the Beijing Municipal Prison.

Hu, 37, is known for his activism with AIDS patients and orphans. The sedition charge stems from police accusations that he planned to work with foreigners to disturb the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

Hu's release comes amid one of the Chinese government's broadest campaigns of repression in years as Beijing has moved to prevent the growth of an Arab-style protest movement.

There have been concerns that, like other dissidents released recently from jail, Hu might be kept under some sort of illegal detention.

In a posting last week, Zeng said that upon his release, Hu, who suffers from a liver ailment, would be deprived of his political rights for one year and will not be able to speak to the media.

""For this one year the focus should be on treating his cirrhosis, caring for parents and child, to avoid being arrested again,"" she wrote.

Hu, 37, is known for his activism with AIDS patients and orphans. The sedition charge stems from police accusations that he planned to work with foreigners to disturb the 2008 Olympic Games.

In late 2008, Hu won the European Parliament's top human rights award, the 50,000-euro ($72,000) Sakharov Prize. Hu was honored in Strasbourg, France, where because he was in prison, his name was placed in front of an empty seat.

China's government heaped scorn on the award, with Beijing calling Hu a criminal.

Initially an advocate for the rights of HIV/AIDS patients, Hu expanded his efforts after the government gave little ground and he began to see the country's problems as rooted in authorities' lack of respect for human rights.

Hu used the Internet and telephone to chronicle the harassment and arrests of other dissidents and also published a series of articles criticizing the authorities for using the Olympics to mask serious human rights abuses.

In recent months, hundreds of lawyers, activists and other intellectuals have been questioned, detained, confined to their homes or simply disappeared in the wake of online appeals calling for peaceful protests across the country similar to those in the Arab world. Though no protests took place, the calls spooked the Chinese government into launching the clampdown.",25/06/2011
NewsDay,Michelle Obama defends husband on Africa,"Visiting Africa on a goodwill mission, first lady Michelle Obama defended her husband Friday against criticism that he isn't paying enough attention to the continent. She said her week-long trip to South Africa and Botswana is proof of the president's commitment to Africa.

""This trip is a reflection, a direct reflection, of his support and his interest and his view of the importance of Africa to the world and to the future of the world,"" she said. ""That's why I'm here.""

Given that Barack Obama is America's first black president and his father was from Kenya, many had hoped to see stepped-up U.S. involvement on the vast continent during his presidency. Africans also longed for Obama to visit so they could welcome home a U.S president they consider one of their sons.

He did visit, stopping in Ghana in 2009. But he stayed less than 24 hours and has not been back to Africa.

The first lady said people expect a lot from her overworked husband and that some won't ever think what he does is enough.

""He would love to be here but there's a lot of work to do on the domestic front,"" she told four American reporters traveling with her. ""And as president it's hard to predict and plan internationally because you've got domestic stuff hitting you left and right"".

""Africa's absolutely important to him,"" she added. ""I understand why people feel like they want more. It's a big continent, a lot of challenges. But I think his record and the number of senior officials who've spent so much time in Africa ... that is a reflection of this administration's commitment to this continent.""

White House officials previously have pointed to the president's involvement in Libya, Sudan and Ivory Coast as examples of his commitment to Africa, along with repeat visits by such senior administration officials as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Mrs. Obama said she is her husband's ""direct representative"" and as such she was the one who met Friday with Botswanan President Ian Khama. The two emerged from his office after about 45 minutes and shook hands for the news media. They made no remarks.

The White House said later that they underscored the ""breadth and depth"" of the relationship between their countries. Botswana is considered one of Africa's most stable democracies and has held 10 successive democratic elections since becoming independent in 1966.

Khama expressed appreciation for US assistance, including life-saving support for HIV/AIDS patients, the White House said. HIV/AIDS is a major public health challenge in Botswana, a Texas-sized country of 2 million people in southern Africa. About 300,000 Botswanans are infected with the disease.

They also discussed youth leadership, the key theme that Mrs. Obama has been promoting in Africa, and Khama's interest in conservation. Khama also sent his best wishes to Obama.

Mrs. Obama opened the second leg of her trip in Botswana on Friday by wielding a paint brush to help create a mural at a children's HIV/AIDS clinic sponsored by Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. The facility treats more than 4,000 children and their families.

The US has spent more than $450 million since 2005 to help Botswana deal with AIDS. The country's efforts and partnerships with academic institutions and foundations have helped more than 95 percent of infected Botswanans get treatment, officials said.

The first lady also had lunch with a group of women, many of whom have overcome personal challenges, and their mentors. She told them that she's proof that success isn't about money or connections because her parents had neither of those. It's ""about how much one believes in their own potential,"" she said.

After the call on Khama, Mrs. Obama ended the day at the Mokolodi Nature Reserve, where family and staff had dinner.

The first lady is traveling with her daughters, Malia, 12, and Sasha, 10; her mother, Marian Robinson; and a niece and nephew, Leslie and Avery Robinson, 15 and 19, respectively. She began the trip Monday, spending two days each in Johannesburg and Cape Town in South Africa before moving on to Botswana.

She is due back at the White House early Monday, after a private family safari this weekend.",24/06/2011
NewsDay,First lady visits South Africa with family,"PRETORIA, South Africa - First lady Michelle Obama embarked on a goodwill visit to sub-Saharan Africa on Monday, a weeklong stay designed to show that America cares about the continent's issues and people.

Accompanied by her two daughters, her mother, a niece and nephew, Mrs. Obama planned a trip through South Africa and Botswana that was also shaping up to be an emotional and educational journey for the three generations of Obamas.

Many of the first lady's stops will highlight the legacy of Nelson Mandela and others like him whose struggles and sacrifices ultimately led to the undoing of apartheid, South Africa's system of racial separation.

Mandela spent 27 years in prison, including 18 years on Robben Island off the coast of Cape Town, for his role in the anti-apartheid movement. After he was released in 1990, he went on to become the country's first post-apartheid president and its first black elected leader, swept into office in 1994. He served one term and remains a revered elder statesman.

A meeting between America's first black first lady and South Africa's first black president was hoped for but remained unlikely as of Monday. At age 92, Mandela is fragile and his health determines when he can receive visitors. Mrs. Obama was, however, meeting Tuesday with Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, as well as one of the wives of Jacob Zuma, the current president.

Mrs. Obama received a warm welcome upon her arrival Monday night at Waterkloof Air Force Base in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, after 18 hours and more than 8,100 miles of travel. She was greeted by Ambassador Donald Gips and his family on a nippy night. Daughters Malia, 12, and Sasha, 10, were wrapped in colorful South African blankets to ward off the chill.

Throughout the week, the first lady will promote youth leadership, education and HIV/AIDS prevention programs. The high point of the week is a speech Wednesday to a U.S.-sponsored gathering of young African women leaders from across sub-Saharan Africa.

The first lady will pay tribute to Mandela and the struggle against apartheid at many of her stops, including visits to his foundation, the Apartheid Museum and Robben Island. She also was scheduled to meet in Cape Town with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end apartheid.

She heads to Gaborone, Botswana, on Friday for a visit with President Ian Khama and other events. The trip ends with private family time on the weekend, including a dinner at a game park and a safari before the Obamas return to Washington late Monday.

This is Mrs. Obama's fourth time visiting Africa, but these are her first stops in South Africa and Botswana.

It's also the second time she has traveled outside the United States without President Barack Obama, whose father was from Kenya. In April 2010, she traveled alone to Mexico City and Haiti, after its devastating earthquake.",20/06/2011
NewsDay,Larry Kramer to appear at Guild Hall,"Larry Kramer, whose 1985 breakthrough play about the AIDS crisis won this year’s Tony Award for best revival, will be part of a theatrical presentation Saturday at Guild Hall’s John Drew Theater in East Hampton.

Joining the “The Normal Heart” author will be Terrence McNally, winner of four Tony Awards and an Emmy. His Tony-nominated musical “Catch Me If You Can” is currently running on Broadway, and “Master Class,” which won the Tony for best play in 1995, is in previews for its Broadway revival starring Tyne Daley.

The John Drew program will benefit Southampton Hospital’s new Rose Walton Care Services at the David E. Rogers MD Center. The Walton facility provides outpatient care — ranging from medications to psychosocial support — for people living with HIV/AIDS.

Before retiring, Dr. Rose Walton trained health care workers as director of the Stony Brook University Hospital’s AIDS Education and Resource Center.

In “The Normal Heart,” which premiered at Manhattan’s Public Theatre, Kramer expressed his frustration with bureaucratic paralysis and governmental indifference as well as the apathy of gay men toward AIDS.

In his Tony-acceptance speech Sunday, Kramer said, “To gay people everywhere, whom I love so dearly, ‘The Normal Heart’ is our history. I could not have written it had not so many needlessly died. Learn from it and carry on the fight.”

In 1981, Kramer co-founded the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the largest private organization in the world assisting people living with AIDS. He founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in 1987, a group widely credited with changing public health policy and the perception of people diagnosed with AIDS and HIV.

Tickets for the benefit program, $250, are available by calling Kathy Lucas of the Southampton Hospital Foundation, 631-726-8700, extension 3, or emailing her at klucas@southamptonhospital.org.",17/06/2011
NewsDay,City abuzz: Novice beekeepers blamed for recent swarms,"Three swarms of honeybees have descended on Manhattan neighborhoods in as many weeks, a freakish streak that is actually the surprising result of the legalization last year of beekeeping in the city, experts told amNewYork.

In a flash, beekeepers in the city increased almost tenfold, to some 250, experts said. The spurt was powered by growing popular interest and tutorial classes.

But many of these beekeepers, who tend to the insects on rooftops and in community gardens, are amateurs who easily lose control of their growing hives.

So far this year, swarms have descended on Little Italy, midtown, and most recently, Chinatown, on Monday.

""Without enough room to grow [in their own hives], the bees are making their own room,"" said Andrew Coté of the New York City Beekeepers Association. He has gotten more calls about swarms this year, likely because of legalization.

Beekeeping was outlawed in 1999 by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who put bees on an illegal critter list that includes lions, alligators and grizzly bears.

But after years of fighting what beekeepers called the ""Bitter Years,"" along with support from former Councilman David Yassky, the practice was decriminalized.

Now most novice keepers generally have about two ""hives"" that can contain anywhere from 10,000 to as many as 100,000 bees in warmer months. Thing is, spring is prime time for swarms.

""When a beehive gets too full, you make a split and make another beehive. But if you're not watching it, they'll swarm and go looking for a new home,"" said John Howe founder of New York City Beekeeping, which now has about 1,200 members, most of whom are bee enthusiasts.

The bees have been drawn to objects such as lampposts and mailboxes, but these gathering places hold no particular fascination for the insects.

""It's just a place to hang out while the scouts look for another home"" like an abandoned tree, Howe said.

But even with beekeepers popping up everywhere and bees swarming in droves, New York shouldn’t worry about stinging rampages.

""Swarms are absolutely of no danger to anyone,"" Coté said. ""There's a perceived danger, but truly, they're docile, friendly and just looking for a home. They're down and out.""",14/06/2011
NewsDay,Magnet Gun fires Red Faction: Armageddon,"The video-game gun hall of fame has a new contender, thanks to Red Faction: Armageddon.

It's called the Magnet Gun. Your first shot fires a magnet; your second shot releases an anchor, which attracts the magnetized surface. Shoot once into a ceiling, once onto a floor and you can cause a building to collapse into rubble. It's a new tool for the Red Faction universe, which has always thrived on large-scale property demolition.

Red Faction takes place on 22nd century Mars, which Earthlings have tried to terraform into a livable environment. In the prologue to Armageddon, a cult leader has destroyed the terraformer, driving the colonists underground. There, they discover a new threat, awakening a hive of vicious, insectoid aliens. From there, Armageddon turns into a fairly predictable bug hunt. Your character, Darius Mason, is sent deeper into the tunnels of Mars to eradicate the aliens (as well as Adam Hale, the cult leader).

Your arsenal is impressive. You get toys like the Nano Rifle, which shoots swarms of all-consuming nanoparticles, and the Singularity Cannon, which swallows monsters with a miniature black hole. But the Magnet Gun is the most effective. If you stumble across a building infested with aliens, you can crush them by flattening the structure.

NewsDay,Opinion: The AIDS challenge after 30 years,"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and Gregory K. Folkers is Fauci’s chief of staff. This is from Kaiser Health News.

Thirty years ago, the first five cases of what is now known as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome were reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The amount of knowledge gained since then has been extraordinary, and the pace at which research findings have been translated into lifesaving treatments and tools of prevention is unprecedented. But much remains to be done to deliver the fruits of this research to the people who need them most.

The discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus as the cause of AIDS in 1983-84 was followed by an understanding of how HIV leads to AIDS; the creation of a diagnostic blood test; and the development over the years of more than 30 antiretroviral drugs. The approval of the first protease inhibitors in 1995-96 paved the way for powerful, multi-drug antiretroviral therapy.

The many combination regimens now available have dramatically improved the quality of life and extended the life expectancy of people with HIV. An HIV-infected person properly treated with this combination therapy, and provided other needed care and services, now can expect to live for decades after being diagnosed. Antiretroviral regimens also can prevent HIV infection, energizing the medical, public health and activist communities.

Entering the fourth decade of HIV and AIDS, our task is to build on these advances and deliver scientifically validated interventions to everyone who needs them, in the United States and abroad. Six in 10 HIV-infected people in developing countries who need combination antiretroviral therapy are not receiving it, which puts their health and that of their sexual partners at risk.

Domestically, access to treatment and care isn't optimal, either. A recent analysis estimated that of the 1.1 million people living with HIV in the United States, about 20 percent are unaware of their infection. And within the entire group of infected people, only about 19 percent have a viral load that has been driven to undetectable levels by combination therapy.

Both at home and globally, greater numbers of HIV-infected individuals need to be identified early in the course of their disease, through expanded voluntary testing programs and linkage to appropriate care and antiretroviral treatment.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In addition, prevention programs using proven tools must be refined, improved and made more cost-effective. At the same time, we must continue to develop additional effective prevention strategies.

We also must find innovative approaches to curing HIV/AIDS by eradicating or permanently suppressing the virus in infected people, thereby eliminating the need for lifelong antiretroviral therapy. In addition, a robust research effort is critical to address the malignancies, cardiovascular and metabolic complications, and premature aging associated with long-term HIV disease and/or antiretroviral therapy.

Despite these challenges and the huge burden of this modern-day plague, we now look at the fight against HIV/AIDS -- and our chances of prevailing -- with considerably more optimism than before. With the medical and public health tools now or soon to be available, controlling and ending the global HIV pandemic are feasible goals.

Unfortunately, there are considerable global constraints on resources to support this goal. Every effort must be made to efficiently apply existing resources, so that proven interventions are delivered in the most cost-effective way. Public-sector, commercial and philanthropic commitments to AIDS research and implementation of proven findings must be sustained and strengthened with additional resources, to ensure that HIV treatment and prevention services are universally available to the people who need them, wherever they live.

With a global commitment, we can control and ultimately end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. On this commemoration of the 30-year anniversary, let's recommit ourselves to that goal.",09/06/2011
NewsDay,HIV/AIDS outreach pioneer to be honored,"A June 18 ceremony at Guild Hall in East Hampton will honor Rose Walton, an HIV/AIDS outreach pioneer and, until she retired more than 15 years ago, director of the AIDS Education and Resource Center at Stony Brook University.

Tom Kirdahy, a producer and former chairman of the East End Gay Organization, said that Walton, who lives in Southampton Town, made AIDS care possible for many at a time when little was being done to deal with the disease. “She made all the HIV services on Long Island happen...she opened the door for all of us,” he said.

The event, which is supported by the East End arts community, will feature presentations by playwright and author Larry Kramer, who co-founded the Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1981, and playwright Terrence McNally.

The event is being timed to coincide with the renaming of Southampton Hospital’s its HIV/AIDS center to the Rose Walton Care Services at the David E. Rogers MD Center for HIV and AIDS.

The first case of AIDS was diagnosed 30 years ago, and hospital officials said it was appropriate to mark that milestone by honoring Walton’s “commitment and concern for those living with HIV/AIDS.”",08/06/2011
NewsDay,Change rule on organs with HIV,"Not so long ago the notion of transplanting HIV-infected organs was unthinkable. Not any more, if both donors and recipients are HIV-positive.

Extraordinary advances in treatment over the past 20 years have changed HIV infection from a rapid death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. Because people with HIV are living longer, other chronic conditions, such as kidney and liver failure, have emerged as problems. So the number of HIV-positive people who need transplants is growing.

But organs are always in short supply. And the National Organ Transplant Act was amended in 1988 -- at the height of the HIV scare -- to make it illegal to transplant an HIV-infected organ into anyone. Congress should relax that ban to allow organs from deceased, HIV-positive donors to be transplanted into willing recipients living with HIV.

Concerns about transmitting virulent or drug-resistant strains of HIV to recipients will need to be addressed by doctors. And strict protocols must be developed to avoid mix-ups that could result in infected organs accidentally going to people without HIV.

But researchers, led by Dr. Dorry Segev at Johns Hopkins University, estimated that about 500 HIV-infected but otherwise healthy organs could be available each year for transplantation while about 1,000 HIV-positive people need organs. For them, an infected organ could be the difference between life and death. They shouldn't be denied that shot.",07/06/2011
NewsDay,Proposal urges use of HIV-infected organs,"A proposal that would increase the number of organs available for transplant calls on doctors to consider those from deceased HIV-infected donors for use in HIV-infected patients who otherwise might die waiting for a kidney, liver or heart.

It has been illegal to transplant an HIV-infected organ into anyone since the National Organ Transplant Act was amended 23 years ago -- at the height of the HIV scare.

The proposal, reported as part of a larger study in the June issue of the American Journal of Transplantation, represents a change in how HIV is perceived, doctors said last week, and also pushes for a new way to increase the organ pool.

Dr. Ernesto Molmenti, director of the transplant program at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, said such a policy change is long overdue.

""The number of HIV patients who need transplants is increasing, especially for kidneys,"" said Molmenti, also North Shore's vice chairman for surgery.

He said kidney damage generally occurs in people infected with HIV because of the medications used to treat it. Other organs also are subject to failure in HIV patients, he said.

HIV patients have been placed on lists as transplant candidates only in recent years. Doctors previously thought the patients' viral condition so severely compromised their immunity that they could not withstand the rigors of surgery and subsequent treatments to tamp down their immune systems.

Dr. Dorry Segev, associate professor of clinical research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and lead author of the report, found that 500 HIV-infected but otherwise healthy organs are discarded annually. Estimates based on Segev's research put the number of HIV-infected people in need of organs at more than 1,000.

Sign up for the Power on Trial newsletter Get our insider's look and analysis of the key moments in the Manganos' retrial. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In 2010, an estimated 178 HIV-positive people received kidneys or livers, up from nine 11 years ago, according to the HIV Medicine Association, a professional organization.

Overall, the United Network for Organ Sharing estimates more than 111,000 people await organs of all kinds, but slightly more than 2,000 donors have become available so far this year.

Because HIV/AIDS is no longer an immediate death sentence and can be managed as a chronic condition, banning HIV-infected organ transplants is no longer prudent, Segev said.

""If Congress reversed its ban,"" he said, ""between 500 and 1,000 HIV-infected patients with kidney or liver failure each year could get transplants.""

Lifting the ban could reduce HIV patients' risk of death while on the waiting list, Segev said.

Some policy experts are uncertain about the idea.

""HIV is different in every person,"" said Rabia Aziz, chief executive of the Long Island Minority AIDS Coalition, a policy and advocacy organization in Lindenhurst.

She questioned whether organs taken from people with highly virulent, drug-resistant strains would pose an additional threat to organ recipients.

Others fear mix-ups are possible.",04/06/2011
NewsDay,Dear Pharmacist: Shop for high-quality supplements,"Dear Pharmacist: Are there certain ways to shop and ensure that I buy high-quality supplements? --J.J. Boynton Beach, Florida

Yes. Here’s some advice that can help you make better selections:

Check for artificial colors — Dyes and Lakes are unnecessary additives to make supplements prettier but many are coal tar derived. Because there is no benefit obtained from artificial colors, I think they should be avoided. The Food and Drug Administration allows colors because they say they pose no risk when used properly, but I think that depends on who you ask.

Some colors like tartrazine (a.k.a. FD&C Yellow 5 or E102) can trigger allergies in people; skin rashes, hives, migraines, nasal congestion, asthma, anxiety, depression or diarrhea. Some colors are are suspected in hyperactivity (ADHD) and DNA damage (think cancer). Colors are frequently used in medications to help distinguish tablets, but less frequently used in supplements.

Check for allergy-causing ingredients- I think it’s nice when a maker takes special care to avoid the items that many are sensitive to. Try to avoid wheat, gluten, dairy, corn, soy and sugar. There are many additives, some natural ones too, that can trigger problems. Download a free brochure called “Food Additives” from www.FoodAdditives.org.

Check for bizarre or unnecessary additives- Like high fructose corn syrup, carmine (red bug colorant), or shellac. The insidious thing here is that you can’t always tell what’s actually “added” because it’s done during manufacturing.

Did You Know?

If you’re suffering with itchy watery eyes, conjunctivitis or seasonal eye allergies, try Zaditor eye drops. It used to be prescription, but it’s sold OTC now and it’s strong.

NewsDay,East Setauket woman killed in Conn. crash,"A Connecticut car wreck early yesterday morning killed a woman from East Setauket who at 27 had already earned two Ivy League degrees, pushed for HIV/AIDS medicine in India and advocated for young women's education in Africa, friends and relatives said.

The crash that killed Laura Kavazanjian happened on Interstate 95 in Groton, Conn., about 1:30 a.m. as she headed back to Long Island for the wedding of a Ward Melville High School classmate.

Kavazanjian's fiance, David Reidy, was behind the wheel when the car left the road and rolled onto its hood, The Associated Press reported. Authorities and family members said Kavazanjian, who was asleep in the backseat, was thrown from the car. Reidy was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, AP said. Connecticut police did not immediately return a call.

Kavazanjian, a former field hockey defensive back at Brown University, was returning from the Rhode Island school's five-year college reunion. She recently completed a master's degree in international education policy at Harvard Graduate School of Education that focused on access to education for marginalized girls.

Her father, Tom, also a Brown alum, said his daughter was passionate about helping women in the developing world get an education.

Said her mother, Jan: ""What she really valued in her life was her ability to get a great education as a girl -- and she wanted to offer that to other girls.""

Kavazanjian's Brown classmates and teammates are devastated, said her field hockey coach, Carolan Norris.

""She was going to make a difference in this world, for sure,"" she said. ""And she already had -- even in her short five years after Brown.""

Teammate Kristen Vincent, 27, said she and other teammates plan to go to Long Island for a memorial service at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at Setauket Presbyterian Church. Visitation will be at the church on Friday from 2 to 4 p.m. and 7 to 9 p.m.

Vincent remembered Kavazanjian as ""the hardest worker that I've ever met,"" both on the field and in the classroom.

""She would sit in the library and just work and work and work,"" Vincent said.

Brown's president, Ruth Simmons, said: ""The university has reached out to Laura's family to offer our deepest condolences and support at this most difficult time. We extend our sincere sympathy to all of Laura's classmates and friends, and join with them in mourning her tragic and untimely passing.""

Kavazanjian had done research in Malawi and worked for Save the Children and CARE for the Power to Lead Alliance, a program aimed at developing leadership among adolescent girls in six countries.

Before Harvard, she had worked as a program officer for the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative in Mumbai, India, where she designed and implemented a care and support program for more than 4,000 children living with HIV.

Kavazanjian also played field hockey at Ward Melville, from which she graduated in 2002. She was an All-State player in 2000 and an All-Long Island player in 2001.

A friend, Doris C. Nolan, who answered the telephone listed for his Manhattan recording company, said he died in the afternoon at St. Luke's Hospital after becoming sick upon returning from a trip to Europe.

""We're all sort of shattered,"" she said.

Scott-Heron was known for work that reflected the fury of black America in the post-civil rights era and also spoke to the social and political disparities in the country. His songs often had incendiary titles — ""Home is Where the Hatred Is,"" or ""Whitey on the Moon,"" and through spoken word and song, he tapped the frustration of the masses.

Yet much of his life was also defined by his battle with crack cocaine, which also led to time in jail. In a 2008 interview with New York magazine, he said he had been living with HIV for years, but he still continued to perform and put out music; his last album, which came out this year, was a collaboration with artist Jamie xx, ""We're Still Here,"" a reworking of Scott-Heron's acclaimed ""I'm New Here,"" which was released in 2010.

He was also still smoking crack, as detailed in a New Yorker article last year.

""Ten to fifteen minutes of this, I don't have pain,"" he said. ""I could have had an operation a few years ago, but there was an 8 percent chance of paralysis. I tried the painkillers, but after a couple of weeks I felt like a piece of furniture. It makes you feel like you don't want to do anything. This I can quit anytime I'm ready.""

Scott-Heron's influence on rap was such that he sometimes was referred to as the Godfather of Rap, a title he rejected.

""If there was any individual initiative that I was responsible for it might have been that there was music in certain poems of mine, with complete progression and repeating 'hooks,' which made them more like songs than just recitations with percussion,"" he wrote in the introduction to his 1990 collection of poems, ""Now and Then.""

He referred to his signature mix of percussion, politics and performed poetry as bluesology or Third World music. But then he said it was simply ""black music or black American music.""

""Because black Americans are now a tremendously diverse essence of all the places we've come from and the music and rhythms we brought with us,"" he wrote.

Nevertheless, his influence on generations of rappers has been demonstrated through sampling of his recordings by artists, including Kanye West, who closes out the last track of his latest album with a long excerpt of Scott-Heron's ""Who Will Survive in America.""

Scott-Heron recorded the song that would make him famous, ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,"" which critiqued mass media, for the album ""125th and Lenox"" in Harlem in the 1970s. He followed up that recording with more than a dozen albums, initially collaborating with musician Brian Jackson. His most recent album was ""I'm New Here,"" which he began recording in 2007 and was released in 2010.

Throughout his musical career, he took on political issues of his time, including apartheid in South Africa and nuclear arms. He had been shaped by the politics of the 1960s and black literature, especially the Harlem Renaissance.

Scott-Heron was born in Chicago on April 1, 1949. He was raised in Jackson, Tenn., and in New York before attending college at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.

Before turning to music, he was a novelist, at age 19, with the publication of ""The Vulture,"" a murder mystery.",28/05/2011
NewsDay,New drugs OKd for treating hepatitis C,"Betty Dufour didn't realize she carried the hepatitis C virus until deciding on a whim 11 years ago to be screened.

Dufour, 62, of Lindenhurst, learned she not only carried the virus but that she probably had been infected for years with a strain that until this month had been the most difficult to treat.

Dufour said she didn't know how or when she got hepatitis C. ""Like so many other people infected with it, the important thing is not how you got it but how to get rid of it,"" she said.

Dufour is a candidate for one of two new medications that help to control the disease. Known as protease inhibitors, Incivek, approved on Tuesday and Victrelis, approved two weeks ago, block hepatitis C's ability to seize control of its host's DNA, which the virus uses to replicate itself.

Dufour's physician, Dr. Melissa Palmer, a Plainview liver specialist, is pleased that the new medications are available for treating hepatitis C.

Hepatitis C affects about 4 million people in the United States, but millions of cases go undetected because most people initially have only vague symptoms, such as fatigue or muscle aches. Many people learn they are infected when they develop a serious condition, such as cirrhosis or liver failure. Hepatitis C is passed through contact with contaminated blood -- most commonly through needles shared during illegal drug use.

""Hepatitis C has not gotten the awareness that HIV and multiple other diseases have gotten,"" Palmer said Wednesday. ""When I first started my practice 20 years ago, 6 percent of people with hepatitis C could be cured. Now, with the two new drugs, we can probably cure 70 percent. But . . . people don't think they need to be screened.""

Hepatitis C has become so prevalent on Long Island that doctors, nurses, social service experts and advocates earlier this year formed the Long Island Regional Hepatitis C Task Force. The group estimates 44,000 Long Islanders are infected and don't know it.

Dr. Brian Edlin, a hepatitis C researcher at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, Wednesday blamed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for seriously underestimating hepatitis C's prevalence. Writing in yesterday's edition of the journal Nature, he argued the CDC not only has underestimated hepatitis C among homeless people and the incarcerated, he contends the agency has not considered the prevalence of the virus among people in their 40s, 50s and 60s.

""There may be 6 to 8 million [nationwide] who have it and 75 percent don't know,"" Edlin said.

Hepatitis C, Palmer added, is the largest single reason for liver transplants in the United States.

Jennifer Horvath, spokeswoman for the CDC, said the agency takes hepatitis C infection seriously and is conducting a new study called BEST-C, which involves screening anyone born between 1945 and 1965 for the virus. If the study helps turn up substantial new cases, the agency could possibly recommend random screening of baby boomers.

Dufour, a member of a Long Island support group for people with hepatitis C, said: ""Most of the people in my support group are my age. I suppose it's a baby boomer disease.""",25/05/2011
NewsDay,"Scrutiny for Nassau HIV-AIDS group, chief","Nassau County Comptroller George Maragos Tuesday announced a probe of a taxpayer-funded HIV-AIDS group, contending that the agency's president earned more than $525,000 in 2009.

Maragos said Gail Barouh, president and chief executive of the Long Island Association for AIDS Care, received $363,205 from the organization in 2009. She also earned a total of $106,528 that year from BiasHELP, a not-for-profit focused on prevention of bias crimes, and $56,672 from the Long Island Network of Community Service, which helps nonprofits with fundraising and other functions, Maragos said.

""While the salary of this individual is not determined by the county it certainly raises a red flag. . . . We cannot allow CEOs of nonprofits to live lavishly off the charity of our taxpayers intended to help the sick and the needy,"" Maragos said in a statement.

Maragos said his office will begin an audit to determine the proportion of $220,000 in various Nassau contracts with LIAAC during 2010 that went to residents seeking service.

Katherine Heaviside, spokeswoman for Barouh, challenged Maragos' numbers. Heaviside said Barouh earned $244,000 plus $25,500 in health and pension benefits at LIAAC in 2009.

Heaviside said Barouh worked at BiasHELP, but she had no information on her earnings in the temporary job that year.

Heaviside said Barouh in 2009 also had a $56,000-a-year contract with LINCS, which owns its headquarters building in Hauppauge, where LIAAC and BiasHELP are based. Heaviside said the contract was to administer the building and LINCS health and pension plans. Barouh is listed on all three websites as the chief executive officer.

In a letter Tuesday responding to Maragos' news release, Garden City lawyer Debra Wabnik told Maragos and County Executive Edward Mangano to, among other things, stop giving ""false information"" on Barouh's compensation and to retract Maragos' news release.

NewsDay,How Newsday critic reacted to Oprah debut,"Here's an excerpt of how Marvin Kitman, Newsday's TV critic from 1969 to 2004, weighed in on the first ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" in a column that ran on Sept. 10, 1986.

The arrival of a new morning talk show host is always an important event, like a new neighbor moving in next door, somebody you can have coffee with, somebody you'll be seeing a lot of before she moves away (gets canceled or moves to another time slot).

One arrival creating a lot of excitement is Oprah Winfrey, who blew in from Chicago Monday with the first of her daily nationally syndicated shows. She has been doing ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" in Chicago for two years, but this is the big test. Will it play in New York, not to mention Scranton and the other 132 cities King World has booked her into?

I've noticed that a lot of people can be excited by somebody who is supposed to be a big deal in Chicago. Until that person falls flat on his or her face in New York.

But Winfrey is terrific.

It takes at least a week for a talk show to sort of clear its throat. But here are a few first impressions:

Subscribe to the Entertainment newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

First, she is a large woman. Not that large, as some of the stories had been saying. They made it sound like you would need a special large screen to see all of her.

But she isn't that big. She is a presence, as I like to say.

What a nice change she is from the usual TV talk show host, who is thin, blond and hungry-looking. Like Kathie Lee on ""The Regis Philbin Show.""

Oprah is overweight, there is no doubt about it. Like real people. She's not just another pretty TV face. You'll never see her in Jack La Lanne commercials.

But she's super on TV. The best new person I've seen in the morning since Diane Sawyer.

She is loud and boisterous, compared to the thin blondes who are usually soft-spoken. She throws her arms around people. She is always touching them, making contact. It's nice to see a person like that on TV for a change.

Oprah had a reputation in Chicago for being a very outspoken individual, which I guess is very unusual in Chicago or Scranton. Outspokenness is not such a novelty in New York.

She is also very candid about herself. In her opening show, Monday, she confessed that the two major concerns in her life are 1) her thighs and 2) her love life. (That's actually three, but who's counting?)

There had been so much hoopla about the first show, Oprah said in her opening monologue, that she had hives under her armpits. ""Should my guests be Mother Teresa, the Pope, Greta Garbo or Don Johnson?"" But she had elected to go for what she does best -- everyday people with everyday problems. She wanted to come down to real people's levels.

I hope she does real well. And Oprah can come into my house for coffee any time.",24/05/2011

NewsDay,"State, Suffolk bicker over health care aid","The war of words over state health care aid to Suffolk County continued Saturday with New York's budget director accusing the county of improper billing.

State budget director Robert Megna said New York is withholding $15.2 million in health care funds from Suffolk because there was ""systemic improper billing on the part of the county.""

Megna disagreed with statements from County Executive Steve Levy and local legislators that the state is retroactively taking back money for services the county has already provided.

""Claims that the state is cutting $15 million from Suffolk County health centers are fundamentally inaccurate and needlessly frighten the New Yorkers who depend on these services,"" Megna said.

Levy disputed that the disagreement revolves around overbilling. ""They're outright lying,"" he said.

He and county budget director Connie Corso said the state will no longer fund some services, including treating people 21 and older at county health clinics. Levy and Corso said the county could deal with that change but not with retroactively taking back health care funding for aid it paid the county for services going back to 2008.

Presiding Officer William Lindsay (D-Holbrook) said he and the legislature's independent budget office agree with Levy.

County officials, though, could not immediately supply documentation that the loss of funds is related to the policy change.

A Sept. 3, 2010, letter to Suffolk Commissioner of Health Services, James Tomarken, supplied by the Cuomo administration Saturday night, noted a number of issues in which the state commissioner of health's office disputed payments for which the county was seeking reimbursement.

The issues included payments for primary care for HIV patients in county health clinics, and coordination of mental, social services and dental care for jail inmates after they are released from jail.

To combat the cut in state funding, the Levy administration ordered health center cutbacks. Among the hardest hit are the Elsie Owens Health Center at Coram, scheduled to close July 1, and the loss of 8,000 patient visits at the Dolan Family Health Center in Greenlawn.

Levy continued to blame the governor for the cuts, calling them ""the Cuomo clinic cuts.""

In his statement, Megna said, ""The state is in discussions and ongoing litigation with the county to resolve this dispute and we will continue to work with them [county officials] in good faith.""

The county sued the state last year challenging the retroactive health care cuts.

Saturday's back and forth came the same week that following Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy's statement that county executives should watch their spending, Levy said, ""I do not need lectures on how to control my own spending.""",14/05/2011
NewsDay,Study: Early treatment reduces HIV risk,"LOS ANGELES -- In what is being hailed as a landmark breakthrough in HIV prevention, a new study has shown that giving anti-AIDS drugs to HIV-positive people can reduce the transmission of the virus to spouses and partners by 96 percent, U.S. researchers said yesterday.

Though some uncontrolled studies of populations had previously suggested that treatment of patients with antiretroviral drugs could slow transmission of the virus, the new results announced by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases represent the first large clinical trial to confirm those suggestions.

In fact, the results of the study of nearly 1,800 couples in the United States and, primarily, southern Africa were so dramatic that the study's sponsors decided to terminate it prematurely -- four years before its scheduled completion in 2015.

The study shows that not only does early treatment of HIV infections benefit the patient's own health, but also ""there is clearly a benefit of a profound decrease in the probability of . . . transmission to his or her own partner,"" Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of NIAID, said in a news conference.

Antiretroviral treatment ""can definitely decrease rates of transmission, and we can get this disease under control,"" said Dr. Kathleen Squires, chairwoman of the HIV Medicine Association and director of the division of infectious diseases at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.

""This is scientific proof that this is true,"" said Squires, who was not involved in the study.

""This shows us that if we can identify the people who are infected and give them access to therapy, we can dramatically reduce the number of new infections in this country,"" she said. Unfortunately, she added, there are waiting lists for the drugs in many states because of the shortage of funds for health care.",12/05/2011
NewsDay,Hospices to honor Great Neck man's humor,"Howard Shapiro always managed to find something to laugh about.

It wasn't easy. Growing up secretly gay in Great Neck in the 1970s was a challenge, said his sister, Leslie Greenberg. In 1991, he was diagnosed with HIV and, she said, promptly fired from his job in publishing. He died five years later at 40.

""When he was diagnosed, instead of throwing the covers over his face, he got right out there and started making fun,"" said Greenberg, of Atlantic Beach and Manhattan. ""He could turn something around and make it funny.""

""He made light of the fact that he was dying,"" she said of her brother, who wrote a series of columns in several New York publications about his struggle with the illness.

In his memory, Greenberg and her husband, Joel, decided to work with MJHS -- a health-care agency formerly known as the Metropolitan Jewish Health System -- to help raise $16.8 million to open two hospices in New York City. The couple is donating Shapiro's extensive collection of celebrity memorabilia -- which he amassed when he was too sick to go out and spent time writing humorous letters to about a thousand stars - and spearheading fundraising efforts for the two hospices, in the Bronx and Brooklyn. They hope the facilities, which will display Shapiro's collection, can also incorporate some of his spirit of fun.

The organization plans to open hospice residences in the Bronx and in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, each with 16 units. The Brooklyn facility will have 16 one-bedroom, diamond-shaped suites, with space for patients as well as their visitors or families, all with ocean views, and there are plans to dedicate a wing to Shapiro. MJHS officials say they believe these will be the first hospices in the city to accept children.

Pediatrics ""is a particularly emotionally difficult area to work with, and the training is more complex, and the emotional challenges involved with a family are overwhelming,"" said David Nussbaum, MJHS' executive director.

Howard Shapiro's legacy fit perfectly with their mission, Nussbaum said.

"" Make no mistake about it. These are not eulogies,"" he said of the collection. ""In a strange sense . . . brings a certain sense of normalcy to people's lives who have been turned upside down.""

Shapiro, who didn't reveal he was gay until after he was diagnosed, began writing a monthly column for the Body Positive, a now-defunct magazine. Calling himself ""Kvetch"" (Yiddish for complainer) he told jokes, imagined outrageous scenarios, and described his worsening health with dry wit. (""I've become so weak that I ask a neighbor of mine to carry a lettuce leaf from the refrigerator to the salad bowl."")

He wrote about everything from his sister spraying Lysol before she walked into his Manhattan apartment, to an imagined conversation with an angel about whether heaven has TV Guide and pizza.

He wrote letters to celebrities on yellow-lined paper (To Roseanne Barr (Arnold), he wrote, ""I'm a Jewish Kvetch with HIV, but it could be worse. At least I'm not living with Tom Arnold."") He was thrilled and amazed to receive more than 500 responses, ranging from letters to signed headshots, which the Greenbergs cataloged and kept.

""I've been in possession of his collection, and I've been trying to find a home for it. I wanted it to be an inspiration for people going through terminal illness,"" Leslie Greenberg said. ""I contacted several people, and MJHS understood.""",12/05/2011

NewsDay,Federal budget compromise is unsatisfying,"Regarding ""Back to budget fight"" [News, April 11], the Republicans tested President Barack Obama on the tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, and in the spirit of compromise, Obama gave in and extended the cuts. He hoped that this would set the stage for compromise, but this is not how the GOP operates. Obama opened the door to all their demands, being slowly but surely met at the expense of the American middle class.

Had Obama stuck to his guns, the taxes on the wealthy would now keep the ""entitlement programs"" in place and safe from being destroyed by further blackmail which has proved to be successful for the GOP. It will continue if Obama does not speak the words we want to hear: Bring it on.

We want the president to stick to what he once said -- that Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are ""off the table,"" and we want to hear it repeated as often as the GOP states that entitlements must be done away with. If you were a working, taxpaying citizen for many years, you are entitled to benefits from your government.

The numbers bandied about in our federal budget debate are beyond comprehension to most people. Let's put it in perspective.

Congress has approved a $3.5-trillion budget for 2010. This includes a $1.6-trillion deficit, which amounts to 84 percent overspending. The Republicans were trying to cut $61 billion from the budget. This is a huge sum, but Democrats fought mightily to lower the amount of spending cuts to $38.5 billion.

Let's look at this from the perspective of a household. If your disposable income for this year is $75,000, and you spent the same proportionally as the federal government, you would spend $138,000. Most people realize that this would lead to financial ruination. So, you decide to cut $2,400 from your planned spending.

However, your spouse objects and, after a long argument, you agree to cut out $1,560. This is only $61,440 more than you take in.

Should you be proud of your fiscal restraint? Or should you call a bankruptcy lawyer?

Republican and tea party leaders are committing blatant fraud on the American people. If their alleged concern about reducing our budget deficits was even remotely genuine, they could do so with but three easy actions. Repeal the unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy, stop the shameful federal subsidies of oil companies and close all loopholes that permit American multinational corporations to avoid paying taxes at home.

The Republican and tea party proposals are squarely at the expense of the middle class and on down to the neediest citizens of our country.

A reader asks why federal funds should be sent to Planned Parenthood [Letters, April 10]. First, let's set the record straight.

The Pence amendment prohibits funding for Title X organizations that provide abortions, regardless of whether other federal funds are used by that organization for non-abortion health care services. Over the past 40 years, Title X organizations have provided contraceptive services and related counseling; breast and pelvic examinations; breast and cervical cancer screening; sexually transmitted disease and HIV prevention education, counseling, testing and referral; and pregnancy diagnosis and counseling.

This amendment clearly is an attack on women's health services. Without this funding, not only will abortions increase, but the health and welfare of tens of thousands of women will be jeopardized. Is that not a beneficial and justifiable use of our money?

NewsDay,Battling HIV/AIDS a mile at a time,"Richard Brodsky was living with HIV when doctors told him he had terminal brain cancer and only two years to live. Devastated, he made a promise to himself:

""If my life is spared, I will do everything to help others living with HIV and cancer, and the millions of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa.""

That was in 2002. Brodsky, 58, an architect, author and marathon runner from Atlantic Beach, survived. A year later, he finished the New York City Marathon ""in just five hours,"" less than two hours slower than his fastest marathon finish before his brain cancer diagnosis.

True to his promise, Brodsky, whose cancer was not related to his HIV, became the founder and president of the Richard M. Brodsky Foundation, launched in 2004 to help raise awareness that ""so many people need not die from AIDS every year.""

The foundation has so far sponsored seven fundraising World AIDS Day marathons, six of them in Kenya. It also has organized runs and walks in the United States to encourage people living with HIV or cancer to participate, and it donates money to many cancer and AIDS-related projects. The foundation will hold a 5k run / walk June 12 at Cedar Creek Park in Seaford.

""I believe running saved my life,"" Brodsky said, ""and I have access to the AIDS medicine and care and the loving support of my wife. So I wanted other people to get the benefit of running, and I want governments to get the AIDS medicine to people all over the world. When it comes down to it, we are our brothers' keepers, and it doesn't matter if the brother is in America or if the brother is in Africa.""

Brodsky is not alone in his quest to reduce the impact of AIDS in Africa. On May 2, Victoria Fanslow and Diane Gantenhammer, both 24 and friends since they attended Farmingdale High School, will embark on a one-month, 1,000-mile bike ride from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to San Francisco.

The ride, originally conceived as an adventure, is also a fundraising mission for Support for International Change, an organization fighting AIDS in Tanzania.

For most of the past 18 months, Fanslow, a pre-med graduate of Stanford University who lives in San Francisco, was a volunteer in rural Tanzania doing HIV education and testing and setting up chicken coops to give people with HIV a livelihood.

""I've been part of it, watching people who were scared of HIV learn they have a future; empowering people and giving them hope and confidence and support,"" she said.

Like Brodsky, Fanslow and Gantenhammer enjoy physical challenge. Both are world travelers and sports enthusiasts. Fanslow played tennis and varsity lacrosse in high school and loves climbing, snowboarding, running, hiking and biking. She's climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Kenya, rafted on the Nile and Zambezi rivers, and explored rain forests in Costa Rica.

Gantenhammer, of Chicago, ran track with Fanslow in high school and was captain of the soccer team at Wagner College on Staten Island.

The friends will be traveling together for the first time. They plan to ride about 50 miles a day and rest one day at friends' homes in major cities.

Challenges can be overcome

""The trip will test our mental and physical strength,"" Fanslow said, ""but I think Diane and I are pretty capable of handling any situation.""

Donations are being accepted at their website, bikeforchange. wordpress.com, which already has more than $1,000. Ninety percent of all donations will go to SIC; the rest will fund the ride.

Fanslow and Gantenhammer will pack raincoats, one change of clothing, sleeping bags and a two-person tent to pitch at campsites. They will stay in touch with friends and family via cell phone and a blog.

To prepare, the women are hiking, biking, running, working out in the gym and playing soccer. ""We're going to have fun,"" Gantenhammer said, ""and also raise money for a good cause.""",09/04/2011
NewsDay,Brave Libyan stands up against rape,"Mary Sanchez is an opinion-page columnist for The Kansas City Star.

You can read about it in the Bible, and it remains true to this very day. Rape is an integral part of war, a favored tactic to demoralize an enemy army or population.

Mass rape is never quite acknowledged in the glorious accounts of the victors, and the shame of it impels the defeated not to dwell on its memory. Often it is left to historians to dredge up its horrors, or to a handful of victims who demand justice. Only recently has rape in wartime become a topic for sustained discussion, much less systematic prosecution as a war crime.

But now there is Libya and Iman al-Obeidi.

Is her name unfamiliar? If you pay attention to the news on television, you might recognize her strained face and her anguished cries. She is the woman who last month was dragged out of a Tripoli hotel as she desperately tried to relay to international press the story of her kidnap and rape (and the kidnap and rape of numerous other Libyan women) by henchmen of Col. Moammar Gadhafi.

Despite the risks to her safety, Obeidi bravely made her way to the hotel to tell her story of being raped and sodomized by Libyan security forces. Cameras caught the scene as government thugs beat and kicked reporters who tried to protect Obeidi.

It seems she was picked up at a checkpoint because her accent gave her away as being from the east of Libya, the center of the rebellion against Gadhafi. ""Let the men from eastern Libya come and see what we are doing to their women and how we rape them,"" are the words Obeidi attributed to her attackers.

Broadcast around the world, the incident forced the Libyan government to follow a hackneyed script of denial and damage control. She's lying. She's a drunk, a thief. Then the inevitable: She's a prostitute. Libyan government operatives circulated a home video of a belly dancer, claiming the dancer was Obeidi and that the tape was a pornographic film.

Right. The world is not buying it.

The truth is that Obeidi is a law school graduate. She's also fortunate. Her well-timed outburst before international reporters quite possibly spared her life, and may spare her from the fate that awaits most Libyan women who are raped: being shuttered behind closed doors, sent to live in rehabilitation centers as if they were the criminal, not the victim. Obeidi is a symbol now.

Men have long been the main instigators of war, but women often bear its most gruesome scars. A 1996 UNICEF report, titled ""Sexual Violence as a Weapon of War,"" declared:

""From [recent] conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina to Peru to Rwanda, girls and women have been singled out for rape, imprisonment, torture and execution. Rape, identified by psychologists as the most intrusive of traumatic events, has been documented in many armed conflicts including those in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Cyprus, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.""

Rape has been used as a method of spreading HIV/AIDS, to contribute to ethnic cleansing and for human trafficking as women are forced into prostitution. And, yes, American GIs too have participated in this crime, most notably during the Vietnam War.

The striking thing about Obeidi is that she is not backing down. Nor is her family disowning her or accepting the dishonor that traditional societies impose on the victims of rape. The family reportedly has refused bribes offered in exchange for denouncing their daughter. She has refused bribes to implicate the rebels in her assault.

A troubling aspect of Obeidi's story is that there are others like her being detained and raped, whose names we don't know. One such victim is a 16-year-old girl Obeidi said helped free her by untying her hands. The girl, she said, was also sexually attacked but was fearful and far less willing to fight back or escape.

We can hope that the bravery of Iman al-Obeidi, and her dogged determination to use the media to expose the Libyan regime's atrocities, will help the world denounce rape as a crime of war.",08/04/2011
NewsDay,Long Island beekeepers help the planet,"If you'd told Paul Okula a year ago that he'd remain calm with a pack of 40-plus bees crawling all over his bare hands, he wouldn't have believed it.

""I was afraid of being stung,"" says Okula, an arborist from Manorville. ""Now, I don't worry about it.""

Okula is one of about 100 students learning the art of keeping hives with the Long Island Beekeepers Club. After two months of attending classes and making field trips with a master beekeeper, he's about to fly solo.

""I've read all the books, I think I'm ready,"" says Okula, 62. His first two colonies of bees are due to arrive any day by mail -- he'll introduce them to a pair of man-made wooden hives.

If all goes well, they'll be fairly self-sufficient -- minding the queen, gathering pollen and nectar -- and Okula will get to harvest 60 or so pounds of surplus honey and beeswax this summer.

Pretty sweet for a few hours' work.

ABOUT BEEKEEPING

The Long Island Beekeepers Club has been active for about 60 years, says president George Schramm. More than half of today's members are hobbyists who maintain three or fewer hives. While it takes time, money and logistics to get started, established hives require but an hour here and there from their keepers to stay healthy and productive, says Ray Lackey, of Bohemia, who has about 60 hives in Suffolk County.

Best Bets Get the scoop on events, nightlife, day trips, family fun and things to do on Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

He and fellow master keeper Rich Blohm of Huntington run group classes that meet monthly year-round to expose rookies to all stages of caring for a colony. Students can join at any time, but typically cycle through a full nine-month series before starting their own hive, Lackey says.

The perks of beekeeping extend beyond collecting pure honey, says Blohm, who -- ironically -- owns a pest-control business along with running about 50 hives. But bees, he says, aren't a nuisance.

""The whole environment benefits from having bees,"" says Blohm. The winged creatures pollinate at least a third of the world's food -- colonies placed near gardens and fruit orchards help the growth cycle along.

GETTING STARTED

Expect to spend $400 to $500 for protective gear, a wooden hive and a colony of live bees, Lackey says. Classes run $75 to $150 for a nine-month cycle.

One of the most important questions to answer early on is where you're going to set up your hive -- it can't necessarily be in your backyard, due to varying local ordinances.

Those who can't or don't want to keep their hives at home can get permission to host them on sites such as community gardens, farms, parks and preserves. The Long Island Beekeepers Club helps procure safe locations.

""With the increase in community gardens, we're hoping to put more hives on these sites,"" says Schramm.

The community garden in New Suffolk, which has doubled in size this year, is one of those hoping to connect with a willing beekeeper, says co-coordinator Shannon Simon.

DURING CLASS

Beekeeping classes involve time spent learning about the habits of bees, visits to an active colony for hands-on work inspecting and replenishing a hive.

""Once you learn about the bees, you're hooked,"" says Barbara Talbot, 43, of Cutchogue. The sales manager has been taking classes with Lackey and is planning to put a hive in her yard this year. She'll get help caring for them from her 13-year-old daughter, Emily, and her mother, Judy Kayton of Riverhead.

Says Talbot, ""There will be three generations of us taking care of our bees.""

NewsDay,Atlantic rower hangs up oars,"After a decade of training and three failed attempts to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat, Victor Mooney is calling it quits.

He has no regrets but thinks it's time to move on after being lost alone in a life raft for 14 days on the Atlantic amid gale-force winds and stormy weather, he said Thursday. Mooney, 45, of Forest Hills, had launched a 21-foot, high-tech boat off Cape Verde near the west coast of Africa on Feb. 26.

Before his voyage, Mooney had promised his wife this would be his last attempt to cross the ocean in an effort to raise money for AIDS medicine and awareness for AIDS testing. For him, this is personal: A brother died of AIDS, and a second brother has been diagnosed with HIV.

Mooney's two previous attempts ended in failure. In 2006, his self-made boat sank and he was rescued by the Senegalese navy. In 2009, Mooney ran out of drinking water and was rescued by a Spanish tuna boat. In his third attempt, Mooney's boat sprang a leak as soon as it was launched from the island of Sao Vicente off Cape Verde.

""A few minutes earlier the fishermen had waved goodbye, and I was still in eyesight of land when the boat started leaking. The current and wind was strong and it blew me westward,"" Mooney said Thursday. ""I immediately deployed the life raft. I never had a chance to row.""

On the second night of floating aimlessly on the life raft, Mooney spotted a ship and waved his flashlight. He said someone on the ship saw him, but didn't offer to help, leaving Mooney feeling abandoned. ""That was a turning point,"" he said. He sustained himself by drinking purified seawater and eating ginseng roots and herbal powder that his wife had packed for him.

This gave Mooney the will to live, he said.

""I couldn't accept seeing my family throw flowers into the ocean,"" said Mooney, the father of four children, who is now an unemployed office worker. At night as he floated over the sea, Mooney said he screamed and cried into the darkness, ""God is my fortune"" from Psalms 21 to keep his spirits up. He said the psalm goes on to say: ""God said: 'I will protect you and your home.' I took it literally.""

Mooney returned home on Sunday from Brazil, where he'd made land after he was plucked from the ocean by a Brazilian cargo ship. ""It was 14 days of solitude that came full circle,"" he said. ""This chapter has come to a close.""",07/04/2011

NewsDay,Fight over Planned Parenthood,"The fight over spending cuts that is threatening a shutdown of the federal government this week is an important debate over fiscal policy, but it must be an honest one.

Some new members of the House of Representatives are determined to defund Planned Parenthood. That's an ideological battle that has little to do with deficit reduction but a lot to do with their opposition to abortion.

The House has passed the Pence Amendment, which would ban federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Taking away its allotted $317 million would cripple the organization's ability to provide low-cost preventive health care, including cancer screenings, breast exams, contraceptives, and testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.

These are services that women from low-income households use, ones required under Title X of the Public Health Law, the nation's major program to reduce unintended pregnancies by providing contraceptive care. Without the nonprofit Planned Parenthood, which has more than 100 clinics nationwide with more than a dozen in New York, the taxpayer tab would be much higher.

For its opponents, however, Planned Parenthood is the enemy that must be eliminated, because it also provides abortions at some locations. Never mind that the long-standing Hyde amendment bars the use of federal funds for abortions.

The Pence Amendment would do little to stop abortions, but it certainly would stop the delivery of low-cost preventive care to women.",01/04/2011
NewsDay,Elizabeth Taylor buried near friend Michael Jackson,"Elizabeth Taylor’s family mourned the screen legend in a brief private funeral service Thursday at a California cemetery famous for being the final resting place of Hollywood celebrities, including her good friend Michael Jackson.

Inside the sprawling Forest Lawn Cemetery, barricades blocked access to the funeral, where about four dozen family members mourned the actress during a service that lasted about an hour, said Glendale police spokesman Tom Lorenz. Five black stretch limousines transported Taylor’s family to and from the funeral, but no procession was held.

Taylor died early Wednesday of congestive heart failure while surrounded by her four children at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she had been hospitalized for about six weeks.

Taylor, who was infamously married eight times to seven husbands, converted to Judaism before her 1959 wedding to Eddie Fisher. Jewish customs call for burial to take place as soon as possible.

In addition to Jackson, the cemetery is the final resting place for such stars as Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, W.C. Fields, Red Skelton, Gracie Allen, Walt Disney and Nat King Cole.

Taylor, the star of such films as “BUtterfield 8,” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “Cleopatra,” won three Academy Awards, including a special one for her humanitarian work. She was an ardent and early supporter of AIDS research, when HIV was new to the industry and beyond.

“I admired Elizabeth Taylor enormously and feel heartsick losing her, especially with all of her charitable works,” said Ann Berry, a fan and character actress who lives nearby and visited the cemetery with a friend to pay their respects to the star.

Several television news crews documented the service from across the street while news helicopters swirled overhead and students got out of class at the nearby Cerritos Elementary School.

Taylor underwent at least 20 major operations during her life and nearly died from a bout with pneumonia in 1990. In 1994 and 1995, she had both hip joints replaced, and in February 1997, she underwent surgery to remove a benign brain tumor. In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and pain killers, and was treated for alcohol and drug abuse.

Survivors include Taylor’s daughters Maria Burton-Carson and Liza Todd-Tivey, sons Christopher and Michael Wilding, 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.",24/03/2011

NewsDay,Our fascination with Liz Taylor,"In a fitting farewell, the Twitterati paid tribute to Elizabeth Taylor morning to night yesterday. They followed her like so many tabloids and scandal sheets did a half-century ago.

Taylor had the power, the magic, the image, the violet eyes and beauty to fascinate the public, to influence style, to affect social issues and be an artist at the same time.

Who else could play Cleopatra?

Taylor's private life received even more exposure than her films. Her affairs fed magazines and stuffed newspapers. They were part of the national conversation, from the time she ""stole"" Eddie Fisher from Debbie Reynolds to her tempestuous two marriages to Richard Burton.

Her troubles with her husbands, her weight and her health made international news, but also had a commonality with our own lives.

The headlines, however, often overshadowed her talent as well as her compassion. In the mid-1980s, Taylor was the first celebrity to recognize the HIV-AIDS crisis, and she challenged the entertainment community to fight the disease. Her enduring friendship with Michael Jackson gave her standing with another generation.

Decades from now, in media not yet discovered, the passing of a now-popular movie star may get comparable attention. Fascination with celebrity will endure. But in any cast of stars, Elizabeth Taylor will be remembered as the supernova.",23/03/2011

NewsDay,Kidney transplant gives patient AIDS,"The Associated Press

ATLANTA -- A transplant patient contracted AIDS from the kidney of a living donor in New York City, in the first documented case of its kind in the United States since screening for HIV began in the mid-1980s.

It turns out the donor had unprotected gay sex in the 11 weeks between the time he tested negative and when the surgery took place in 2009.

In a report yesterday on the case, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that organ donors have repeat HIV tests a week before surgery.

""The most sensitive test needs to be done as close as possible to the time of transplant,"" said Dr. Colin Shepard, who oversees tracking of HIV cases for the New York City Health Department.

The CDC also said would-be organ donors should be told to avoid behavior that can increase their chances of infection.

Living organ donors in the U.S. are routinely tested for infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. But the organization that oversees U.S. organ transplants does not have an explicit policy on when such screening is done. That's left up to transplant centers.

Because of patient confidentiality, health officials released no details about the donor, the recipient, their relationship or the hospital where the transplant took place, except to say that it is in New York. Neither the donor nor the recipient knew he or she had HIV until about a year after the transplant, the CDC report said.

Both now get treatment

The recipient developed AIDS, perhaps because he or she was on drugs that suppress the immune system to prevent organ rejection, health officials said. Both are receiving HIV treatment. Their conditions were not disclosed in the report.

""We don't know how frequently this is happening and we need better surveillance,"" said Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, a CDC official who co-wrote the report.

HIV infections in a donor or recipient may not be discovered until long after a transplant and, even then, patients and their doctors may not make the connection and report it, health officials said.

In this case, once health authorities were notified late last year, they spent months investigating whether the transplanted kidney was the source of the patient's infection. Genetic analysis of the virus confirmed investigators' suspicions.

At least one similar U.S. case has been reported in the media. Last year, an Orlando woman sued saying she was infected with HIV through a 2007 kidney transplant from a live donor in Florida. CDC officials said they have not been asked to investigate this case and could not confirm the report.

Italian doctors reported HIV transmission from a live organ donor in 1989.

Since the 1980s, there has been a confirmed report of a deceased donor's organs spreading the AIDS virus. That happened in Illinois in 2007, when organs from a 38-year-old gay man went to four recipients.

Use of live donors rises

For many years, transplant organizations focused heavily on screening organs taken from the dead, which accounted for the large majority of transplants.

Now, kidneys from live donors are becoming increasingly common. In 1988, about 32 percent of kidney transplants came from live donors. By last year, it was more than 46 percent, according to federal data. Donors generally are relatives or friends.

About 88,000 people are on the kidney waiting list now, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit that manages the nation's transplant system for the federal government. The group is developing new policies for live donors, spokesman Joel Newman said.",17/03/2011
NewsDay,NYC patient infected with AIDS by transplant,"ATLANTA - Health officials are reporting that a patient was infected with the AIDS virus through a kidney transplant from a live donor.

They are calling it the first confirmed instance of HIV spreading through an organ transplant from a live donor since routine laboratory screening of donors began in the 1980s.

It happened in New York City in 2009, but New York City health officials said Thursday that they only learned of the case late last year. The male donor had been tested for HIV about 10 weeks before he donated a kidney.

Health officials believe he was infected in the time between that test and the surgery. No other details about the donor or recipient were released. Health officials say both are alive and receiving HIV treatment.",17/03/2011
NewsDay,LI's former Peace Corps workers look back,"Fifty years ago, on March 1, 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps. Paul Arfin was a junior at Adelphi University.

""I was a business major and directionless. All my friends had clear goals, and I didn't know what I wanted,"" says Arfin, 70, of Hauppauge. ""So when I heard Kennedy's announcement, I applied.""

In 1965, armed with new skills such as how to shoe and ride horses, he headed for the mountains of Colombia, where he would organize a community market and theater. When he left, he was no longer directionless: ""I decided I wanted a career in social justice and community service work.""

Fast forward a few decades: Farhat Jilalbhoy, 25, a graduate of Smithtown High School, returned in May from a two-year stint in Costa Rica, where she taught life skills to at-risk youth and worked with a women's group to start an organic farming micro-enterprise.

""Now I use what I learned there every day,"" said Jilalbhoy, who now works at the nonprofit YouthBuild International in Boston.

The two bookend the experience of Peace Corps volunteers from Long Island, which has sent 4,010 abroad so far. Currently 122 Long Islanders are among the 8,655 volunteers working in 77 countries.

During the Peace Corps' half-century, more than 200,000 Americans have served. And much has changed.

""In 1961, education and agricultural support were the skills provided,"" said Vincent Wickes, New York regional director. Education still ranks high, at 37 percent ""of what the group does,"" he said, but agriculture has dropped to 4 percent. Now volunteers work with health and HIV/AIDS awareness (22 percent), business and information communication technology (14 percent), environment (13 percent) and youth development (5 percent).

In the early years, communication with the outside world meant using the mail.

""Where I was in the Philippines I was isolated from the world because there was no TV or radio,"" Linda Restaino-Merola, 65, of Eastport, said of her 27 months spent there. ""In 1968 when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, I learned about it by chance from someone who came by on a motorcycle.""

Peace Corps alumni interviewed said that their experiences left them wanting to give back to their communities -- and that they have tried to do so both through careers and volunteer activities.

When Arfin returned from Colombia in 1967, he began a career in nonprofit work and would go on to establish Long Island's first intergenerational day care centers and start the nonprofit Intergenerational Strategies, which promotes intergenerational programs and policies on Long Island.

As the Peace Corps has reached through generations, the alumni maintain connections through the Long Island affiliate of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, which has a membership of 200.

Among them:

Bette Bass, 66, was a high school student in Brooklyn when she heard Kennedy's 1961 call. Five years later she graduated from Brooklyn College, married and, with her husband, Bob, headed to Ethiopia, where they taught classes in the secondary school. They lived in a house with a tin roof and no indoor plumbing. ""It was a wonderful way to get to know your spouse,"" says Bass, of Massapequa.

Restaino-Merola, 65, left for the Philippines in 1967, three weeks after she graduated from the State University at New Paltz. She trained teachers and started a library.

""My father had a hard time with me going,"" said Restaino-Merola. ""He said, 'You went to college to make $60 a month?' ""

Sarah Lansdale, 36, executive director of Sustainable Long Island, went to Guatemala in 1996 as an agricultural extension agent, working with farmers to install irrigation and produce cash crops. Lansdale, of Huntington, says her father's military service inspired her to serve the country. She was also influenced by Peace Corps commercials:

""I still remember the image of people digging a well and the voice-over saying, 'The Peace Corps, the toughest job you'll ever love.' ""

Christina Lombardi, 31, of Lynbrook, joined in 2004, just nine months after graduation from Boston University, ""because I didn't want to change my mind. So many people say they wanted to do it but other things got in the way."" She was influenced by her parents and by Restaino-Merola, who had been her sixth-grade teacher.

Lombardi spent two years in Grenada as an HIV/AIDS health volunteer and survived two devastating hurricanes. ""That teaches you to be creative in order to get jobs done. And that has helped me with my career,"" she says. She's a speech occupational therapist at AHRC Nassau's Barbara C. Wilson Preschool in Woodbury.

The local group assists returning volunteers. ""They were in touch with me and supported my family while I was in the service and when I came back,"" says Lombardi. ""The reverse culture shock is intense. You see so much that people at home may never see, and then you're thrown back into the New York pace.

""The RPCV group understands that, so they help you to talk about your stories and adjust.""

The group also does speaking engagements and performs service projects such as Pedals for Progress, which each April takes unwanted bicycles and parts and ships them to developing nations.

""A lot of what we do is to meet the third goal of the Peace Corps, which is to bring the world back home to make people aware of other cultures,"" said Restaino-Merola, who taught reading for 31 years at Selden Middle School. Bass said she spent years volunteering with Cub Scouts, the PTA and other community groups and worked several years as a special education paraprofessional. Today she's a naturalist and outdoor educator at the Nassau BOCES Outdoor and Environmental Education Site at Brookville.

In her seven years as executive director of Sustainable Long Island in Bethpage, Lansdale said she has used her Peace Corps experience to encourage community leaders and elected officials to ""rethink, rebuild and renew communities across Long Island.""

She draws a parallel with her work in the Peace Corps: ""There, as here, I worked with communities to identify their needs and imagine what that future world could look like.""

Jilalbhoy said she grew up visiting India and was moved ""by the poverty people experienced. I wanted to work on a grassroots level to do something about it.""

She believes her Peace Corps experience will have a lifelong impact. ""I did not change the world during my service, and nothing came easily,"" she says. ""But now when I come across a challenge, I remind myself of what my community and I were able to achieve with those tools and feel confident in my ability to overcome whatever obstacle is in my way.""

NewsDay,HIV gene therapy stirs hope of future cure,"In a bold new approach aimed ultimately at trying to cure AIDS, scientists used genetic engineering in six patients to develop blood cells that are resistant to HIV, the virus that causes the disease.

It's far too early to know whether this scientific first will prove to be a cure, or even a new treatment. The research shows, so far, it seems feasible and safe.

The concept was based on the case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. A more practical way is sought to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.

The results announced yesterday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.

""For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure"" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - ""what is called a functional cure,"" he said.

It's the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts have not worked against HIV.

The virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells, usually entering the cells through a protein receptor, or ""docking station,"" called CCR5.

Some people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.

The cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.

So scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?

Dr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of it. He cautioned that it would be ""way overstated"" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.",28/02/2011
NewsDay,Man starts attempt to row across Atlantic,"He's at it again.

Victor Mooney, 45 and a Freeport native, embarked Saturday morning on his third attempt to navigate the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat.

Mooney hopes to row from Cape Verde - off the coast of West Africa - to New York harbor, a trip that could take six to eight months. Mooney, who now lives in Queens, said he was trying to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS.

""For every stroke I make towards New York's Brooklyn Bridge, I hope someone can get tested for HIV/AIDS and into treatment if necessary,"" he said on a website about his voyage.

Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone from the island of Sao Vicente on Thursday, Mooney said he was ready for the nearly 5,000-mile trek.

""We did some test runs,"" he told the AP. ""All the electrical systems are OK. I'm enjoying these last minutes.""

There will be no fourth attempt, he said.

""That was the deal with my wife,"" said Mooney, on leave from his job as a publicist at the ASA Institute of Business and Computer Technology, which has offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn. ""She said, 'Victor, this is it. Write it down. This is a family contract.' ""

Mooney said he might not make it all the way home; merely crossing to an island like Antigua is a journey of 2,500 miles.

""I would prefer to go all the way to New York,"" he told the AP.",26/02/2011
NewsDay,Taking CARE against food allergies,"What terrifies Victoria Segal is her belief that when most people think about allergies, they think ""achoo"" and not life-threatening anaphylactic shock.

But for Segal's third-grade daughter, Julia, who is 9, and for millions of other children who have severe allergies to common foods such as peanuts, exposure to the allergen can cause trouble breathing, a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure, and, in the worst case, death.

So Segal leaped when she had the chance to apply for a grant that would bring to Long Island the vice president and the chief executive of one of the nation's biggest nonprofits that educates and advocates for people with allergies. On Tuesday, Maria Acebal and Julia Bradsher of the Fairfax, Va.-based Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network will be in Huntington offering an educational program to the public - including PTA members, nurses and teachers from other school districts as well as any interested parent - in English one night and in Spanish on another.

Even if parents don't have a child with an allergy, chances are they will encounter one in their child's class, soccer team or when hosting a birthday party. ""Having an understanding of this is doing a valuable service to those who are affected,"" Segal says.

What the presentation covers

The organization's experts do a 45-minute to one-hour presentation followed by audience questions that focus on the acronym CARE, Acebal says.

C is for comprehending the medical fact that the tiniest amount of food can cause a reaction and that the reaction usually happens two minutes after exposure but can occur up to two hours after exposure. Therefore, every teacher - from the art class to the playground - needs to know if a child is susceptible.

A is for avoiding the allergen, teaching about food ingredient labels, washing hands and surfaces and educating parents of other children in a classroom when one child has an allergy, so they don't send in dangerous foods. Schools often focus on the peanut allergy, because statistically it is most often associated with the reactions that end in death, Acebal says. It's also, because of the nature of peanut butter itself, one of the most difficult to control - it's very sticky and it stays on hands and tables, she says.

R is for recognizing a reaction, which can also include hives, vomiting or diarrhea.

And E is for knowing how to react in an emergency - about calling 911 and administering an EpiPen, which contains the drug epinephrine.

Outreach to the Hispanic community

Segal is especially excited about the presentation being offered in Spanish. Both Segal's daughters - Julia and Sophia, who is 5 and in kindergarten, are enrolled in the Huntington school district's Dual Language program. Segal says she has encountered students from Latino families who have allergies whose parents aren't as familiar with how the school system can protect their children.

Segal recommends that all parents who find out their children have a food allergy create an action plan with the school, working with a core team of the principal, nurse, classroom teachers and lunch aides and learning what the school's policy is on checking food brought in for parties and other occasions.

""There are kids for whom school can be life-threatening if the people who are with them all day are not educated on how to take a little extra care and keep them safe,"" says Lisa Cahn of Huntington, whose son Jack, 5, is allergic to sesame seeds, tree nuts, peanuts and more.

WHAT: Safe@School allergy awareness programs

WHEN WHERE: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, March 1, in English at Huntington High School, Oakwood and McKay roads, and 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 2, in Spanish at the Jefferson Primary School, Oakwood Road, Huntington

Making safe treats at home

Here are some cookbooks with recipes for treats kids with allergies can enjoy:

For kids with gluten allergies and intolerance:

""The Ultimate Gluten-Free Cookie Book"" by Roben Ryberg (Da Capo Long Life, $16.95). Gluten-free baking can be frustrating because gluten is the protein that holds the dough together. Most of the cookies use brown rice flour or sorghum; no complicated rice blends are required. Ryberg, author of several gluten-free cookbooks, also offers egg- and dairy-free cookies and recipes with single flours.

Nut-, egg- and dairy-free recipes: ""The Food Allergy Mama's Baking Book"" by Kelly Rudnicki (Agate Surrey, $19.95); foodallergy mama.com. Rudnicki offers advice on how to deal with classroom festivities and birthday parties.

Multiple allergens: ""My Kid's Allergic to Everything Dessert Cookbook"" by Mary Harris and Wilma Selzer Nachsin (Chicago Review Press, $16.95); mykidsallergictoeverything.com. More than 100 recipes for sweets; the book also has recipes for those who must limit sugar intake or avoid gluten. --Chicago Tribune",22/02/2011
NewsDay,Hepatitis C crisis spikes on LI,"An estimated 44,000 people on Long Island are infected with hepatitis C and seven out of 10 don't even know it.

Experts gathered Thursday to address the public health crisis blamed a rise in intravenous drug use, tattooing and body piercing for a dramatic spike in infection rates among young adults.

For aging baby boomers, infections that have smoldered for decades are now resulting in cirrhosis or full-blown liver failure, the experts said.

New York State epidemiologists predicted the trend three years ago, but the medical and social service impacts on Long Island are only now being felt - with health officials saying they are overwhelmed and underfunded.

Nassau and Suffolk counties rank behind New York City, where 129,000 people are believed to be carrying the virus.

Dr. David Bernstein, who heads the division of liver diseases at North Shore/LIJ Health System in Manhasset, said the surge in hepatitis C cases has forced him to screen a wider group of people.

""I screen everyone with a tattoo and everyone with body piercings,"" said Bernstein, whose research shows that one-third of the U.S. population younger than 30 has a tattoo.

The situation was presented during the inaugural meeting in Lindenhurst of the Long Island Regional hepatitis C Task Force - a consortium of health care and advocacy organizations.

""Hepatitis C dwarfs the number of people with other bloodborne viral diseases,"" Bernstein said, referring to HIV and hepatitis B.

He emphasized that hepatitis C is the only curable bloodborne viral disease, but many people don't know they're infected.

The estimate that 33,000 Long Islanders have no idea they are infected is based on epidemiologic projections that take into account the rate at which infections have been confirmed in recent years.

Shari Foster, director of Status C Unknown, a Medford-based nonprofit that advocates for people with hepatitis C, said she is concerned about Suffolk's treatment resources for some.

For those who are underinsured or uninsured, she said, few centers outside of Stony Brook University Medical Center offer treatment services, adding that Suffolk's lack of resources has become critical.

Foster noted that in New York State, ""Suffolk County has the highest rate of hepatitis C outside of New York City.""

But the state health department, which has funds for hepatitis C screening and treatment, says because it's a disease that by state mandate requires each case be reported, the department - with a statewide budget of just $1.19 million - can't keep up with the workload.

""We don't have the manpower or the resources to follow up on every single laboratory report we receive,"" said Colleen Flanigan, a registered nurse and viral hepatitis coordinator at the health department in Albany.

At the task force meeting, Flanigan outlined New York's Viral Hepatitis Strategic Plan, which calls for increased screening and education programs.

Projections three years ago indicated hepatitis C cases would rise through 2015, driving a 528 percent jump in the need for liver transplants and a 223 percent increase in liver-related deaths in New York.

Across the state, an estimated one in 24 people carries the virus, accounting for more than 325,000 infections. Nationally, 3.5 million people are infected.



About hepatitis C

Hepatitis C is an infection that attacks the liver and initially may produce only vague flu-like symptoms.

Only a minority of people during the early phase of infection have symptoms, which may last weeks to months. Symptoms include:

NewsDay,WHO: 4 percent of deaths by alcohol abuse,"GENEVA - Alcohol abuse is killing 2.5 million people each year and governments must do more to prevent it, the World Health Organization said Friday.

Some 4 percent of all deaths worldwide are attributable to alcohol, the UN body said, greater than the rate caused by HIV/AIDS, violence or tuberculosis.

The main causes of alcohol-related deaths are cancer, cirrhosis, heart disease, stroke and injuries incurred while drunk.

""It's a killer and it's not good from a public health point of view,"" Melvin Freeman of South Africa's Ministry of Health and a contributor to the report, told reporters in Geneva.

Worldwide, more than 6 percent of male deaths are related to alcohol, but only just over 1 percent of deaths in women.

Almost one in 10 deaths among young people ages 15 to 29 is from alcohol-related causes - about 320,000 each year - WHO said.

The global body's first report on the subject in seven years recommended that governments raise alcohol taxes, restrict sales, promote alcoholism prevention and treatment programs, and ban some alcohol advertising.

WHO declined to provide a specific recommendation on the acceptable limit of alcohol consumption, saying setting such a level was up to member states.

Shekhar Saxena, the director of WHO's mental health and substance abuse department, said the effects of alcohol use also differ in ethnic groups.

Populations in Asia, for example, are more susceptible to throat cancer from alcohol abuse.

But he added ""in WHO's perspective, no drinking is entirely safe.""

NewsDay,Gramercy: Beyond the park,"Gramercy is no walk in the park.

That, of course, refers to the gated oasis — the only private park in Manhattan — accessible by no one but the key-holding residents who live on its perimeter.

Years ago, the serene neighborhood was home to a who’s who of New York literati. Edith Wharton was born at 80 E. 21st St. Herman Melville, after the critical and commercial failure of “Moby-Dick,” lived at 150 E. 18th St. before retreating to East 26th Street, where he lived until his death in 1891. O. Henry, pen name of Williams Sydney Porter, the popular and prolific short-story writer, moved to 55 Irving Pl. in 1903, a year after arriving in the city after his release from an Ohio prison.

The residents now are more likely to be families. Arlene Harrison, founder and president of the Gramercy Block Association, has seen a number of young families move into the area in the past 15 years.

“When I was raising my sons here 30 years ago, there were only a few families with children,” she said. These days, the block association, which boasts 2,000 members, counts 300 families among them.

While the area near the park is home to past and present boldface names — everyone from Oscar Wilde to Winona Ryder have lived there — a grittier bohemian spirit echoes a few blocks east around Stuyvesant Square. Downtown club kids and wild personalities once resided at nearby Hotel 17.

The glamorous creation known as Amanda Lepore, a nightlife fixture, still claims one of the rooms, but the rest of the hotel’s down-and-out charm is now only available to tourists for short-term stays.

The stretch of Park Avenue that runs from 14th to 23rd streets has an incredible number of options — but it’s all the same food you could find elsewhere. We suggest dropping in on Irving Place, or exploring the avenues farther east.

Pete’s Tavern, 129 E. 18th St.,212-473-7676



This bar has been used as a set location for a number of films and TV shows, and hundreds of celebrity snapshots hang from the walls. O. Henry wrote “Gift of the Magi” in one of the black-lacquered booths. And the “Oldest Continuously Operating Bar & Restaurant in New York City” serves a surprisingly fresh weekend brunch. At $9.95, cocktail included, it’s also the cheapest deal around.

71 Irving Place Coffee & Tea Bar, 71 Irving Pl., 212-995-5252

This little outpost, founded 15 years ago, roasts its own coffee at an upstate farm. The cafe may be a tight squeeze among the students, scribblers and chic young moms — but that rich, soothing Cuban cortadito (espresso with steamed milk, served in a shot glass) is worth the trouble.

Ponty Bistro, 218 Third Ave., 212-777-1616

“It’s French. It’s African. It’s just terrific. And it’s become everyone’s favorite spot,” said Arlene Harrison, the block association president. She recommends the chicken tajine. But be sure to try the Niokolokoba — the signature dish, which is a grilled sirloin steak marinated with spices and a black peppercorn sauce.

To shop

Housing Works Thrift Shop, 157 E. 23rd St., 212-529-5955

We’re a nonprofit benefiting the homeless and people affected by HIV or AIDS,” said Lark Redding, sales associate. Proceeds from the store fund job-training programs, medical facilities and housing. A recent visit to the shop turned up a pristine white enamel worktable ($110) and a blond armoire hutch ($120).

Lomography, 106 E. 23rd St., 212-260-0240

Put away your iPhone and pick up one of the retro beauties at this camera and film shop. The store, which opened two months ago, offers weekend workshops and guided photo field trips of the area. Class prices range from free to $10, which includes camera loan and a roll of film.

Bruno the King of Ravioli, 235 E. 22nd St., 212-685-7666; 282 First Ave. (btwn. 16th and 17th sts.), 212-254-2156

Started in 1905 by Italian immigrant Bruno Cavalli, this fresh pasta outlet has three stores in the city, with two in the neighborhood. The flagship location on First Avenue, bordering Stuyvesant Town, has a full-service deli, grab-and-go items, and serves up meals throughout the day in the 40-seat dining area. But you can still buy a box of 40-count ravioli with fillings that range from the old-world standard ricotta cheese to the health-conscious tofu and spinach. Prices range from $5.99 to $10.99.

To play

There’s a steady, nocturnal migration of khaki-clad border crossers from Murray Hill, but mostly celebs have taken over the district’s nightlife. Maybe five years ago, a regular girl could lounge at the Gramercy Park Hotel rooftop and get her foot stepped on by Moby, but one former resident said the hotel’s redo by Ian Schrager in 2005 ushered in an era of A-list elitism.

The Rose Bar, Gramercy Park Hotel, 2 Lexington Ave.



You thought getting into the park was difficult? This spot — where Madonna, among others, hangs out — has so little interest in ordinary folks (that’s you and me) that you must request a reservation via e-mail if you want a drink after 9 p.m. They’ll get back to you if they can accommodate you (rosebar@gramercyparkhotel.com).

Molly’s Shebeen, 287 Third Ave., 212-889-3361

A bar first put down stakes here in 1895. It survived Prohibition by posing as a grocery, and in 1964 was made over in its current style and named Molly Malone’s. Twenty years ago, it was renamed Molly’s Shebeen. “A shebeen is an illegal drinking space, an after-hours, a speakeasy,” said a manager on duty. The bar continues to be a favorite among Irish-American locals.

To do

National Arts Club, 15 Gramercy Park South, 212-477-2389

The gorgeous sandstone façade of this mansion is worth a look. Built in the 1840s, and redone in the 1860s, it wasn’t until 1906 that the place became home to the National Arts Club, a private club with a mission to “foster and promote public interest in the arts.” Formed in 1898 by a literary and art critic at The New York Times, early members included Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. According to the club’s website, Martin Scorsese, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman are members.

The Players, 16 Gramercy Park South, 212-475-6116

This equally historic — and just as exclusive — club was established in 1888 by Edwin Booth, the acclaimed Shakespearean actor of his day and brother of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth. A statue of Edwin acts as the centerpiece of Gramercy Park. Past “Players” have included Mark Twain and Carol Burnett. At the club earlier last month, Kevin Spacey was presented the Edwin Booth Lifetime Achievement Award.

Theodore Roosevelt’s Birthplace, 28 E. 20th St., 212-260-1616

Roosevelt is the only U.S. president born in New York City, and his rebuilt childhood home — a National Historic Site run by the National Park Service — is open to the public for free tours. Hours: Tue-Sat, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.

Daryl Roth Theater, 101 E. 15th St., 212-375-1110

This former savings bank, a landmark building from the 1840s, is home to a range of theatrical offerings. “Fuerza Bruta,” the loud, water- and confetti-filled extravaganza of sexy athleticism, is the latest production from the creators of “De La Guarda,” which ran at the theater for seven years. For the younger set, there’s the musical “Dear Edwina,” about a pre-adolescent Dear Abby who doles out advice in song, which plays at the annex DR2 until Feb 25.

Arlene Harrison, a park trustee and self-described unofficial mayor of Gramercy Park, unlocks the mystery about those storied keys.

For instance, the price for one isn’t the crazy sum you may have heard — unless, of course, you lose it.

How many keys are in circulation? There are a couple hundred out. They’re only given to lot-owner buildings. Those are the buildings on the original plots of land that [Samuel] Ruggles set up in 1831. And there are 39 lot-owner buildings ... [Buildings, depending on their size, comprise between one and four lots each.] They’re all residential except one commercial building, which is the Gramercy Park Hotel. There are two keys per lot.

How much for a key? If you live in a lot-owner building, you’re allowed to purchase one key for your unit and it’s $350. If you lose your key, it’s $1,000 for another one. But people tend not to lose it. And then it’s $2,000. And then it’s $4,000.

What draws people here? It’s a wonderful family neighborhood. We do loads of community service. It’s a very close-knit community.



How long have you been here? Thirty-nine years. I live in the oldest co-op in New York. It was built in 1883.",02/02/2011

I spent some time with bees last summer and I absolutely loved them. Though it may seem stressful, having all those bees buzzing around your head actually makes you feel peaceful. They're not the angry little dangerous critters they're made out to be. Bees are live-and-let-live-type creatures that only attack when they feel threatened.

You can learn all about beekeeping at the Long Island Beekeeping Club's Novice Beekeeping Classes, which will be held one evening a month from February through November in Holtsville, Centereach, Saint James and Riverhead.

NewsDay,LI mom: I’m food allergies’ ‘Erin Brockovich’,"Huntington’s Victoria Segal refers to herself as the “Erin Brockovich of food allergies.”

Nothing could bring out that passion more than having a child who could die from consuming just one wrong goodie.

Segal’s 9-year-old daughter Julia was diagnosed with an egg allergy at 10 months old. Then, at the age of 2, Julia put a pistachio in her mouth, and her eyes began to swell.

“She had outgrown the egg allergy, and the doctor diagnosed her with a tree-nut allergy,” Segal said. “When you have a child with food allergies, you want to keep them safe, and education is an important part of doing so.”

Concerned about Julia, a student at Jefferson Elementary School, Segal contacted the Virginia-based Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN). She met the organization’s chief executive, Julia Bradsher, at a FAAN Walk in Eisenhower Park last year, and they quickly hit it off.

They now work together through FAAN’s Safe at School Program, which helps schools be food-allergy smart.

“I want people to know and understand that a food allergy can be life-threatening,” said Segal, noting that Julia is especially at risk because she also suffers from asthma.

A food allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks a food protein. Symptoms for food allergies can be mild (rashes, hives, itching, swelling) or severe (trouble breathing, wheezing, loss of consciousness). Scientists estimate that approximately 12 million Americans suffer from the condition, making Jefferson Elementary principal Margaret Evers especially appreciative of Segal’s work.

""We are grateful to have the additional resources,"" Evers said.

The effort extends to Huntington High School March 1 and 2, when food allergy presentations will be given in English and Spanish.

“Food allergies cross all races and language barriers,” Segal said.

Segal wants to extend the program to all of Long Island, and is also writing a book titled “The Food Allergy Mom's Silver Bullet,” a how-to guide for keeping your child safe at school.

“When you believe strongly enough in something,” Segal says, “don’t give up.”

NewsDay,Air Force Sgt. convicted in HIV sex case,"An Air Force sergeant convicted of exposing multiple sex partners to HIV at swinger parties has been sentenced to eight years in military prison and will be dishonorably discharged.

A court martial judge found Tech. Sgt. David Gutierrez guilty Wednesday of aggravated assault and violating his commander’s order to notify partners about his HIV status and use condoms.

Lt. Col. William Muldoon delivered the sentence after a brief hearing. The airman had begged a judge not to discharge him so he could keep his military medical benefits.

The defense of the sexually promiscuous Air Force sergeant rested Wednesday without putting on a witness.

“The accused knew he was putting these people in danger,” Capt. Brian Mason said during the prosecution’s closing arguments. The prosecution told Lt. Col. William Muldoon, the military judge presiding over the case, that Gutierrez was counseled six times during his medical treatment about the risks of transmitting the deadly virus.

“None of that stopped him — not counseling, not treatment, not an order,” Mason said. “He needs to be held accountable.” In closing arguments, defense attorney Maj. James Dorman recalled the testimony of Dr. Donna Sweet, who said her examination of his medical records showed a low viral count and low risk of transmission. “The risk is so low it can’t rise to the level of being aggravated assault under these facts,” Dorman told the judge.

Dorman also argued in his closing that medical treatment for those with HIV has advanced such that they can lead a fairly normal life, comparable to those with diabetes. “He has made some mistakes and there are things here he probably wishes he had not done,” Dorman said.

Several people who participated in swinger and partner-swapping events with Gutierrez and his wife say they never would have had sex with the man had he told them he was HIV positive.

When asked by potential partners, Gutierrez repeatedly denied he was infected, and his wife encouraged him to carry on with his promiscuous lifestyle, several witnesses testified Tuesday, during the first day of the airman’s court martial at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita.

“I watched a brother die of AIDS. It wouldn’t have happened,” a Topeka woman testified Tuesday about her decision to have unprotected sex with Gutierrez on multiple occasions. She said she had asked him whether he had any sexually transmitted diseases and he assured her he “was clean.” The Associated Press is not naming the airman’s sexual partners because they are alleged victims of a sexual crimes.

Gutierrez was originally charged with 10 counts of aggravated assault and with violating his squadron commander’s order to notify partners about his HIV status and use condoms. The judge granted a prosecution request to drop two of the assault counts and one of the adultery counts Wednesday, but other charges remain — including a count for multiple acts of indecent acts, having sex in front of others, and eight remaining counts of adultery.

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The Topeka woman was one of several witnesses to testify that Gutierrez’s wife also was an active swinger and at times set up partner swaps.

“She was talking about opening a bed-and-breakfast for swingers,” the woman said. “She was all for it.” During opening statements, defense attorney Capt. Aaron Mannes had asked the judge to note the conduct of Gutierriez’s wife when considering the adultery charges.

In cross examination of prosecution witnesses, defense attorneys emphasized that none of them had been infected with HIV and that during many of the encounters they described, Gutierrez either used a condom or did not ejaculate. On Tuesday, a Wichita man who said he participated in swinger events with the couple also testified that Gutierrez flatly denied being HIV positive.

“What he did was wrong,” the man said. A Wichita woman testified that she and her partner met Gutierrez on an adult website and later had dinner at his house, where she said the airman’s wife asked the couple, “Do you want to have dessert or do you want to play?”

Gutierrez’s wife is not in the military and has not been charged with any crime. Capt. Sam Kidd, who is prosecuting the case, said during opening statements that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting the community from service members spreading a life-threatening disease. Gutierrez’s commander, Maj. Christopher Hague, testified that after learning about the airman’s HIV status, he personally gave Gutierrez a written order in October 2009 requiring him to use condoms and notify his sexual partners of his HIV status before engaging in sex.

Under military law, Gutierrez, who is stationed at McConnell base with the 22nd Maintenance Operations Squadron, could face more than 53 years in prison if convicted on all charges.

Other penalties include a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of pay and reduction in rank.",19/01/2011
NewsDay,Learn beekeeping from experts,"Over the summer, I delved into the world of beekeeping. Even put on a bee suit and got up close and personal with the adorable little pollinators (watch the video here). What a trip! Though I always had an appreciation and deep respect for the job these worker bees do for us -- not to mention the honey they produce -- the experience awakened a real desire to become a beekeeper in my next life, which will begin whenever Oyster Bay changes the law and allows it. Right now, no towns in Nassau County permit backyard beekeeping, but if you live in Suffolk, odds are your town may allow it, like NYC does.

Rooftop beekeeping in the city has been gaining in popularity, and now Wave Hill, the public garden in the Bronx, is offering a workshop to get more urbanites into the hobby. But you don't have to live in the city to attend.

Bronx beekeepers Roger Repohl and Sara Katz will teach you everything you need to know about starting your own hive -- equipment requirements, start-up costs and where to obtain bees. The workshop will run Saturday, Jan. 29, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and costs $30 ($25 for members). Registration is required and can be handled on the wavehill.org website or by calling 718-549-3200, ext. 305.",04/01/2011
NewsDay,LI women in Africa to give peace a chance,"Back from a two-week trip to Africa, a group of seven women - five from Long Island - say that of all their experiences on the journey, one of the most remarkable occurred in Rwanda. There, in the land devastated by genocide in 1994, they learned a lesson in forgiveness.

""I didn't think it was possible for someone from a former Hutu, Tutsi or Batwa tribe to live next door to a neighbor responsible for the death of their loved ones,"" said Priscilla Hernandez of Manhattan.

In the fall, the women visited villages, built since the genocide, where residents told them it was common for people who had killed to live next to families of people who had been killed. The residents now consider themselves Rwandans instead of tribal members, they said.

The travelers use the word Amahoro - which means ""peace"" in the Rwandan language of Kinyarwanda - to describe themselves. In addition to Hernandez, the group included Oceanside residents Norma Loeb and Eileen Ilardo, Kathleen Casserly of Huntington, Chris Clarke of Lake Ronkonkoma, Liz Gannon-Graydon of West Hempstead and Marie Goretti Ukeye, a native Rwandan who lives in Queens.

The women - who met in 2006 when they were involved with the nonprofit organization Department of Peace, which promotes nonviolent conflict resolution - said the journey was the first of what they expect to be many. They were intent on finding out what needs to be done by asking: ""What does 'better' look like for you?"" Their goal now is to determine what can be achieved in Rwanda and to bring awareness to the plight of women in the Congo.

Both countries are home to thousands of refugees who fled the 1994 genocide, which resulted in 800,000 deaths.

""We concentrated efforts in the Congo and Nyrguanga Village on the outskirts of Kigali [Rwanda],"" where many Rwandans are HIV-infected widows and child-headed households in need of assistance, said Casserly, 57, a counselor at Farmingdale State College.

The travelers distributed clothing, shoes and soccer balls for children and helped with ""community day,"" the last Saturday of each month, when village neighbors repair roads and plant trees.

They also visited the Imbabazi orphanage, home to 400 children, where, they said, the children danced and joined the women in song.

The women will be paying the college tuition for four Rwandans: two 23-year-old women, each an orphan who serves as the sole support of her siblings and who plan to study business management at a local university, and two men studying information technology.

The group donated money to the Heal Africa medical center in Goma for supplies and to Nyrguanga to provide food for 60 families and to fix the leaking roof of a home there.

In what they described as an emotional visit, Casserly and Loeb met two Rwandan women, Pauline and Rose, whom they had supported for a year with monthly donations through Women for Women International, an organization that helps women in war-torn countries rebuild their lives. The money was designated to help the women learn how to care for themselves and their families. They also learn skills such as driving, sewing and planting seeds for crops that can be sold.

Ukeye, 42, who has been in America for 12 years, said she was a medical student when the genocide began. Unable to finish her studies, she sought asylum in the United States and recently became a citizen.

""My 'better' looks like focusing on the women in Rwanda,"" said Ukeye, an executive assistant at Zurich Financial Services in Manhattan who lives in Jamaica Estates with her husband and two children. ""If you focus on the women, then families come along, and then the whole country. I would love for them to have a job to support themselves.""

Ilardo, a dental hygienist who lives in Oceanside, saw a young orphan who had a broken tooth that needed treatment. She met with a dentist in Nyarutarama, a new suburb of Kigali, and asked him to offer his services, free of charge, to the children in the Imbabazi Orphanage.

He agreed.

""We are more motivated than ever now to help,"" said Loeb, 57, of Oceanside, an executive assistant at The New York Times Co. She said the women are determined ""to raise awareness and bring hope to the Congolese and Rwandan women that the world has not forgotten them.""

The women are sharing their experience on the website whatbetter

NewsDay,LI beekeeper 'in shock' over mass killing,"Mary Woltz of Sag Harbor has dedicated the past seven years of her life to the care of bees, whose honey she sells at farmers' markets on the East End.

So Woltz, 50, was ""in shock"" earlier this month when she went to the East End Community Organic Farm in East Hampton and discovered up to 50,000 honeybees that she keeps on a small patch of land at the 42-acre farm were dead, deliberately killed by someone who poured a toxic liquid into their hive and then closed the hive so they could not escape.

""It was just a sick and deranged act,"" Woltz, a well-known commercial beekeeper on the East End, said Saturday. ""If somebody had something against me, the worst possible thing they could do is harm my bees. I can't think of anything that could hurt more.""

East Hampton town police have received a report about the incident, but said Saturdaythat they had no new information about the death of the bees. Woltz says there is an average of 50 pounds of honey per bee hive.

Woltz, originally from North Carolina, owns a Sag Harbor-based company, Bees' Needs, that sells honey at the Sag Harbor Farmers Market on weekends. She has about 100 bee colonies around the East End, mostly on the South Shore.

At the East End Community Organic Farm, Woltz keeps her bees in four hives in a 20-by-20-foot stockade enclosure. The perpetrator knew something about bees, Woltz says. He or she knew enough to open the hives, pour the liquid in, and then close the hives' entrances so the bees were trapped. The incident is even more puzzling because the bees would have died in the spring, she said.

""This wasn't just dumb, vindictive vandalism,"" said Peter Garnham, chairman of the organic farm's board of directors. ""Someone would have had to know where they are. Most of our gardeners don't know where they are.""

Woltz said she checks her hives every couple of weeks. She discovered the dead bees Dec. 13.

""I kept smelling gasoline when I went out there,"" she said. ""I shouldn't have been smelling gasoline."" Gasoline is sometimes used to kill diseased bees, but these bees had no disease, Garnham said.

In years past, Woltz has minded sheep and cattle in Australia, managed a garden in France and designed baskets that were produced in Haiti. Seven years ago, she was managing a garden at the organic Pfeiffer Center in Chestnut Ridge, N.Y. She heard about the ever-widening danger to bees from two species of parasitic mites, the tracheal and the varroa, that destroy bee colonies.

""I decided to dedicate my life to working with bees,"" Woltz said. ""They are so essential to life on Earth. The bees are matchmakers for the flowers.""",25/12/2010
NewsDay,"Police investigate killing of 50,000 bees","In what master gardener Peter Garnham calls an ""unthinkable"" and ""senseless"" act of vandalism, someone used a toxic liquid to kill up to 50,000 honeybees that were wintering over at the East End Cooperative Organic Farm in East Hampton.

The dead bees, in four hives on the 42-acre farm, were discovered Dec. 13 by beekeeper Mary Woltz, and the incident was reported to East Hampton town police, Garnham said Friday. Woltz could not be reached for comment.

Garnham, who is chairman of the farm's board of directors and a former beekeeper himself, said the liquid used was believed to be gasoline.

Whoever committed the act knew enough about beekeeping to open the hives, pour the liquid in and then close the hives' entrances so the bees could not get out, he said.

Police confirmed a complaint was filed. The detective on the case could not be reached Friday.

""Any sort of explanation you come up is a real stretch,"" Garnham said. ""To knock out a rival doesn't fit. People who keep bees love bees. It's unthinkable for another beekeeper to do this. It's like fratricide. It's awful.""

Gasoline sometimes is used to kill diseased bees, Garnham said, but these honeybees had no disease.

The farm's board is considering offering a reward to anyone who has information about the incident, he said.

The four hives were situated in the middle of the farm and protected by a stockade fence to block the wind.

""Inside that 15-foot-square enclosure there were four bee hives. Somebody had to know they were there,"" Garnham said. ""It must be a pretty twisted mind.""

What makes the incident even more puzzling, he said, is that the bees would have died in the spring.

""In summer, the life span of a bee is about three weeks,"" said Garnham, who as a master gardener has been specially trained to teach about plants, insects both beneficial and harmful, the growing of vegetables and landscaping.

The East End Cooperative Organic Farm, a not-for-profit organization, was created nine years ago and operates the town-owned community farm at 55 Long Lane, opposite the East Hampton High School athletic field.

Dirt roads crisscross the site, where seven small farms and 120 leased community gardens operate each year. The farms range from 1 to 18 acres, and the gardens are each 20 by 20 feet. Five acres on the farm are used for producing compost.",24/12/2010
NewsDay,Akst: Determining the value of a life,"Daniel Akst is a member of the Newsday editorial board.

See if you can imagine anything worse than this: You're moving your car in your own driveway when you back over a little bump.

But that bump turns out to be your infant son, who dies of his injuries. Now all you have to do is live with what you've done for the rest of your life.

I am a father, and so I wish I could say I was making this up. Unfortunately, this is what happened to a man right here on Long Island.

All of us can agree that no one should have to go through such a thing, which is why Congress passed a law in 2007 that will eventually require rearview cameras on new cars. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to impose this for all new cars starting Sept. 1, 2014.

The problem is, this will be expensive. The agency estimates that making cars with the necessary equipment will cost an extra $1.9 billion to $2.7 billion annually - the equivalent of a tax on cars, paid by consumers and car companies. The cameras will save - at best - 112 lives and 8,374 injuries yearly, the agency figures.

Combining all this into a single metric, NHTSA says the law will cost $11.8 million to $19.7 million per ""equivalent life saved"" - way more than the $6.1 million value it normally puts on a life. In other words, the law doesn't pay.

So is it a mistake? Well, the camera technology will probably get cheaper over time, lowering the cost. And I can't put a price on the pain we'll prevent in parents who might have run over their children. But perhaps someone should try, because it's amazing how much good you can do with money.

Scientists have tried to get a handle on this. Based on clever surveys and other techniques, researchers generally accept the value of $50,000 to $100,000 for a good year of life. And many health interventions clock in at way less - making them bargains.

In one study, flu shots for people ages 50 to 64 cost $34,000 per year of life saved. Antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV was around $30,000 for an extra good year.

Some efforts even saved money. In this category, according to a report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is immunization for childhood hepatitis A in parts of the United States where the disease is prevalent. I won't even get into what might be accomplished on behalf of Third World children for an absolute pittance.

It's a wonder we haven't gotten around to such things yet, given the evidence we can save lives at little or no cost. But it's human nature to move mountains to save some recognizable person; we care much less about any statistical ""lives"" whose faces we don't know.

Now, sooner or later in such discussions, we are all tempted to ask, ""How can you put a value on a life?"" But when we ask this, we are really asking two questions.

The harder one is, how do you arrive at a number? The answer is contentious, but government agencies and others do the best they can based on various factors, including how much extra people demand to be paid for doing risky jobs.

The second question is, ""How can you possibly be so callous?"" But putting a number on lives is the very opposite of callous.

Sometimes, for example, we do it because someone must be ""compensated"" for a loss, and while money can never make up for the death of a loved one, it's the best we can do.

More important, we try to put a number on the value of a life because resources are finite, and spending a lot of money to save just a few lives could mean the loss of many more that might have been saved by spending in other ways - however callous the calculation may seem.",24/12/2010
NewsDay,"In Patchogue, filling holiday wishes for hundreds","In the small Patchogue office that houses Thursday’s Child, a group that provides services for people with HIV/AIDS, program manager Greg Noone was looking a little frazzled - albeit smiling.

Sitting in front of his desk, the mother of a 17-year-old held up a pair of children’s jeans.

“These are not going to fit her,” she said. “Maybe one leg.”

Noone apologized for the mistake and presented the woman with a $50 gift card to Walmart. He told her to make sure she got her daughter a new pair of jeans for Christmas.

Just like Santa Claus magically pulling gifts out of a bottomless red bag, Noone has fielded request after request from families that can’t afford to buy gifts for their children all week and never said no. And that’s after he already had a list of 375 children that Thursday’s Child and its partnering organizations were supporting.

“I had seven or eight walk-ins this week,” he said, and in total Thursday’s Child is helping supply presents for more than 400 children across Long Island this Christmas, all of them living with a family member who has HIV/AIDS.

Running the program alongside Thursday’s Child is the Patchogue-based group Blue Angels, founded by Dave Chiarella, Noone said. Blue Angels raises all the money and does all the shopping to get each child on the Thursday’s Child list everything they’ve asked for.

Thursday’s Child works with like organizations around the Island, including Options for Community Living, Economic Opportunity Council of Suffolk, Long Island Association for AIDS Care and Concern for Independent Living, to compile a list of families in need and each child gets to send in his or her own wish list.

On Thursday, Noone said the storage room at the United Methodist Church was looking relatively organized, as bags piled on top of bags filled the room. Each bag had a number attached to it, each number represented a family, to protect their privacy.

There were dolls, clothes, electronic toys and gift cards. Noone said the Blue Angels go above and beyond, purchasing hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise for each family.

“It’s an extraordinary amount of generosity,” he said.

All that was left was the delivery, Noone said, as he walked out the door of his office Thursday evening, his car full of presents, which - like another busy gift-giver - they would be finishing well through Christmas Eve.",23/12/2010
NewsDay,Hot97 DJ suspended after comments about the Haitian community,"Hot97 DJ Cipha Sounds was suspended from the radio station yesterday after an uproar about very insensitive comments the disk jockey made about the Haitian community last week. During the stations morning show, Cipha said, “The reason I’m H.I.V. negative is because I don’t mess with Haitian girls.” Yes, and somehow he though this was funny (ridiculously puzzled face!!).

The station released a statement saying that they would take three measures in order to correct the trauma that these words caused. First, the station announced that DJ Cipha Sounds has been suspended indefinitely. Second, Cipha will immediately undertake sensitivity training focused on the Haitian community and specifically, the challenges the Haitian community has faced in terms of the HIV epidemic. Finally, HOT 97 announced it will work with local community leaders to utilize the influence of HOT 97 to increase awareness of HIV and community programs to address the HIV epidemic.

First of all, WHAT WAS CIPHA THINKING?! After everything these people have had to endure with the earthquake that almost destroyed their homeland in January and HIV is NEVER something to joke about, how could he think this was ok? I grew up in the East Flatbush area of Brooklyn where there is a heavy Haitian population and they are some of the nicest, down to earth and funny people I have ever met. Not to mention they are big supporters of Hot97 especially after the way the station repped hard for the community in the aftermath the earthquake with fundraisers and playing Kompa for the first time ever on the stations airwaves.

For as many times as Funk Master Flex played the sound bite on his show, “Cipha don’t get gassed!!,” he def got gassed by thinking he could say something like this and get away with it. Didn’t he learn anything from the hot mess that was Starr and Buck Wild? This may not be as bad as when Starr played a clip of a plane crashing with people screaming over and over again after Aaliyah died, but this comment is up there. There are just some things you don’t say when you are on a radio show that gets broadcasted to millions.

Below is a video of Cipha apologizing for his comments. Do you think that his suspension was justified? Hit us up with your comments and let us know.",22/12/2010
NewsDay,Vatican clarifies pope’s condom comments,"The Vatican on Tuesday sought to clarify the pope’s controversial comments about condoms and HIV, saying he by no means suggested condom use could be condoned as a means of avoiding pregnancy.

The Vatican’s moral watchdog, the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a statement Tuesday saying some commentators had misunderstood and misrepresented the pope’s remarks in a book-length interview released last month entitled “Light of the World.”

The Vatican has been under pressure from conservative theologians to issue such a clarification amid widespread confusion about what Pope Benedict XVI meant and whether he was breaking with church teaching.

In the book, Benedict said that condoms weren’t the real or moral solution to battling HIV and AIDS. But he said that condom use in some cases, such as for male prostitutes, could be a first step toward a more moral and responsible human sexuality.

The Vatican statement reaffirmed that the church considered prostitution “gravely immoral.”

“However, those involved in prostitution who are HIV positive and who seek to diminish the risk of contagion by the use of a condom may be taking the first step in respecting the life of another even if the evil of prostitution remains in all its gravity,” the statement said.

It insisted that Benedict’s statement was “in full conformity with the moral theological tradition of the church.”",21/12/2010
NewsDay,Thrift store reopens in Lake Ronkonkoma,"The bright red ribbon tied to deck posts in front of Options Thrift Store in Lake Ronkonkoma had barely fallen to the ground after being cut when the store's first sale was completed.

The customer, who had joined the large crowd gathered for the store’s grand reopening on Wednesday, had come in before the ribbon-cutting ceremony to keep warm, and took the opportunity to browse through the merchandise a little early.

“You’re the first!” said Linda Longo, community resource coordinator for Options for Community Living, the organization that runs the thrift store and provides services for people with special needs.

“I wanted to get out before it got crazy,” she said.

The thrift store, at the corner of Hawkins Avenue and Division Street in Lake Ronkonkoma, first opened about 20 years ago and was immediately embraced by the community, said Longo, who has worked with the organization since that time. The store not only provides a service to the community and brings revenue back to the program, she said, but is an important and valuable job-training program for the organization’s residents, who live in community or individual housing run by Options.

About three-and-a-half years ago, the building all but burned down in a fire, Longo said, leaving a void in the program.

“They just stayed put,” Longo said of the residents while the store was closed. “I would meet with them and talk to them about the store to keep everyone interested. And now, it’s wonderful. It’s like we were never closed. Every single person is back, the customers, too.”

Diana Arens, a co-founder and executive director of Options, said they started the store with a meager $5,000 grant, and it has grown over the years. She said Options for Community Living was founded in 1982 and services more than 1,000 families or individuals a year, providing community and individual housing, mental health services and contact to medical services for people with HIV/AIDS.

A large part of the organization’s mission, she said, is to help residents succeed in the community. The opportunity for residents to volunteer at the store advances that mission and helps the residents transition into part-time employment elsewhere.

“It’s a place where they can learn retail skills in a supportive environment,” Arens said. “And they gain self-esteem from doing something satisfying.”

Tonya Bond reached out to Options two years ago when she needed housing. Options accepted her into its program and moved her into a house in Farmingville with two other women. She had a temporary job placement, which ended recently, in time for her to accept a volunteer position at the thrift store while she looks for something permanent.

She said she’s excited to give back to the program and to help others.

“I’m at my best right now,” she said. “I’m optimistic for the future.”

NewsDay,"State honors 2 LI teens for HIV, AIDS education work","Alba Bonilla was in the ninth grade when a table at a local health fair caught her attention. She learned that her home community of Hempstead had one of the highest rates of AIDS-HIV infections in Nassau County and volunteers were needed to educate others about prevention.

""I was shocked,"" said Bonilla, now 15 and in the 10th grade at Hempstead High School. ""And they were telling us if we wanted to join, to help the community and I was like 'I am down for that.' I wanted to help my community.""

Bonilla and Jana Jackson, 17, of Amityville, were among those honored Tuesday in Albany by state Health Commissioner Richard F. Daines for their contributions to HIV and AIDS education. The ceremony at Plaza Convention Center Tuesday marked the observance of World AIDS Day Wednesday. More than 125,000 individuals are living with HIV or AIDS in New York State.

Bonilla volunteers as a youth peer educator for Leadership Training Institute's HIV-AIDS prevention program called Communities of Color, based in Hempstead. Bonilla, who also speaks Spanish, visits local churches and community groups to raise awareness.

""She heard about what we are doing and she said, 'I am willing to give it a shot,' and she is really good at what she does,"" said Preeti Sulibhavi, program manager for Communities of Color.

Bonilla said she believes she connects with her fellow students.

NewsDay,Celebrities to sign off social media platforms for charity,"Alicia Keys and Lady Gaga take charity work seriously, and they're going offline to prove it.

Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Usher and other celebrities have joined a new campaign called Digital Life Sacrifice on behalf of Keys' charity, Keep a Child Alive. The entertainers plan to sign off of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday, which is World AIDS Day. The participants will sign back on when the charity raises $1 million, The Associated Press reports.

""It's really important and supercool to use mediums that we naturally are on,"" Keys said last week.

For the campaign - which also includes Jennifer Hudson, Ryan Seacrest, KimKardashian, Elijah Wood, Serena Williams and Keys' husband, Swizz Beatz - celebrities have filmed ""last tweet and testament"" videos and will appear in ads showing them lying in coffins to represent what the campaign calls their digital deaths.

""It's so important to shock you to the point of waking up,"" Keys said. ""It's not that people don't care or it's not that people don't want to do something, it's that they never thought of it quite like that."" The campaign puts the disease in perspective, said Keys, who has more than 2.6 million followers on Twitter.

NewsDay,Diocese seeks to clarify pope's statement on condoms,"Responding to what it characterized as confusion over the pope's comments on condoms, the Diocese of Rockville Centre has posted an article on its website and in its newspaper to try to dispel what a spokesman called media misreporting about Benedict XVI's statements.

In his comments to a German journalist, Benedict said condoms were not ""a real or moral solution,"" but that in some cases their use could be seen as ""a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility."" Many people took those comments and others from the Vatican as an endorsement of using condoms to help prevent the spread of AIDS.

In response Wednesday, the diocese said the pope's statements do not change official church policy against birth control, and that Benedict is not endorsing the use of condoms even in specific situations such as an HIV-infected male prostitute - an example the pope alluded to.

""We've been hearing the commotion,"" said diocesan spokesman Sean Dolan. Catholic faithful and even priests want to know ""is there any truth to this? What is the truth? What's happening?""

Dolan said the diocese decided to post on its website the article by John M. Hass, a theologian who is president of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, to try to answer the questions.

Haas wrote that ""a careful reading of the text could not possibly lead one to conclude that the Pope has approved condom use . . . The interview with Pope Benedict indicates no change in Church teaching but is a renewed call for chastity and abstinence as the most effective means of fighting the spread of AIDS.""

He also wrote that the pope ""expresses hope for the conversion of a sinner by suggesting that the use of a condom MIGHT be an expression of his concern for the 'other.' ""

Dolan also said Benedict was not encouraging HIV-infected male prostitutes - or anyone else - to use condoms. He said such use would merely indicate that ""maybe this person is moving in the right direction morally"" by being concerned for the welfare of another.

Many Church theologians and thinkers contend the pope's comments do represent a clear shift in policies. ""In the past, the Vatican has been so critical of condoms that it has led some Catholics to think that condoms are somehow intrinsically evil - that there is no conceivable situation where they could be used morally,"" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center in Washington, D.C. ""The pope's new statement blasts that idea out of the water.""

In an interview, Dolan said major media outlets ""misreported"" the pope's statements. ""The news media outlets went for sensationalism first,"" he said, ""and they kind of forgot about accuracy.""",24/11/2010
NewsDay,Bicycle group donates to Patchogue AIDS charity,"Thursday’s Child of Long Island, a Patchogue-based organization that provides services for Long Islanders with HIV/AIDS, received a $1,500 donation Wednesday from the charity bicycle group Ride to Heal.

Tom Monks and Raul Cotilla, co-founders of Ride to Heal, started the organization in 2008 in memory of Monks’ brother, Jim, who died of AIDS in 1991. The group organizes long- and short-distance rides along the East Coast throughout the year.

“We just wish we could give more,” Monks said Wednesday at Thursday’s Child headquarters.

Gregory Noone, program manager for Thursday’s Child, said donations are crucial for the organization, which has helped families and individuals maintain and manage their care since 1989.

Noone said Thursday’s Child lost millions of dollars in federal funding three years ago and survives on the charity of organizations like Ride to Heal.

“It’s the only way we've survived,” he said. “Because of people like Raul and Tom.”

Noone said the donation will help Thursday’s Child provide food, transportation and housing for its clients.

NewsDay,Vatican: Condom use less evil than spreading HIV,"In a seismic shift on one of the most profound — and profoundly contentious — Roman Catholic teachings, the Vatican said Tuesday that condoms are the lesser of two evils when used to curb the spread of AIDS, even if their use prevents a pregnancy.

The position was an acknowledgment that the church’s long-held anti-birth control stance against condoms doesn’t justify putting lives at risk.

“This is a game-changer,” declared the Rev. James Martin, a prominent Jesuit writer and editor.

The new stance was staked out as the Vatican explained Pope Benedict XVI’s comments on condoms and HIV in a book that came out Tuesday based on his interview with a German journalist.

The Vatican still holds that condom use is immoral and that church doctrine forbidding artificial birth control remains unchanged. Still, the reassessment on condom use to help prevent disease carries profound significance, particularly in Africa where AIDS is rampant.

“By acknowledging that condoms help prevent the spread of HIV between people in sexual relationships, the pope has completely changed the Catholic discussion on condoms,” said Martin, a liberal-leaning author of several books about spirituality and Catholic teaching.

The development came on a day when U.N. AIDS officials announced that the number of new HIV cases has fallen significantly — thanks to condom use — and a U.S. medical journal published a study showing that a daily pill could help prevent spread of the virus among gay men.

“This is a great day in the fight against AIDS ... a major milestone,” said Mitchell Warren, head of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition.

Theologians have debated for years whether it could be morally acceptable for HIV-infected people to use condoms to avoid infecting their partners. The Vatican years ago was reportedly preparing a document on the subject, but it never came out.

The groundbreaking shift, coming as it does from the deeply conservative pontiff, would appear likely to restrain any public criticism from Catholic conservatives, who insisted Tuesday that the pope was merely reaffirming the church’s moral teaching.

Conservatives have feared that a comment like this would give support to Catholics who want to challenge the church’s ban on artificial contraception in an environment where they feel they are under siege from a secular, anti-Catholic culture.

George Weigel, a conservative Catholic writer, said the Vatican was by no means endorsing condom use as a method of contraception or a means of AIDS prevention.

“This is admittedly a difficult distinction to grasp,” he told The Associated Press in an e-mail. What the pontiff is saying is “that someone determined to do something wrong may be showing a glimmer of moral common sense by not doing that wrong thing in the worst possible way — which is not an endorsement of anything.”

Benedict’s comments come at a time when bishops in the United States are intensely focused on upholding the strictest views of Catholic orthodoxy, emphasizing traditional marriage, natural family planning based on a woman’s menstrual cycle and making abortion the most important issue.

In the book, “Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times,” Benedict was quoted as saying that condom use by people such as male prostitutes indicated they were moving toward a more moral and responsible sexuality by aiming to protect their partner from a deadly infection.

His comments implied that he was referring primarily to homosexual sex, when condoms aren’t being used as a form of contraception.

However, questions arose immediately about the pope’s intent because the Italian translation of the book used the feminine for prostitute, whereas the original German used the masculine.

The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, told reporters Tuesday that he asked the pope whether he intended his comments to apply only to men. Benedict replied that it really didn’t matter, the important thing was that the person took into consideration the life of another.

“I personally asked the pope if there was a serious, important problem in the choice of the masculine over the feminine,” Lombardi said. “He told me no. The problem is this: ... It’s the first step of taking responsibility, of taking into consideration the risk of the life of another with whom you have a relationship.”

“This is if you’re a man, a woman, or a transsexual. ... The point is it’s a first step of taking responsibility, of avoiding passing a grave risk onto another,” Lombardi said.

Those comments concluded the press conference, and Lombardi took no further questions about how broadly this interpretation could be applied.

The clarification is significant. UNAIDS estimates that 22.4 million people in Africa are infected with HIV, and that 54 percent — or 12.1 million — are women. Heterosexual transmission of HIV and multiple, heterosexual partners are believed to be the major cause of the high infection rates.

Benedict drew harsh criticism when, en route to Africa in 2009, he told reporters that the AIDS problem couldn’t be resolved by distributing condoms. “On the contrary, it increases the problem,” he said then.

In Africa on Tuesday, AIDS activists, clerics and ordinary Africans applauded the pope’s revised comments.

“I say, hurrah for Pope Benedict,” exclaimed Linda-Gail Bekker, chief executive of South Africa’s Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation. She said the pope’s statement may prompt many people to “adopt a simple lifestyle strategy to protect themselves.”

In Sierra Leone, the director of the National AIDS Secretariat predicted condom use would now increase, lowering the number of new infections.

“Once the pope has made a pronouncement, his priests will be in the forefront in advocating for their perceived use of condoms,” said the official, Dr. Brima Kargbo.

Lombardi said Benedict knew full well that his comments would provoke intense debate. Conservative Catholics have been trying to minimize what he said since excerpts were published this weekend in the Vatican newspaper.

The Rev. Tim Finnegan, a conservative British blogger, said he thought the pope’s comments were unwise. “I’m sorry. I love the Holy Father very much; he is a deeply holy man and has done a great deal for the church,” Finnegan said on his blog. “On this particular issue, I disagree with him.”

Lombardi praised Benedict for his “courage” in confronting the problem.

“He did it because he believed that it was a serious, important question in the world of today,” Lombardi said, adding that the pope wanted to give his perspective on the need for greater humanized, responsible sexuality.

Luigi Accatoli, a veteran Vatican journalist who was on the Vatican panel that launched the book, put it this way:

“He spoke with caution and courage of a pragmatic way through which missionaries and other ecclesial workers can help to defeat the pandemic of AIDS without approving, but also without excluding — in particular cases — the use of a condom,” Accatoli said.

The launch of the book, which includes wide-ranging comments on subjects from the sex abuse crisis to Benedict’s belief that popes should resign if physically unable to carry out their mission, drew a packed audience. Making a rare appearance, Benedict’s secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, sat in the front row — an indication of the event’s significance.

In the book, the pope reaffirms Vatican opposition to homosexual acts and artificial contraception, as well as the inviolability of marriage between man and woman.

But by broadening the condom comments to also apply to women, the pope was saying that condom use is a lesser evil than passing HIV onto a partner, even when pregnancy is possible.

“We’re not just talking about an encounter between two men, which has little to do with procreation. We’re now introducing relationships that could lead to childbirth,” Martin said.

Individual bishops and theologians have applied the lesser evil theory to the condom-HIV issue, but it had previously been rejected at the highest levels of the Vatican, Martin said.

Monsignor Jacques Suaudeau, an expert on the Vatican’s bioethics advisory board, said the pope was articulating the theological idea that there are degrees of evil.

“Contraception is not the worst evil. The church does not see it as good, but the church does not see it as the worst,” he told the AP. “Abortion is far worse. Passing on HIV is criminal. That is absolute irresponsibility.”

He said the pope broached the topic because questions about condoms and AIDS persisted, and the church’s teaching hadn’t been clear. There is no official Vatican policy about condoms and HIV, and Vatican officials in the past have insisted that condoms not only don’t help fight HIV transmission but make it worse because it gives users a false sense of security.

“This pope gave this interview. He was not foolish. It was intentional,” Suaudeau said. “He thought that this was a way of bringing up many questions. Why? Because it’s true that the church sometimes has not been too clear.”

Lombardi said the pope didn’t use the technical terminology “lesser evil” in his comments because he wanted his words to be understood by the general public. Vatican officials, however, said that was what he meant.

“The contribution the pope wanted to give is not a technical discussion with scientific language on moral problems,” Lombardi said. “This is not the job of a book of this type.”",23/11/2010
NewsDay,Study: HIV pill protects healthy gay men from virus,"Scientists have an exciting breakthrough in the fight against AIDS. A pill already used to treat HIV infection turns out to be a powerful weapon in protecting healthy gay men from catching the virus, a global study found.

Daily doses of Truvada cut the risk of infection by 44 percent when given with condoms, counseling and other prevention services. Men who took their pills most faithfully had even more protection, up to 73 percent.

Researchers had feared the pills might give a false sense of security and make men less likely to use condoms or to limit their partners, but the opposite happened — risky sex declined.

The results are ""a major advance"" that can help curb the epidemic in gay men, said Dr. Kevin Fenton, AIDS prevention chief at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But he warned they may not apply to people exposed to HIV through male-female sex, drug use or other ways. Studies in those groups are under way

now.

""This is a great day in the fight against AIDS ... a major milestone,"" said a statment from Mitchell Warren, head of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, a nonprofit group that works on HIV prevention.

Because Truvada is already on the market, the CDC is rushing to develop guidelines for doctors using it for HIV prevention, and urged people to wait until those are ready.

""It’s not time for gay and bisexual men to throw out their condoms,"" Fenton said. The pill ""should never be seen as a first line of defense against HIV."" As a practical matter, price could limit use. The pills cost from $5,000 to $14,000 a year in the United States, but only 39 cents a day in some poor countries where they are sold in generic form.

Whether insurers or government health programs should pay for them is one of the tough issues to be sorted out, and cost-effectiveness analyses should help, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""This is an exciting finding,"" but it ""is only one study in one specific study population,” so its impact on others is unknown, Fauci said.

His institute sponsored the study with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Results were reported at a news conference Tuesday and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.

It is the third AIDS prevention victory in about a year. In September 2009, scientists announced that a vaccine they are now trying to improve had protected one in 3 people from getting HIV in a study in Thailand. In July, research in South Africa showed that a vaginal gel spiked with an AIDS drug could cut nearly in half a woman’s chances of getting HIV from an infected partner.

Gay and bisexual men account for nearly half of the more than 1 million Americans living with HIV. Worldwide, more than 40 million people have the virus, and 7,500 new infections occur each day. Unlike in the U.S., only 5 to 10 percent of global cases involve sex between men.

""The condom is still the first line of defense,” because it also prevents other sexually spread diseases and unwanted pregnancies, said the study leader, Dr. Robert M. Grant of the Gladstone Institutes, a private foundation affliated with the University of California, San Francisco.

But many men don’t or won’t use condoms all the time, so researchers have been testing other prevention tools.

AIDS drugs already are used to prevent infection in health care workers accidentally exposed to HIV, and in babies whose pregnant mothers are on the medication. Taking these drugs before exposure to the virus may keep it from taking hold, just as taking malaria pills in advance can prevent that disease when someone is bitten by an

infected mosquito.

The strategy showed great promise in monkey studies using tenofovir (brand name Viread) and emtricitabine, or FTC (Emtriva), sold in combination as Truvada by California-based Gilead Sciences Inc.

The company donated Truvada for the study, which involved about 2,500 men at high risk of HIV infection in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand and the United States (San Francisco and Boston). The foreign sites were chosen because of high rates of HIV infection and diverse populations.

More than 40 percent of participants had taken money for sex at least once. At the start of the study, they had 18 partners on average; that dropped to around 6 by the end.

The men were given either Truvada or dummy pills. All had monthly visits to get HIV testing, more pills and counseling. Every six months, they were tested for other sexually spread diseases and treated as needed.

After a median followup of just over a year, there were 64 HIV infections among the 1,248 men on dummy pills, and only 36 among the 1,251 on Truvada.

Among men who took their pills at least half the time, determined through interviews and pill counts, the risk of infection fell by 50 percent. For those who took pills on 90 percent or more days, risk fell 73 percent. Tests of drug levels in the blood confirmed that more consistent pill-taking gave better protection.

The treatment was safe. Side effects were similar in both groups except for nausea, which was more common in the drug group for the first month but not after that. Unintended weight loss also was more common in the drug group, but it occurred in very few. Further study is needed on possible long-term risks.

What’s next?

All participants will get a chance to take Truvada in an 18-month extension of the study. Researchers want to see whether men will take the pill more faithfully if they know it helps, and whether that provides better protection. About 20,000 people are enrolled in other studies testing Truvada or its component drugs around the world.

The government also will review all ongoing prevention studies, such as those of vaccines or anti-AIDS gels, and consider whether any people currently assigned to get dummy medicines should now get Truvada since it has proved effective in gay men.

Gilead also will discuss with public health and regulatory agencies the possibility and wisdom of seeking approval to market Truvada for prevention. The company has made no decision on that, said Dr. Howard Jaffe, president of Gilead Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm. Doctors can prescribe it for this purpose now if patients are willing to pay for it, and some already do.

Some people have speculated that could expose Gilead to new liability concerns, if someone took the pill and then sued if it did not protect against infection.

""The potential for having an intervention like this that has never been broadly available before raises new questions.

It is something we would have to discuss internally and externally,"" Jaffe said.

Until the CDC’s detailed advice is available, the agency said gay and bisexual men should:

Use condoms consistently and correctly.

Get tested to know their HIV status and that of their partners, and get tested and treated for syphilis, gonorrhea and other infections that raise the risk of HIV.

Get counseling to reduce drug use and risky sex.

Reduce their number of sexual partners.",23/11/2010

NewsDay,Pope: Condoms OK to stop spread of HIV,"VATICAN CITY - Pope Benedict XVI says in a new book that condoms can be justified for male prostitutes seeking to stop the spread of HIV, a stunning comment for a church criticized for its opposition to condoms and for a pontiff who has blamed them for making the AIDS crisis worse.

The pope made the comments in a book-length interview with a German journalist, ""Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times,"" which is being released Tuesday. The Vatican newspaper ran excerpts yesterday.

Church teaching has long opposed condoms because they are a form of artificial contraception, although it has never released an explicit policy about condoms and HIV. The Vatican has been harshly criticized for its opposition.

Benedict said that condoms are not a moral solution. But he said in some cases, such as for male prostitutes, they could be justified ""in the intention of reducing the risk of infection.""

Benedict called it ""a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way of living sexuality."" He used as an example male prostitutes, for whom contraception is not an issue, as opposed to married couples where one spouse is infected. The Vatican has come under pressure from even some church officials in Africa to condone condom use for monogamous married couples to protect the uninfected spouse from getting infected.

Benedict drew the wrath of the United Nations, European governments and AIDS activists when he told reporters en route to Africa in 2009 that the AIDS problem on the continent couldn't be resolved by distributing condoms.

""On the contrary, it increases the problem,"" he said then.

Journalist Peter Seewald, who interviewed Benedict over the course of six days this summer, raised the Africa condom comments and asked Benedict if it wasn't ""madness"" for the Vatican to forbid a high-risk population to use condoms.

""There may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility,"" Benedict said.

But he stressed that it wasn't the way to deal with the evil of HIV, and elsewhere in the book reaffirmed church teaching on contraception and abortion, saying: ""How many children are killed who might one day have been geniuses, who could have given humanity something new, who could have given us a new Mozart or some new technical discovery?""

He reiterated the church's position that abstinence and marital fidelity is the only sure way to prevent HIV.

Cardinal Elio Sgreccia, the Vatican's longtime top official on bioethics and sexuality, elaborated on the pontiff's comments, stressing that it was imperative to ""make certain that this is the only way to save a life."" Sgreccia told the Italian news agency ANSA that that is why the pope on the condom issue ""dealt with it in the realm of the exceptional.""

NewsDay,Pope: Some condom use 'first step' of morality,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Benedict XVI has opened the door on the previously taboo subject of condoms as a way to fight HIV, saying male prostitutes who use condoms may be beginning to act responsibly. It’s a stunning comment for a pontiff who has blamed condoms for making the AIDS crisis worse.

The pope made the comments in an interview with a German journalist published as a book entitled “Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times,” which is being released Tuesday. The Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano ran excerpts on Saturday.

Church teaching has long opposed condoms because they are a form of artificial contraception, although the Vatican has never released an explicit policy about condoms and HIV. The Vatican has been harshly criticized for its position.

Benedict said that condoms are not a moral solution to stopping AIDS. But he said in some cases, such as for male prostitutes, their use could represent a first step in assuming moral responsibility “in the intention of reducing the risk of infection.”

Benedict made the comment in response to a general question about Africa, where heterosexual HIV spread is rampant.

He used as a specific example male prostitutes, for whom contraception is not usually an issue, but did not mention married couples where one spouse is infected. The Vatican has come under pressure from even church officials to condone condom use for such monogamous married couples to protect the uninfected spouse from transmission.

Journalist Peter Seewald, who interviewed Benedict over the course of six days this summer, raised the Africa condom comments, asking him if it wasn’t “madness” for the Vatican to forbid a high-risk population from using condoms.

“There may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility,” Benedict said.

Asked if that meant that the church wasn’t opposed in principle to condoms, the pope replied:

The church “of course does not regard it as a real or moral solution, but in this or that case, there can be nonetheless in the intention of reducing the risk of infection, a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way, of living sexuality,” according to an English translation of the book obtained by The Associated Press.

Elsewhere in the book he reaffirmed church teaching opposing artificial contraception.

“How many children are killed who might one day have been geniuses, who could have given humanity something new, who could have given us a new Mozart or some new technical discovery?” he asked rhetorically.

He reiterated the church’s position that abstinence and marital fidelity is the only sure way to prevent HIV.

The English publisher of the book, Rev. Joseph Fessio, said the pope was not justifying condom use as a lesser of two evils.

“This is not a justification,” he said. Rather, “The intention of protecting the other from disease, of using a condom, may be a sign of an awakening moral responsibility.”

However, the Rev. Jim Martin, a Catholic writer, said the comments were certainly a departure, an exception where there had never been an exception before.

“While some bishops and archbishops have spoken in this way, the pope has never affirmed this,” Martin said. “And it’s interesting that he uses as an example someone who is trying to act morally to someone else by not passing on an infection, which was always the stance of those people who favored condoms in cases of HIV and AIDS. So it does mark a departure.”

The English translation of the original German specified “male prostitute.” The Italian translation in L’Osservatore Romano, however, used the feminine “prostitute.” The discrepancy wasn’t immediately clear.

Cardinal Elio Sgreccia, the Vatican’s longtime top official on bioethics and sexuality, elaborated on the pontiff’s comments, stressing that it was imperative to “make certain that this is the only way to save a life.” Sgreccia told the Italian news agency ANSA that that is why the pope on the condom issue “dealt with it

in the realm of the exceptional.”

The condom question was one that “needed an answer for a long time,” Sgreccia said. “If Benedict XVI raised the question of exceptions, this exception must be accepted ... and it must be verified that this is the only way to save life. This must be demonstrated,” Sgreccia said.

In the 1960s, the Vatican itself condoned giving contraceptive pills to nuns at risk of rape by fighters in the Congo to prevent pregnancy, arguing that the contraception was a lesser evil than pregnancy.

Archbishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans said clearly the pope wasn’t encouraging condom use.

“I think the pope has been very strong in saying condoms do not solve the problem of morality and do not solve the problem of good sex education. But if a person chooses not to follow the teaching of Christ in the church, they are at least obliged to prevent another person from contracting a disease that is deadly,” he said.

In Africa, Benedict’s comments drew praise among gays and AIDS activists.

“If he’s talking about condoms, it’s a step in the right direction,” said David Kamau, who heads the nonprofit Kenya Treatment Access Movement. “It’s accepting the reality on the ground ... If the Church has failed to get people to follow its moral values and practice abstinence, they should take the next best step and encourage condom use.”

John Kitte, a gay Ugandan, said the pope was acting as a good parent.

“He minds about all the people living on earth. What he has suggested is very good and I encourage gays to take his advice seriously.”

But an evangelist pastor in the Uganda capital of Kampala, Solomon Male, argued the pope shouldn’t be granting any recognition of or encouragement to gays.

“If the Pope is saying so, then he has not read the Bible,” he said. “Gay acts are bad. It is abominable and should not take place.”

Christian Weisner, of the pro-reform group We Are Church in the pope’s native Germany, said the pope’s comments were “surprising, and if that’s the case one can be happy about the pope’s ability to learn.”

In other comments in the book, Benedict said:

— If a pope is no longer physically, psychologically or spiritually capable of doing his job, then he has the “right, and under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign.”

—He was surprised by the scale of clerical sex abuse, particularly in his native Germany, and acknowledged that the Vatican could have better communicated its response. “One can always wonder whether the pope should not speak more often.”

— On Islam in Europe, he declined to endorse such moves as France’s banning the burqa or Switzerland’s citizen referendum to forbid topping mosques with minarets.

“Christians are tolerant, and in that respect they also allow others to have their self-image,” Benedict replied when asked if Christians should be “glad” about such initiatives. “As for the burqa, I can see no reason for a general ban.”

— On Pope Pius XII, the wartime pontiff accused by some Jewish groups of staying publicly silent on the Holocaust: Some historians have asked the Vatican to put Pius’ sainthood process on hold until the Holy See opens up its archives from his papacy. But Benedict said an internal “inspection” of those unpublished documents failed to support “negative” allegations against Pius.

“It is perfectly clear that as soon as he protested publicly, the Germans would have ceased to respect” Vatican extraterritoriality of convents and monasteries who were sheltering Jews from the Nazi occupiers in Rome. “The thousands who had found a safe haven ... would have been surely deported,” Benedict argued.

In the book, Benedict also offers insights into his private life, saying he enjoys watching TV at home in the evenings with his secretaries and the four women who take care of his apartment, preferring the news and an Italian TV show from decades ago “Don Camillo and Peppone” about a parish priest and his bumbling assistant.

He said he always wears his white cassock, never a sweater, and wears an old Junghans watch that was left to him by his sister when she died. When he prays, he said, he prays to the Lord as well as the saints and considers himself good friends with Sts. Augustine, Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas.

In the book, he comes across as open, charming and funny — and deeply concerned about his church, its people and their future.

He reflects on the legacy of the landmark 1968 encyclical, “Humanae vitae,” where Pope Paul VI laid out the church’s opposition to artificial contraception. Decades later, “the basic lines of ‘Humanae vitae’ are still correct.”

Still, the pope said, sexual ethics today pose a huge question. “It is correct there is much in this area that needs to be pondered and expressed in new ways.”

He championed the church’s advocacy of the so-called “rhythm method,” by which a married couple who don’t want to conceive avoid intercourse on days when the woman is likely to be fertile, saying that is “not just a method but a way of life.”

“And that is something fundamentally different from when I take the pill without binding myself interiorly to another person, so that I can jump into bed with a random acquaintance,” Benedict said.",20/11/2010
NewsDay,"After 20 years, sex in U.S. has shifted","When I raised the idea of writing about sex in this column, my editors encouraged me, but my very private husband balked at the prospect of confronting Carrie Bradshawesque dissections of our bedroom habits in his morning paper. Since I can’t really blame him for that, I agreed that our sex life was off limits for publication.

Happily, other people’s sexual relations are still entirely fair game. And all of a sudden, there’s a whole lot more to discuss: Last month, researchers from Indiana University’s Center for Sexual Health Promotion published what they said was the most comprehensive national study on sex in nearly 20 years.

Their findings appear in a special issue of the peer-reviewed Journal of Sexual Medicine and include commentary from several prominent sexual-health experts. “This data provides a contemporary snapshot . . . of the sexual landscape,” says research scientist and lecturer Debby Herbenick, lead author of the study, which surveyed 5,865 teens and adults from ages 14 to 94.

It is certainly interesting reading.“Because nobody really talks about sex, people are very curious about what their neighbors are doing,” says Herbenick. “Learning more about other people’s sex lives provides some type of context about our own lives: whether people are having the same type of sex, with the same frequency and, of course, whether they’re enjoying it or not. We want to provide some answers, and help start a conversation between parents and teen-agers, friends, partners and a range of people.”

So let’s talk, then: According to the study, vaginal intercourse remains the most common sex act, although respondents reported more than 40 unique combinations of behaviors during their most recent sexual experience.

“What this shows is that our sexual space has become incredibly diversified,” says Michael Reece, director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion and a co-author of the study, who notes that Americans are having more oral sex than ever before and that a significant number of straight men and women are experimenting with anal sex: More than 40 percent of men and women 25 and older in the survey said they had tried it.

“They’re not doing it frequently, but they are trying it, and that’s something we just didn’t see 20 years ago,” he explains.

The research also shows that Mom and Dad - and even Grandma and Grandpa - are probably still, well, doing it. Many adults continue to have active, varied sex lives well into their later years, often with longtime partners but even - gasp! - with dates or “friends with benefits,” just like college kids.

In the 50-plus age category, 21 percent of women and 16 percent of men had sex most recently with a casual partner, while 6 percent and 12 percent respectively had sex with a friend.

“Conventional wisdom says that young people are out there having lots of sex and being promiscuous, while older adults have their act together and aren’t having sex in later stages, but these data show frequent sex behaviors across the life span, for people well into the later ages,” says Reece.

He speculates that the advent of drugs such as Viagra, increased exposure to Internet pornography and media influences such as, yes, “Sex and the City,” have affected sexual attitudes and behavior since the last study of this kind.

Still, just because they’re older doesn’t mean that adults are any wiser.

Indeed, this research, which was funded by the maker of Trojan condoms, shows that people older than 40 have the lowest rates of condom use. Specifically, among singles older than 50 who reported more than one sexual partner in the last year or who had sex outside a relationship, just under than one-third of men and women used such protection during sex with a new acquaintance. In addition, nearly 40 percent of older people had never been tested for HIV.

“These are older generations who were probably married at the time that the AIDS crisis unfolded and who didn’t acknowledge that any of the widespread safer-sex messages were for them, and who now find themselves single at 40, 45 or later, and they are having sex with good old Mrs. Jones, the librarian from down the street, who couldn’t possibly have herpes, but then find themselves infected,” says Robin Sawyer, an associate professor and instructor in human sexuality at the University of Maryland.

We also aren’t always on the same page when it comes to pleasure: About 85 percent of men report that their partner had an orgasm the last time they had sex, while only 64 percent of women said they did.

In addition, 30 percent of women experienced pain during their last sexual encounter, compared with just 5 percent of men. “The take-home message of both of these discrepancies is that for people to have pleasurable, satisfying sex lives, it’s always helpful to communicate, to ask each other how things are going, how things feel, to ask if there are things your partner wants done differently,” says Herbenick.

Not surprisingly, the differences don’t end once the sex is done.

In fact, a recent study on post-coital behaviors published in the Journal of Sex Research suggests that every gender-difference cliche you’ve ever heard is true.

According to this small study of 99 women and 71 men, women are more interested in bonding after sex, through kissing, cuddling and talking about their relationship.

Men, on the other hand, are much less likely to want to make a connection, especially in short-term relationships, and more apt to want to have more sex or “engage in other, extrinsically rewarding activities - to smoke, drink, get a snack, ask for favors, things like that,” says study co-author Susan Hughes, an associate professor of psychology at Albright College in Reading, Pa., who speculates that ancient biological differences related to reproductive strategies may be at play.

So is the post-coital cold shoulder inevitable? Deborah Fox, a certified sex therapist in Washington, says no. “Men and women have a lot of differences, and we need to learn to talk and to really understand each other’s needs and stories and experiences,” whether it’s before, during or after sex, she explains.

So I guess that means that even if, like my husband, you’re not up for talking about your sex life in print or another public forum, it probably couldn’t hurt to discuss these issues more in the privacy of your own home.",17/11/2010

NewsDay,Your shuttle mission: Seeing a live takeoff,"Watching a space shuttle launch in Cape Canaveral is an awesome experience. A mushroom of fire roars out from the launchpad as ignition begins and the rocket rises majestically, slowly at first, then faster and faster. Powerful sound waves released from the rocket pound against your chest, then fade as the vehicle gains speed and ascends higher and higher. Spectators can follow the path of the shuttle as a point of light for some time and see the booster rockets drop off when their fuel is expended (bring binoculars).

You can even see the shuttle rising into the sky after its launch from points much farther away. I once watched a rocket shot from an eastward-facing hotel room in Orlando, about 50 miles away, but it's not the same as seeing it blast off from the pad.

With NASA's fleet of shuttles scheduled to be retired next year, Cape Canaveral is bracing for throngs of spectators - perhaps as many as 1 million - on Feb. 27, when the Endeavor is scheduled to blast off for the final time. Funding for one more launch - the Atlantis shuttle in June - has been authorized by NASA, but is awaiting approval as part of the overall budget bill Congress is considering.

If you'd like to be among the crowd to see it happen, you'd better get a move on.



WHAT TO EXPECT

The Endeavor launch is scheduled for Feb. 27, but this could change as flight time approaches. Its main mission is to take the $2-billion Alpha Magnetic spectrometer, a cosmic ray detector, to the International Space Station.

Hotel rooms tend to be booked up early for NASA shuttle launches (some lodgings offer launch packages), so you'll want to nab a reservation, preferably one with a generous cancellation or rescheduling policy, since missions can be postponed by hours, days or even months.

The best strategy is to build some flexibility into your trip - many launch spectators come to Cape Canaveral a day or two before the launch or stay in the area afterward.

On launch day, expect good viewing spots to be crowded or even inaccessible - ditto for parking. Restaurants will be crowded, and traffic after the launch may cause extensive delays.



WHERE TO WATCH

The best seats

The prime viewing spot is at the Kennedy Space Center's Visitor's Complex at Cape Canaveral. Tickets cost $41 ($31 ages 3-11), which includes access to regular exhibits and special launch activities, such as astronaut appearances. Tickets are nonrefundable and are issued on a reserved, mission-specific basis, which means they're still valid if a launch is delayed. Space for the most recent planned shuttle shot, the Discovery, was sold out weeks ahead of time, and you can't even visit the Space Center on launch day unless you have a launch ticket.

The Space Center also offers reserved tickets to view the launch from other desirable locations - including the NASA Causeway (a standing-room-only site 6 miles from the launchpad) and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (12 miles from the launchpad).

Here's the good news - the center hasn't announced when it will start taking reservations for the Feb. 27 launch. A spokesperson recommends visiting kennedyspacecenter.com to sign up for e-mail alerts when registration opens. You can keep tabs on the status of shuttle launches at nasa.gov or by calling 877-313-2610.

That said, take heart. There are many other places from which to watch the shuttle launch.



OTHER VIEWING SPOTS

TITUSVILLE One of the best is Space View Park on the Indian River. The park broadcasts a live audio feed direct from NASA's control room on launch day. It also has a walk tracing the history of space, plus other space-related features.

Usually, the park advises people to arrive there three to five hours early because of the size of the crowd, but with shuttle launches coming to an end, the crowds are bound to be even bigger. Other viewing spots in Titusville include Marina Park, Parrish Park, Sand Point Park, Manzo Park, Kennedy Point Park and Rotary Riverfront (titusville.com).

COCOA BEACH There's the Cocoa Beach Pier, Jetty Park at Port Canaveral, Alan Shepard Park, Fischer Park and Lori Wilson Park.

ROADSIDE VIEW Motorists also can park at roadside where viewing is possible along U.S. 1 or Route 528, but no stopping is allowed on I-95, according to the Brevard County Sheriff's Department.



WHILE YOU'RE THERE

You can enjoy several recently installed attractions at the Space Center complex.

A new IMAX film, ""Hubble 3D,"" narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio, tells the story of the Hubble Space Telescope. A new exhibit using six projection screens, ""Exploration Space: Explorers Wanted,"" speculates on the future of space exploration. And a new interactive stage show, ""Star Trek Live,"" combines science with entertainment using special effects, audience interaction and real space-age technology.

The U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, meanwhile, has the new ""Science on a Sphere"" exhibit, which uses animated images to take visitors through the solar system.

All are included with regular admission to the center ($41; $31 ages 3-11; valid for two days within a week).

Besides the new features, the Space Center complex has enough attractions to keep one occupied most of two days - among them the Shuttle Launch Experience, the Space Center bus tour, Astronaut Encounter and all exhibits (including space capsules and the large outdoor Rocket Garden displaying real rockets). The Astronaut Hall of Fame displays historic spacecraft, offers simulator rides and showcases a collection of astronauts' personal memorabilia.



WHERE TO STAY

Most hotels in the Cape Canaveral area expect to sell out for the Feb. 27 shuttle launch, so very few are offering packages for that period. Indeed, many oceanfront hotels from which one can watch the launch are already fully booked. Check hotel cancellation policy in the event of launch postponement.

Here is a sampling of hotels with availability as of press time. All packages and prices are quoted based on double occupancy - and may change without notice. Visit spacecoast launches.com for other lodging options and shuttle launch viewing tips.

SPACE: THE NEXT FRONTIER

NASA

Following the last of the Shuttle missions, NASA will rely on Russian space vehicles to take astronauts and supplies to the space station. In the United States, however, SpaceX, a private company, has a multibillion-dollar contract from NASA to develop a vehicle capable of taking crew and cargo to the space station. First test flight of the Falcon 9 rocket booster with its Dragon spacecraft attached is scheduled for Nov. 19.



PRIVATE SPACE LAUNCHES

VIRGIN GALACTIC British tycoon Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic says it will begin taking tourists into suborbital space from a spaceport in the New Mexico desert. Its six-passenger vessel, SpaceShipTwo, made a pair of test ""glide flights"" last month. Seats for 21/2-hour flights will cost $200,000 and could begin next year.

BOEING CO. It's lined up Virginia-based Space Adventures to sell seats on the seven-person spaceship it wants to build to fly to the International Space Station starting in 2015. Space Adventures currently sells seats on trips to the space station aboard the Russian-built Soyuz spaceship. - Jay Clarke with the Associated Press",05/11/2010

NewsDay,"Hip meets history in Alexandria, Va.","Just across the Potomac River from the nation's capital, sleepy Old Town Alexandria has shaken itself awake with an injection of superstar chefs, edgy boutiques and hip hotels. Yet, this riverside town, which claims George Washington and Robert E. Lee as native sons, still oozes historic charm with 40 square blocks of 18th and 19th century brick and clapboard homes and hidden gardens.

This old-meets-new ambience is particularly appealing to visitors who can explore historic sites and roam the lively arts scene at night.

Alexandrians also start getting into the Halloween mood as South Lee Street homeowners festoon their stoops with spider webs and ghoulish creatures. Restaurants along and around King Street still offer outdoor dining.

Old Town's languid pace offers a relaxing contrast to the long lines and buzz of D.C., but the capital is only 20 minutes away, as is George Washington's home, Mount Vernon.

With Alexandria just a half-day's drive or one-hour flight from New York City, it's an attractive long weekend destination for Long Islanders.

The cheeky Eamonn's A Dublin Chipper for crunchy slabs of fried cod with a choice of seven secret sauces, chips with malt vinegar and a fried candy bar to top it off. For the ultimate indulgence, try a Chip Butty, a fall and winter specialty sandwich of French fries, Irish butter and curry sauce (703-299-8384, eamonnsdublinchipper.com).



DINE ON THE EDGE

Make reservations early to dine at the coolly elegant BRABO by Robert Wiedmaier. Seasonal produce drives the Belgian-inspired cuisine with a contemporary twist. Expect to pay a minimum of $60 a person without wine. Or sip a signature cocktail, such as the divine Lavender Breeze ($13) at BRABO's hammered copper bar and then head next door to the less-pricey, but equally chic, BRABO's Tasting Room (703-894-3440, braborestaurant.com).



GOOD FOR DRINKS

Old Town's languid pace offers a relaxing contrast to the long lines and buzz of D.C., but the capital is only 20 minutes away, as is George Washington's home, Mount Vernon.

With Alexandria just a half-day's drive or one-hour flight from New York City, it's an attractive long weekend destination for Long Islanders.

WHAT TO DO

Chase specters

Explore Old Town at night on a lantern-lit walking tour of ghosts and graveyards led by a guide clad in Colonial dress. The flickering gas lamps of Colonial and Victorian houses and cobblestone streets add a romantic touch to the evening stroll. The public one-hour ""Ghosts and Graveyard"" tours continue on Friday and Saturday evenings through Nov. 27 ($10 adults, $5 ages 7-17; 703-519-1749, alexcolonialtours .com).

NewsDay,Huntington celebrates annual Apple Festival,"The Huntington Historical Society continued a long-standing tradition on Sunday with its annual Apple Festival.

About 1,500 people attended the festival at the Dr. Daniel W. Kissam House Museum -- structure that was originally built in 1795 -- and took part in scarecrow making, square dancing and other family activities, said Maria De Leo, office coordinator for the historical society.

Festival workers dressed in colonial garb and showed visitors how to bake bread in the Kissam house’s original outdoor oven - called a bee hive oven - churn butter and work a loom.

De Leo said the historic house was also open for tours during the event.

NewsDay,Porn industry halts after actor tests positive for HIV,"A California porn actor’s HIV-positive test has sent shockwaves through the adult-film industry and shut down at least two of its production companies.

Among them, industry giants Wicked Pictures and Vivid Entertainment yesterday suspended all upcoming projects until the details of the case are clearer.

“We did this as a precaution and will continue to monitor the situation,” Vivid’s co-founder Steven Hirsch said. “We will wait for all of the facts to emerge before we resume production.”

While the performer’s identity has not been released, RadarOnline reported that it is a male who’s acted in both gay and straight videos.

A clinic for the industry announced the results and said it’s contacting actors who worked with the person, reports said.

By law, actors must test negative for HIV within 30 days of filming.

Last year, an actress tested HIV-positive, but no other actors were infected. And in 2004, a male actor unknowingly spread the virus to three actresses. He had tested negative for HIV, but he was in fact positive.

Public health officials have decried the industry’s opposition to use condoms, which porn producers claim is a turn-off for viewers.",13/10/2010
NewsDay,Seven wonders from 'Swan Lake' to 'Andrew Jackson',"Forgive the list, please. But seven big and smaller-but-not-lesser events are percolating around the theater this week, and it would be unfair to let the big Broadway ones burst all the bubbles from the others. So, chronologically, here they are.

A LIFE IN THE THEATRE

If you only know David Mamet from the carnivorous dazzle of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""American Buffalo,"" or (poor you) from such lazy recent letdowns as ""November"" and ""Race,"" the author of this wise and almost sweet little comedy might be hard to guess.

It premiered in Mamet's hometown of Chicago in 1977, just after the playwright, not yet 30, had seemed to barge, fully grown, onto the New York radar screen. The play - basically, backstage conversations between an older actor and a younger one - had the identifiable Mamet patter, plus an idealism about the theater that was brutal, but unexpectedly touching. Patrick Stewart plays the elder in this revival, with T.R. Knight as the hungrier kid, a role created by Joe Mantegna.

Opening on Broadway Tuesday at the Schoenfeld Theatre, 236 W. 45th St., $76.50-$121.50, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com.

MATTHEW BOURNE'S SWAN LAKE

When this played Broadway in 1998, Bourne and his producers practically did backbends trying to convince audiences that his male-oriented, modern-ballet version of ""Swan Lake"" was a musical and not a ballet. All the denials struck me as ridiculous, not to mention insulting to dance - as if whole new arts audiences could be built by promising they won't have to endure art.

Anyway, the splashy British production - with its corps of bare-chested male swans in shag-rug Capri pants - is back as part of City Center's dance series. Instead of women with intricate pointe work and tiny birdlike arm movements, expect men with rippling torsos and arms with broad wingspans. I wasn't a fan of the limited steps or the woman-hating subtext. But many around the world have loved it. It won Tonys for choreography, costumes and direction of a musical, so I guess it was a musical after all.

Opening Wednesday for a four-week run at New York City Center, 55th Street west of Seventh Avenue, $25-$110; 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org.

BLOODY BLOODY ANDREW JACKSON

A big hit at the Public Theater last spring, this unlikely and audacious twist on rock-theater is both intentionally sophomoric and sophisticated, both earnest and irreverent, as goofy as it is educational. But does it belong on Broadway?

I hope so. This is a politically and historically flammable show about Jackson, on his way to becoming our seventh president. He is played by Benjamin Walker as a man who loves the fit of his tight jeans and the readiness of his large gun. The show is written and directed by Alex Timbers, who runs Les Freres Corbusier (the Off-Broadway troupe notorious for its award-winning ""A Very Merry Unauthorized Scientology Christmas"") and who also directs ""The Pee-Wee Herman Show"" on Broadway next month.

The music and lyrics by Michael Friedman both satirize and enjoy the style of emo-rock, which stands for emotional hard-core music, meaning people talk about their feelings a lot. Expect mainstream audiences to talk a lot about their feelings about the show.

Opening on Broadway Wednesday at the Jacobs Theatre, 242 W. 45th St., $51.50-$131.50, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com.

NATIONAL THEATRE LIVE

This is the second season for the program that broadcasts live performances from the ever-adventurous stages of London's National Theatre to movie houses all over. Last year launched with Helen Mirren in ""Phèdre,"" which brought the hot ticket to more than 200,000 people in 22 countries.

Season two begins Thursday with something equally heady, if less starry: ""A Disappearing Number"" (seen briefly here as part of the Lincoln Center Festival), by director Simon McBurney and the innovative Complicite theater. This is a multimedia collage - with two love affairs - that focuses on the 1914 collaboration between a great, untrained Indian mathematician and a brilliant Cambridge don.

The series continues through the spring with five more live productions, including Michael Grandage directing Derek Jacobi in a much-anticipated ""King Lear"" (Feb. 3) and Danny Boyle directing a new adaptation of ""Frankenstein"" (March 17).

Thursday, across America, including Kew Gardens Cinemas in Queens, 2 p.m. (live) and 7 p.m., $20, 718-441-9835; also Cinema Arts Center in Huntington, Oct. 22 at 7:30 p.m., $25; 631-423-7611.

LA BÊTE

For a comedy in rhymed couplets, by a young Oxford-educated American, in the style of 17th century France, ""La Bête"" has had its own high-drama story. In 1991, such judges as Edward Albee and Wendy Wasserstein awarded David Hirson's debut an Oppy Award, which Newsday used to give to first plays in New York. The production cost $2 million, said then to be the most expensive nonmusical in Broadway history, and the star, Ron Silver, bailed after the first preview, leaving the plum role to an understudy barely out of drama school.

I cherished the sly extravaganza about the struggle between style and content, but the thing flopped - big time - before being restaged in London and winning the Olivier. Battered and bedecked with prizes, the thing gets another chance, directed by Matthew Warchus and starring David Hyde Pierce and the unstoppable Mark Rylance as La Bête, ""the beast,"" an obnoxious street performer who won't - perhaps can't - shut up.

Opening on Broadway Thursday at the Music Box Theatre, 239 W. 45th St., $76.50-$126.50, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com.

AS IS

It may be impossible to imagine today, but nobody was writing novels, making movies, shooting TV shows about AIDS in 1985. Nobody. Then suddenly, within weeks of each other, came Larry Kramer's furious docudrama, ""The Normal Heart,"" and William M. Hoffman's heartbreaking relationship drama, ""As Is."" The play, about an HIV-positive man and his ex-lover, transferred from Off-Broadway to Broadway and, remarkably, was nominated for a Tony and a Pulitzer.

Twenty five years later, the Apple Core Theater lets us relive the moment when the theater broke the national silence about the then-mysterious plague. It was years before Hollywood dared.

Opening Thursday, The Studio Theatre at Theatre Row, 410 W. 42nd St., $15, 212-239-6200, telecharge.

THE LANGUAGE ARCHIVE

Five years ago, Julia Cho wrote a daring and haunting teen mystery, ""BFE,"" that made me add her name to the list of young playwrights who make me hopeful about the future of serious theater. Less than two years later, the Korean-American writer confirmed her original voice with ""Durango,"" a less surprising but still emotionally complex work about an Asian-American family whose American dream gets stuck in the dusty Durango Mountains.

Now she is back with a comedy involving a linguist who understands far-flung languages but doesn't know how to talk to his wife. I wouldn't want to miss it for most of the big guys on Broadway.

Opening Oct. 17, Laura Pels Theatre, 111 W. 46th St., $71-$81, 212- 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org.",08/10/2010
NewsDay,Roberto Alomar's wife: He has HIV and we had sex unprotected,"The wife of Roberto Alomar says the baseball great had unprotected sex with her despite knowing he’s HIV-positive, the New York Post reported Thursday.

In Florida divorce papers, Maria Del Pilar “Maripily” Rivera Alomar, 33, said he “knew prior to his first sexual contact with [her] that he was HIV-positive,” but lied about to her about it and said STD tests came back negative.

The divorce papers said after Rivera “learned from conclusive proof” that Alomar was HIV-positive, she suffered “extreme emotional distress.” Rivera added that she wouldn’t have married Alomar if she knew he was sick.

She hasn’t tested positive for the virus, but said “uncertainty still exists due to the delay” in its onset.

The 12-time All Star has previously denied having AIDS.

In 2009, his ex-girlfriend Ilya Dall made similar claims. She sued the ex-Met for $15 million, saying he knew he had AIDS but insisted on having unprotected sex.

The case was later settled.

Rivera, who was Alomar’s girlfriend at the time, called Dall’s claim a “vile lie,” reports said.

NewsDay,"New survey on sex in U.S., biggest since '94","The male-female orgasm gap. The sex lives of 14-year-olds. An intriguing breakdown of condom usage rates, by age and ethnicity, with teens emerging as more safe-sex-conscious than boomers.

That’s just a tiny sampling of the data being unveiled Monday in what the researchers say is the largest, most comprehensive national survey of Americans’ sexual behavior since 1994.

Filling 130 pages of a special issue of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, the study offers detailed findings on how often Americans have sex, with whom, and how they respond. In all, 5,865 people, ranging in age from 14 to 94, participated in the survey.

The lead researchers, from Indiana University’s Center for Sexual Health Promotion, said the study fills a void that has grown since the last comparable endeavor — the National Health and Social Life Survey — was published 16 years ago.

Major changes since then include the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, the types of sex education available to young people, the advent of same-sex marriage, and the emergence of the Internet as a tool for social interaction.

Dr. Dennis Fortenberry, a pediatrics professor who was lead author of the study’s section about teen sex, said the overall findings of such a huge survey should provide reassurance to Americans who are curious about how their sex lives compare with others.

“Unless, like al-Qaida, you feel there’s something abnormal about the American people, what these data say is, ’This is normal — everything in there is normal.”’

The researchers said they were struck by the variety of ways in which the subjects engaged in sex — 41 different combinations of sexual acts were tallied, encompassing vaginal and anal intercourse, oral sex, and partnered masturbation.

Men are more likely to experience orgasm when vaginal intercourse is involved, while women are more likely to reach orgasm when they engage in variety of acts, including oral sex, said researcher Debra Herbenick, lead author of the section about women’s sex lives.

She noted there was a gap in perceptions — 85 percent of the men said their latest sexual partner had an orgasm, while only 64 percent of the women reported having an orgasm in their most recent sexual event.

One-third of women experienced genital pain during their most recent sex, compared to 5 percent of men, said Herbenick, citing this as an area warranting further study.

The study, which began taking shape in 2007, was funded by Church & Dwight Co., the manufacturer of Trojan condoms. Questions about condom usage figured prominently in the study, but the researchers — during a teleconference — insisted the integrity of their findings was not affected by the corporate tie.

Among the findings was a high rate of condom usage among 14- to 17-year-olds. Of the surveyed boys who had sexual intercourse, 79 percent reported using a condom on the most recent occasion, compared to 25 percent for all the men in the survey.

However, the sample for that particular question involved only 57 teens in the 14-to-17 age range. That’s far smaller than the thousands involved in latest federal Youth Risk Behavior Survey last year which calculated condom use among sexually active high school students at 61 percent Fortenberry nonetheless found the new findings encouraging.

“There’s been a major shift among young people in the role condoms have in their sexual lives,” he said. “Condoms have become normative.”

Another intriguing finding — rates of condom usage among black and Hispanic men were significantly higher than for whites. The researchers said this suggested that HIV-AIDS awareness programs were now making headway in those communities, which have relatively high rates of the disease.

The lowest condom usage rates were for men over 50 — and the researchers said this was worrisome, raising the risk for disease since an increasing number of older adults had multiple sexual partners.

Other notable findings: —While about 7 percent of adult women and 8 percent of men identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, the proportion of individuals who have had same-gender sex at some point in their lives is higher. For example, 15 percent of the men aged 50-59 said they had received oral sex from another man at some point.

—Among adolescent boys, only about 2 percent of the 14-year-olds — but 40 percent of the 17-year-olds — said they had engaged in sexual intercourse in the past year.

The survey was conducted from March through May of 2009, with the assistance of Knowledge Networks, among a nationally representative sample of adolescents and adults. Once people were selected to participate, they were interviewed online; participants without Internet access were provided it for free.

The researchers said the 1994 survey was compiled through in-person interviews, while the new method — collecting data over the Internet — may help make respondents more comfortable about discussing sexual behaviors.

Dr. Irwin Goldstein, editor-in-chief of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, noted that the new study came more than 60 years after Alfred Kinsey — also based at Indiana University — published his groundbreaking report, “Sexual Behavior in the Human Male.” “Just like then, these papers contain material that is avant garde and often considered off-limits,” Goldstein wrote in a forward to the study.

“At a time when we can have nudity on HBO but cannot use the names of our genitals on the evening news, there remains a need to continue research on sexual health.”

NewsDay,Learn the tricks of these old-fashioned trades,"Fascinated by how things were done ""back then""? From blacksmithing to broom-making, some classic trades are still in practice. Visitors can not only watch demonstrations of these traditional crafts, but can - in some cases - get their hands involved in making something the old-fashioned way.

BEEHIVE OVEN COOKING

WHAT IT IS Using a hive-shaped outdoor brick oven to fire-bake food. Sound straightforward? Not quite - the heating process alone takes about four hours of work, says Toby Kissam, who mans the Huntington Historical Society's oven. ""If you take the fire out too soon and the oven isn't hot enough, you have to start all over,"" he says.

SEE IT Kissam will demonstrate at the historical society's Apple Festival, noon-4 p.m. Oct. 17 at the Daniel W. Kissam House Museum in Huntington (631-427-7045, huntingtonhistoricalsociety.org).

BLACKSMITHING

WHAT IT IS Surprise - the trade involves much more than creating shoes for horses. Blacksmiths use heat as high as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit to bend or pound metal into usable objects (tools, decorative iron).

SEE IT Blacksmiths demonstrate 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Old Bethpage Village Restoration ($12 adults, $8 ages 5-12; 516-572-8400, lifair.org).

Best Bets Get the scoop on events, nightlife, day trips, family fun and things to do on Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

BROOM-MAKING

WHAT IT IS Weaving stalks of wheat into a handmade broom. Such brooms sold for 25 cents in the mid-1800s - expect to spend $12-$20 today. The good news: It should last about five years, even with daily use.

SEE IT Old Bethpage Village Restoration's resident broommaker Tim Van Wickler (his brother Chris is one of the village blacksmiths) demonstrates the trade noon-4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

MILLING GRAIN

WHAT IT IS In the 1700s, wooden mills processed oat, wheat and corn into flour and other products, using a host of grinders and other tools.

SEE IT The Stony Brook Grist Mill (circa 1751) still welcomes visitors for tours of the three-story landmark, where you can see how things used to be done. Tours last 30-45 minutes and cost $2 ($1younger than 12), available noon-4:30 p.m. weekends (631-751-2244, wmho.org).

SPINNING WOOL

WHAT IT IS Turning a big, fluffy bunch of raw sheep's wool into yarn for knitting and crocheting. ""The process involves feeding the fiber into a large wooden wheel that spins and stretches it,"" says Vincent D'Aguanno, co-owner of Rumpelstiltskin Yarns in Sayville. It takes him about a month to make 40 skeins of 150 yards, which retail for $40 each.

SEE IT Drop by the store almost any late afternoon and you're likely to see someone at the wheel. Those who want to learn can take a six-session yarn spinning class for $180 (631-750-1790, rumpelstiltskinyarns.com).

NewsDay,UN: More people got access to AIDS treatment in 2009,"WASHINGTON - There's some encouraging news out about the fight against AIDS worldwide. The number of people who got access to treatment for the AIDS virus rose to 5.2 million in 2009, according to a new report from the United Nations.

That's up more than 1.2 million from 2008, the largest increase yet in any single year, and means that 36 percent of those who need the drugs are getting them, the report said.

The report, from the World Health Organization; United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF; and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, or UNAIDS, assessed progress in delivering lifesaving drugs in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The report found:

15 countries, including Botswana, Guyana and South Africa, were able to provide more than 80 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women the services and drugs needed to prevent them from passing the virus to their babies.

14 countries, including Brazil, Namibia and Ukraine, provided treatment to more than 80 percent of HIV-positive children.

Eight countries, including Cambodia, Cuba and Rwanda, achieved universal access to antiviral treatment for adults.

In eastern and southern Africa, the region most severely affected by HIV, treatment coverage increased from 32 percent to 41 percent in one year, and half of pregnant women were able to get HIV testing and counseling.

In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 1 million more people started antiviral treatment increasing the number getting drugs from 2.95 million to 3.91 million. That meant 37 percent of those who needed the drugs were getting them. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 50 percent of those who needed the drugs were getting them. In East, South and Southeast Asia, the number was 31 percent. In Europe and Central Asia it was 19 percent. And in North Africa and the Middle East, it was 11 percent.

""Countries in all parts of the world are demonstrating that universal access is achievable,"" said Hiroki Nakatani, the WHO's assistant director-general for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases.

Despite the progress, officials said the efforts still have a long way to go and face big problems, most notably getting enough money. At the moment, the program is $10 billion short.",28/09/2010
NewsDay,OPINION: O'Donnell was a Gen Xer before she became a tea partier,"Meghan Daum is author of the forthcoming ""Life Would Be Perfect If I Lived in That House"" and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.

It's true that Christine O'Donnell, Delaware's GOP senatorial candidate, bears some resemblance to Sarah Palin. Both are attractive brunettes who've staked their political careers on extreme social conservatism. Both emerged on the national stage seemingly out of nowhere and proceeded to make liberals and even a lot of Republicans slap their collective foreheads in disbelief. And both are catnip for media that love to search for skeletons in closets that also happen to contain several pairs of designer pumps.

We don't yet have enough information to know whether the abstinence-only, anti-gay, anti-porn, anti-masturbation platform on which she's built her reputation has worked out as well for her in practice as in preachability. But O'Donnell is no Palin clone. For one thing, we know for sure that O'Donnell, who was born in 1969, is a bona fide member of Generation X. Even if she continues to come across like a wacky, sanctimonious wingnut, it could be in a distinctly Gen X way. And that may be one more way we'll begin to see that the tea party isn't as monolithic as it appears.

Palin is just five years older than O'Donnell, but those five years make a big difference. If anything, Palin's air of self-congratulation and loyalty to the edict of ""having it all"" epitomize stereotypical boomerdom. O'Donnell, on the other hand, who's childless, never married and was highly focused on professional goals right out of the gate, betrays a somehow more sober sensibility.

She's also on the leading edge of the generational shift in dirt digging. O'Donnell is too old to have left a self-made trail of cringe-worthy bread crumbs on the social networks, but her career as an advocate for conservative issues was largely dependent on becoming a provocative media personality. She filled the role on shows like ""Politically Incorrect"" and MTV's ""Sex in the '90s.""

Clips from these broadcasts are now all over the place. But despite the media's insistence that it's a real issue, her brush with witchcraft, to take one example, amounts to little more than a bad talk-show anecdote. Another trope has been her distrust of condoms. On ""Politically Incorrect,"" she suggested they didn't do much in the way of preventing pregnancy. There's also a quote from a 2002 interview with Phil Donahue in which she asserted ""condoms will not protect you from AIDS.""

On the one hand, it's hard to believe that any Gen Xer would think such a thing. If you were in your teens or 20s in the late 1980s and early 1990s, you had condoms shoved in your face as vigorously as the fear of HIV transmission was drilled into your brain. On the other hand, in those pre-AIDS cocktail days, the standard message was that there was no such thing as totally safe sex, protected or not. The free-for-all that baby boomers had enjoyed was over; the sex-positive, ""Girls Gone Wild"" sensibility of the millennials was years away. People were still getting it on, of course. But somehow it didn't quite feel like a ""getting it on"" kind of culture.

Amid that gloom and apprehension, O'Donnell carved out the belief system that is now perplexing so much of the nation. Halfway through college, she's told reporters, she quit drinking and having sex, left the Catholic Church for evangelical Christianity, and became a vocal opponent of pornography, homosexuality and, for good measure, masturbation.

Most Gen Xers, of course, have recovered just fine from the sexual disquiet of the peak years of the AIDS crisis. O'Donnell, obviously, is an outlier who could well have developed these views no matter what year she was born. But before we chalk her up as a Palin redux, or as interchangeable with other members of the tea party, we'd do well to consider the ways in which her membership in another relatively small, occasionally misunderstood cohort might make her more interesting than the cartoon-character ""right-wing babe"" that many are now assuming her to be.",26/09/2010
NewsDay,Anemia drugs recalled for glass-flake contamination,"TRENTON, N.J. - Amgen Inc. is recalling some lots of its blockbuster Epogen and Procrit anemia treatments because the injected drugs may contain glass flakes that could cause blood clots, swelling of veins, immune system reactions and other problems.

The Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology company says the flakes are barely visible in most cases, and they have fielded no complaints or reports about problems that can be directly tied to them. Patients experiencing problems should contact their doctor.

Amgen says the flakes are caused by the interaction of the drug with glass vials over the product's shelf life.

The affected lot numbers and expiration dates can be found on websites for the products, and patients can call 1-800-77-AMGEN to ask questions. Patients harmed by the recalled products, or their doctors, should notify the Food and Drug Administration and either Amgen or Johnson & Johnson's Centocor subsidiary.

This is not the first recall this year over a liquid medicine containing glass particles.

Baxter International announced a recall on May 17 for its genetically engineered Hylenex, a solution for rehydrating sick children. Baxter officials also said bits of glass had peeled off the inside of vials.

Epogen treats anemia in patients with chronic renal failure who are on dialysis. Procrit also treats it for cancer patients on chemotherapy and some HIV-infected patients.

Amgen makes both products at plants in Puerto Rico. It has long had a deal under which Johnson & Johnson sells Procrit in the U.S.

The drugs work by stimulating production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, which reduces anemia and can decrease the need for blood transfusions.

Sales of the products have declined somewhat in recent years because of restrictions by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over concerns that higher doses of the drugs can be dangerous. Research has shown the medicines are linked to increased risk of death, heart attack, stroke, life-threatening blood clots and growth of tumors in cancer patients.

Amgen reported $2.6 billion in 2009 sales for Epogen, its No. 2 best-selling drug. Johnson & Johnson posted 2009 sales of $2.2 billion worldwide for Procrit and a similar drug it sells overseas called Eprex.

Shares of Amgen rose 46 cents to $56.18 in late morning trading Friday.",24/09/2010
NewsDay,Top Doctors: Are kids' allergies on the rise?,"More children than ever are being diagnosed with food allergies, and scientists have various theories about why.

""The question is, 'Is that just more recognition based on the fact that we are more aware of these things now, or is there something new in the environment?' "" said Dr. Vincent Bonagura, chief of allergy and immunology and associate chairman for academic development in the pediatric department at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park.

Food allergy occurs when a child's immune system treats proteins in certain foods as if they were germs. The body produces antibodies against the threat of attack. The antibodies trigger the release of chemicals in the bloodstream that induce allergic symptoms.

The most common food allergens are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat and soy, according to the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network, a research and advocacy organization in Fairfax, Va.



SYMPTOMS

Allergic reactions may be mild to deadly and can occur within minutes or hours of consuming a food, according to the federal National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Symptoms include itching in the mouth, swelling of the tongue and throat, hives, vomiting and diarrhea.

At its worst, food allergy can cause a whole-body reaction called anaphylaxis, resulting in low blood pressure and breathing difficulties. A child in anaphylactic shock could lose consciousness or die without immediate treatment with epinephrine, an injectable hormone that counteracts the body's allergic response.

RISK FACTORS

Bonagura said that food allergies tend to run in families.

Overall, about 4 percent of children younger than 18 years have a food allergy, versus just 2 percent of adults, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infants and toddlers are particularly at risk. As many as 8 percent of children younger than 3 have food allergies, according to the allergy institute.

Most children outgrow allergies to milk, egg, soy and wheat. But just 20 percent outgrow peanut allergy, and only 10 percent overcome tree nut allergies, the food allergy network reports.



CURRENT THINKING

Food allergies in U.S. children increased 18 percent from 1997 to 2006, according to the Centers for Disease Control. A separate study by New York City researchers found that the rate of peanut allergy in kids tripled from 1997 to 2008.

However, a recent review of scientific literature published in the Journal of the American Medical Association casts doubt on the prevalence of food allergies. The researchers concluded that a lack of uniform criteria for defining and diagnosing food allergy has created the potential for overdiagnosis.

The standard treatment for a food allergy is to avoid the offending food, but in an experimental approach called oral immunotherapy, researchers are giving study participants tiny amounts of an offending food in increasing doses to desensitize them to the allergen.



THE LONG ISLAND SCENE

Protect Allergic Kids, a Holtsville-based education and support group, holds an annual Halloween party and other events for children with food allergies or other allergic diseases. The group also convenes monthly support group meetings at Nokomis Elementary School in Holbrook.

Cristina Stainkamp, the group's president, said the meetings let parents and caregivers share concerns and pick up new information.

NewsDay,China feared undermining Iran sanctions,"Combined news services

Worried that Chinese oil companies could be undermining new U.S. sanctions against Iran, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said he would push the Obama administration to investigate.

To try to get Iran to drop its nuclear work, Congress passed sanctions that were signed into law in July, targeting financial services and Iran's energy sector, hitting its ability to import gasoline and secure foreign investment.

Rep. Howard Berman (D-Calif.) told the Reuters Washington Summit yesterday that he and the top Republican on the foreign affairs committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, will meet administration officials soon over concerns foreign oil companies, some of which have U.S. subsidiaries, are violating the new law.

In addition to the U.S. measures, new sanctions have been imposed on Iran by the United Nations and the European Union this year to try to force Tehran to halt sensitive nuclear work the West suspects is aimed at bomb-making.

Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, primarily to generate electricity.

President Barack Obama said yesterday that Iran having a nuclear weapon would be a ""real problem."" But he said he did not think Israeli or U.S. military action was the ""ideal way"" to solve the crisis.

The White House said Obama would use a speech at the UN this week to tell Iran the ""door is open"" to better relations with the international community, if it can demonstrate the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.

At UN headquarters in Manhattan, meanwhile, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was the first to accept UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's challenge for nations to deliver more resources to combat global poverty, ignorance and misery. He pledged at the opening of the three-day UN Millennium Development Goals summit to boost France's annual $10-billion contribution to the world's poorest people by 20 percent over the next three years.

UN members resolved a decade ago to reduce extreme poverty by half, ensure that every child finishes primary school, halt the HIV/AIDS pandemic and reduce the number of those without access to clean water and basic sanitation, all by 2015.",20/09/2010
NewsDay,Sarkozy pledges more to fight against poverty,"UNITED NATIONS - French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday pledged to boost aid to the world’s poorest by 20 percent over the next three years and issued a plea for other developed nations to join him in meeting U.N. anti-poverty targets by 2015.

With Millennium Development Goals, set by the U.N. 10 years ago, lagging and hard hit by the global recession, Sarkozy implored world leaders not to fall back into “old bad habits” of ignoring the global poverty as the world economy begins climbing out of the severe economic downturn “We have no right to do less than what we have decided to do,” Sarkozy told the assembled leaders. He also said the world body should join in creating a small international tax on financial transactions that would go toward ending poverty and meeting other millennium goals.

Sarkozy said France currently donates 10 billion euros a year.

“The financial crisis is severe in the rich countries, it creates deficits,” he said, “but its consequences are far worse for the poor countries.” U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the summit with a call to the assembled presidents, prime ministers and kings to use their power to meet U.N. goals to help the world’s poorest by 2015.

Ten years after world leaders set the most ambitious goals ever to tackle global poverty, they are gathered again to spur action to meet the deadline — which the U.N. says will be difficult, if not impossible, in some cases.

General Assembly President Joseph Deiss called the session to order, saying: “We must achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We want to achieve them. And we can achieve them.” For centuries, the plight of the world’s poor had been ignored but with the turn of the new millennium, leaders pledged to begin tackling poverty, disease, ignorance and inequality.

Israeli President Shimon Peres said peace and full stomachs were key to erasing poverty.

“We share the burden of saving the world from war and hunger. Without peace, poverty will remain. Without food, peace will not prevail,” he said.

World leaders have vowed to reduce extreme poverty by half, ensure that every child has a primary school education, halt and reverse the HIV/AIDS pandemic, reduce maternal mortality by three-quarters and child mortality by two-thirds. Goals additionally called for cutting by half the number of people without access to clean water and basic sanitation — all by 2015.

They also set goals to promote equality for women, protect the environment, increase development aid, and open the global trading and financial system.

“We brought new urgency to an age-old mission,” the secretary-general told the assembled leaders. “And now, we have real results. New thinking and path-breaking public-private partnerships. Dramatic increases in school enrollment. Expanded access to clean water. Better control of disease. The spread of technology — from mobile to green.” But Ban call the advances “fragile” and declared “the clock is ticking, with much more to do.” He urged the leaders to deliver the needed resources “above all by exercising political leadership.”

“Despite the obstacles, despite the skepticism, despite the fast-approaching deadline of 2015, the Millennium Development Goals are achievable,” the secretary-general said.

More than 140 world leaders were expected at the summit and security was exceedingly tight, as even U.N. staff and permanent correspondents were subjected full screening to enter and move around the international complex.

U.N. missions have often been the target of terrorist attacks worldwide. The international organization’s operation in Baghdad was one of the first hit in a deadly bombing as the insurgency there gained strength in late 2003.

Many heavily armed U.S. Coast Guard and New York police craft patrolled the East River along side the U.N. complex. Frogmen were aboard interceptor boats mounted with .50 caliber machine guns.

The three-day summit on the goals, known as the MDGs, will be followed by the annual ministerial meeting of the General Assembly so leaders will be presenting positions not only on global anti-poverty plans but also on global issues.

In advance of this week’s summit, diplomats from the 192 U.N. member states agreed on the document to be adopted by the leaders which spells out specific actions to accelerate implementation of each of the eight Millennium Development Goals, known as the MDGs, in the next five years.

“We are convinced that the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved, including in the poorest countries, with renewed commitment, effective implementation, and intensified collective action by all member states and other relevant stakeholders at both domestic and international levels,” it says.

Many recent reports show that the world’s poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have made little progress in eradicating poverty. And in Africa, Asia and Latin America there also has been a lack of progress in reducing mother and child deaths, providing clean water and sanitation, and promoting women’s equality.

“Many countries are falling short, especially in Africa,” Ban warned, and “inequities are growing within and among countries,” a problem compounded by the global economic crisis.

Amnesty International, which says world leaders have failed more than a billion of the world’s poorest people, will be unveiling a Maternal Death Clock in Times Square in the heart of New York on Monday to count maternal deaths around the globe while world leaders are meeting.

Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high and the clock will begin at 5,317,280, the number of women Amnesty says have died since the MDGs were adopted in September 2000. It predicted about 3,700 more will die during the summit, which ends Wednesday.

On the plus side, the Overseas Development Institute, a British think tank, said Ghana outperformed all other countries in reducing hunger by nearly three-quarters, from 34 percent in 1990 to 9 percent in 2004. Vietnam reduced the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day from nearly 66 percent to 20 percent in just 14 years. Ten African countries, including Ethiopia, Egypt, and post-conflict Angola, have halved their absolute poverty levels, Benin ranked in the top 10 in education improvements, and Angola and Niger significantly reduced child deaths.

On the minus side, Amnesty International said an estimated 70 percent of those living in poverty are women, but efforts in many countries fail to address the widespread discrimination women face in accessing food, water, sanitation and housing — especially in slums. It accused Kenya of ignoring the needs of women living in slums and Nigeria of evicting slum dwellers and driving them deeper into poverty.

Even if the main goal of reducing extreme poverty by half is achieved, the U.N. said nearly one billion people will still be living on less than $1.25 a day.",20/09/2010
NewsDay,Eataly: An Italian food destination,"I was half dreading Eataly, the enormous Italian food emporium that opened last Tuesday in Manhattan's Flatiron district. A joint venture between the original Eataly in Turin, Italy, and B&B Hospitality (the restaurant group run by Mario Batali and Joe and Lidia Bastianich), it sounded ominously close to a culinary Epcot, a simulacrum of the Italian food-shopping experience.

All my doubts vanished within a few feet of the threshold, where I beheld a range of Italian vegetables rarely seen on these shores: Treviso radicchio and the rarer Castelfranco variety, baby artichokes in both green and red, fresh romano and fava beans, baby fennel with the roots still attached. And presiding over everything, ""vegetable butcher"" Jennifer Rubell, who was calmly trimming artichokes and dropping them into clear bins of water in which bobbed halved lemons.

From the narrow vegetable department, the store widens out into a vast warren of distinct departments devoted to every facet of Italian cuisine. Occupying the ground floor of what used to be the old ""Toy Building,"" there's no place in the 42,500-square-foot store where you can see everything. Apparently, the layout and design are almost identical to that of the original location in Turin, established in 2007.

Also direct from Italy were many of the store's employees, not only helpful and charming clerks, but Marco Michelis (son of Eataly Torino's pasta maker) in charge of fresh pasta, and Luca Montersino, pastry chef, who has charge of both pastry and the excellent gelato made fresh every day (try the pistachio).

Eataly is not a place for bargains, but prices here are in line with what you'd pay at an Italian specialty store or Whole Foods. And the selection is simply unparalleled, better than anything I've seen in this country.

To wit:

Aisles and aisles of pasta, from Barilla (not the usual American-manufactured Barilla, but the stuff made in Italy) to the most rarefied artisanal brands. Nearby, fresh pasta is being made all day. Fettuccine, tagliarini, sheets of lasagna are all $6.80 a pound; filled pastas, such as ravioli del plin, the specialty of Turin, are upward of $10.

NewsDay,Boosting your immune system,"Last school year was a particularly brutal one, minor-illness-wise, for the Butler family, complete with runny noses, hacking coughs and the not-so-occasional stomach flu. So as we come to the tail end of a perfectly healthy, happy, snot-free summer and head back to school — with all those germs!

— Mom has decided to go on the offensive. My mission? To build up our immunity and prevent colds, viruses and infections as much as possible.

That can be a tall order, says Gerard Mullin, a Johns Hopkins Hospital internist and gastroenterologist. “The change of seasons weakens your immune system by draining your body’s neuroendocrine system and stressing it with the changes in day and night and coldness and warmth, all of which makes you more susceptible to catching a cold or flu.”

He notes that being forced back into crowded places such as classrooms doesn’t help matters, nor do changes to bedtime and wake-up routines.

“Going back to school and a stricter schedule, and not being able to hang out, sleep late and get up at 10: It’s a new rhythm and a different world for kids,” he explains. “Just like for the rest of us, not getting enough rest ... plus dealing with the elements, the changing weather and stressors like school or work, can really hamper immune function.”

But while it can be a challenge to boost immunity in this situation, it is possible, says Philip Tierno Jr., director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. “People tend to ... take special supplements figuring, ‘That will protect me,’ ” he says. “Well, no, your body is what you have to work on: You need to get your organ in perfect shape to be able to defend itself, because the normal body is well adapted to do that.”

Experts agree that getting yourself into shape starts with good, balanced nutrition.

That means avoiding processed foods, red meat and saturated fats; not overeating; and consuming produce and foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids, such as salmon, says Mullin, who is also a nutritionist.

“It’s interesting that in the fall, root vegetables like yams and carrots, which are all very rich in Vitamin A and antioxidants, which play a huge role in immunity, come up in our diet,” he explains. “If you focus on eating seasonal fruits and vegetables, you’ll get all of the immune-boosting vitamins and minerals you need without having to think about supplements.”

He adds that a wide variety of mushrooms, including shitakes and even plain old white buttons, have also been proven to improve immune function. And since, according to Mullin, it has now been firmly established that the gut is the center of immunity, he suggests regularly eating yogurt with probiotics, which help maintain healthy gut flora.

In addition to urging people to eat their way to an optimal defense against colds, viruses and the like, NYU’s Tierno, the author of “The Secret Life of Germs,” offers these tips, which he says are all backed by research:

—Get moving. Sedentary people are more likely than others to become ill. Exercise — even just a half-hour to an hour of walking — has been shown to keep you functioning and to boost immunity.

—Stay rested. It’s essential to get enough sleep — ideally 7 1/2 to nine hours — because proper rest helps the body repair injuries caused by stress, illness and invading organisms such as viruses.

—Don’t stress. Stress hormones can make you more susceptible to infection. So try not to get worked up over that resurgent rush-hour traffic and focus on maintaining a less confrontational and low-stress lifestyle.

—Look on the bright side. Optimistic people tend to have a better immune response.

—Drink up. If you feel a cold coming on, consume plenty of fluids. This helps keep your organ systems functioning optimally and is very important for proper immune response.

—Avoid germs. Many people don’t follow basic rules of hygiene.

Tierno said it’s important to wash or sanitize your hands frequently — such as after using that germy shared pen at the supermarket — and to steer clear of coughing, sneezing or otherwise obviously ill people.

—Get a flu shot. This is one of the simplest means of staying well, particularly for the very young, for older people and for those whose immune systems are compromised.

And what about supplements? While drugstore shelves are filled with a plethora of powders and products touting their immune-boosting benefits, the evidence on effectiveness is decidedly lacking.

“There’s all types of stuff out there, but even for patients who do have quite significant suppression of the immune system from cancer or HIV, really no pharmacologic means have ever been successful in stimulating the immune system,” says physician David Parenti, an infectious-diseases expert at the George Washington University Medical Center, who doesn’t “think that high doses of any vitamins or other immune stimulants are necessary.”

Tierno does recommend taking around 2,000 to 3,000 IU (international units) of Vitamin D daily. But for the most part, claims about immune-boosting products “are bunk, because if you practice all of these diet and lifestyle rules you are going to be getting enough amino acids and vitamins already,” explains Tierney, who says he hasn’t been sick in more than five years.

A true mensch, Zohn, who won a cool $1 million -- and two goats -- on ""Survivor,"" could have taken his dough and painted his adopted hometown, New York City, red. However, playing soccer near his ""Survivor"" location, with the kids in the Kenyan village of Wamba, pointed him in a different direction.

""I learned in the parking lot they were all HIV positive,"" Zohn said, ""and I decided then to do something good with my prize money.""

He co-founded Grassroot Soccer, which uses the power of people's love for and enjoyment of soccer in the fight against HIV and AIDS in programs for children in Africa, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. He said he believes soccer shows how to make good decisions and be leaders.

""We're saving these Grassroot kids' lives, literally,"" he said. ""They see their soccer coaches every day and they become role models in place of their alcoholic, AIDS-infected parents.""

Ethan said he is proud of the 350,000 kids that have graduated from the program.",27/08/2010
NewsDay,Home work: Removing bee colonies,"You might have seen honeybees busily scurrying from flower to flower in your garden. They're collecting pollen and nectar to feed their queen and brood, or baby bees, and keep their colony thriving, all the while inadvertently pollinating your plants so you can get more flowers, fruits, herbs and vegetables. You even might have seen a honeybee colony nestled into a garage door jamb or hanging like a pouch from a tree branch. Generally, they're not a problem, as the bees don't tend to be aggressive unless they feel threatened.

Deborah Aldea of Syosset found herself in just that predicament last spring, when she and her brother noticed hundreds of bees entering and exiting the house near the living room window. The pair treated the area with hornet spray, to no avail. And when they called an exterminator, they learned the insects weren't hornets at all; they were honeybees.

Aldea called Suburban Pest Management of Smithtown, which is experienced in removing hives without sacrificing bee colonies. After examining the situation and opening up a wall where bee activity was suspected, the company's apiarist, Craig Byer, discovered the colony extending into the ceiling from behind a second wall Aldea didn't even know existed. Byer gingerly removed the nest, including honeycombs, nectar, pollen, honey and brood. The combs were placed in empty frames, and a special vacuum was used to suck the bees gently into a box. Then, he transported the bees to Suburban's apiary in Smithtown, where the colony settled into a new hive.

Honeybees need an opening of only 5/8 inch to enter a structure and build a hive, so proper sealing is vital. It's important to call a pest control company or beekeeper to confirm that what you're dealing with are honeybees.

""Other pests can be killed, and there will be no concern about nesting material left behind,"" Byer said. ""But with honey bees, the nesting material will become a nesting site for other species, like hive beetles, wax moths and others,"" so it must be removed to avoid future infestations.

NewsDay,Shelter Island road to be named in soldier's honor,"ALBANY - A state road will be named for the late Lt. Joseph J. Theinert of Shelter Island, under a bill signed into law by Gov. David A. Paterson.

The Theinert law was among 83 announced Saturday by the governor, including ones to give consumers more information about rebates and to expand testing for HIV. Paterson also vetoed 23 bills, including ones that would provide more generous retirement benefits for government workers, which he said would add to New York's budget deficit.

On Shelter Island, a portion of Route 114 has been designated ""Lt. Joseph J. Theinert Memorial Way."" Theinert was killed on June 4 in Afghanistan while serving with the Army's 10th Mountain Division.

""This designation is a fitting tribute to a young man whose appreciation for Shelter Island and commitment to protecting the freedoms we cherish have touched an entire community,"" said State Sen. Kenneth LaValle (R-Port Jefferson), who sponsored the law with Assemb. Marc Alessi (D-Shoreham).

The rebate law requires stores to publicize whether rebates will be paid in cash or check, and if neither, whether charges are assessed on prepaid gift cards, store credits and other types of rebates.

The law's sponsors, Assemb. Audrey Pheffer and Sen. Jose Peralta, both Queens Democrats, said retailers are using rebates to lure shoppers and then not adequately disclosing the terms. ""Consumers have a right to know if the $150 rebate on the washing machine they are purchasing, for example, will be remitted to them in . . . cash or check, or if they will receive a prepaid card, subject to additional fees, for future use"" at the store, they said.

Paterson added the law would boost retail sales by reassuring shoppers they aren't being ripped off.

The governor also approved measures that experts predict will boost voluntary testing for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

One law allows patients to agree to HIV testing as part of a general consent for medical care that remains in effect until revoked or it expires. The law also requires all doctors and other health care providers to offer HIV testing to patients age 13 to 64.

""This legislation will increase HIV test rates, letting people learn their status and begin treatment at an earlier stage,"" Paterson said.

Another law removes barriers to drug addicts participating in needle exchange and syringe access programs.

Other new laws:

NewsDay,Prison for HIV-positive LI man on sex abuse charges,"The young man said he trusted Robert Musmacker so much that he introduced his friends to the Oceanside man. He said he didn't know Musmacker was infected with the virus that causes AIDS when he had sex with him.

The man, the sole victim who spoke Wednesday at Musmacker's sentencing in Suffolk County Court, said he found out from news reports after Musmacker's December 2008 arrest on sex abuse charges that the former independent newspaper delivery depot employee was HIV positive.

Musmacker, 38, was sentenced by County Court Judge Barbara Kahn to 14 years in prison after he admitted last month that he had unprotected sex with nine boys and men between the ages of 16 and 20.

""He messed me up,"" said the victim, who is not being identified by Newsday because he is a victim of a sex crime. The man was 16 when he had sex with Musmacker, Assistant District Attorney Laurie Moroff told reporters.

""I trusted him,"" the man said in court. ""Why would he do that to us?""

He added that he believes Musmacker's sentence is not long enough. ""I think he's going to strike again,"" he said.

The victim declined to speak to reporters outside court.

Musmacker pleaded guilty in June to a 25-count indictment charging him with first-degree reckless endangerment, third-degree criminal sexual act and endangering the welfare of a child.

At his guilty plea, Musmacker said he had known since 2005 he was HIV positive, but did not tell his victims he had the virus. Prosecutors have said they don't believe Musmacker infected his victims.

Musmacker declined to speak in court Wednesday.

Moroff said Musmacker plied his victims with alcohol, marijuana and gifts such as cell phones to have sex with them.

""These were boys who had nothing,"" she said. ""They live in fear of being exposed to a disease for which there is no known cure.""

After the sentencing, Musmacker's mother, Angelina, wept outside the courtroom. She shouted at the victim who had spoken in court as he walked down the hall with prosecutors and court officers.

""The moocher lied,"" Angelina Musmacker told reporters as she left the courthouse, referring to the victim. She did not elaborate.

Before pronouncing the sentence, Kahn refused to allow Musmacker to withdraw his guilty pleas. She said Musmacker had written a letter to her saying he had pleaded guilty after he had been ""threatened and coerced"" by Moroff.

In addition to the prison term, Kahn sentenced Musmacker to 15 years of post-release supervision.",21/07/2010
NewsDay,"Jewish, more or less, in the South","It's impossible to be authentic if you don't know who you are. That's the moral of Alfred Uhry's ""The Last Night of Ballyhoo,"" a drama set in Atlanta during the 1939 premiere of ""Gone With the Wind.""

As the play, movingly directed by Pamela Seiderman, opens on Michael Hetzer's handsome antique set at Hofstra, we find an assimilated Jewish family decorating a Christmas tree. Only when daughter Lala (Molly Bier) tops the ""Hanukkah bush"" with a star does her mom, Boo, played with a frosty bite by Karen Rowan, object. Her affably wacky sister-in-law Reba (Ginger Dalton) rarely objects to anything. Boo's brother, Adolph (agreeable Dan Odell), the breadwinning head of a bedding company, knows better than to cross the women who share his home.

Adolph has brought a guest. Joe, the ""other kind"" as Boo says later - a Jew of Eastern European descent - who is offended by the tree but politely stifles his opinion. Earnestly played by Brian Gill, Joe is Adolph's new hire. When Adolph sends him north on business, he asks Joe to check on his other niece, aptly named Sunny (Christina Corsaro), who's taking a train home from college.

Ballyhoo, a cotillion for a certain class of Jews, is the big social event over the holidays. Sunny claims she could care less until Joe, seeking any excuse to date her, asks her to Ballyhoo. Lala settles for Peachy (Joe Hoffman), a prankster redhead of ""our kind."" Peachy's careless remark spoils the evening, but causes Sunny to question the nonobservance of her religious heritage. You're unlikely to hear a more meaningful Shabbat shalom on any stage.

Music pays the 'rent'

At Theatre Three, ""Rent"" is all about the music.

Jonathan Larson's tale is familiar by now, loosely based on Puccini's ""La Bohème,"" centering around filmmaker Mark (Jim Sluder) and rock musician Roger (Danny Amy). Penniless, they can't pay the rent for their Alphabet City apartment, where Roger meets and falls for drug-addicted Mimi (Brittany Lacey), who, like him, is HIV positive. A friend (Dewayne Queen-Jackson) is mugged outside their building. A transvestite (Jose Torres) comes to his rescue and they, too, fall in love. Meanwhile, Mark's love life is in shambles as beautiful Maureen (Emily Prochnicki) has left him for Joanne (Angela Retequiz).

As co-directed by Jeffrey Sanzel and choreographer Edward Carignan, the exuberant ensemble numbers, particularly ""There's Only Today"" and ""Seasons of Love,"" carry the show through rough patches in accommodating the 15 players on a narrow stage, plus an odd casting choice. (Sluder delivers, as usual, but it's a stretch to count him as part of the youth culture.)

NewsDay,Study: Vaginal gel cuts HIV infections by half,"Scientists said Monday that a gel for women had cut the rate of HIV infections in South Africa as much as 54 percent, suggesting a potentially effective way to block male-to-female viral transmission.

Results of the clinical trial of the gel, made by a California biotech company, are expected to be presented Tuesday at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, marking a milestone in developing medication to prevent HIV infection in women. Past attempts at similar medications produced a series of at least a half dozen failed results.

""The field of vaginal gels and microbicides has been going on for years and most of the results have been disappointing,"" said Dr. Roy Steigbigel, a microbiologist at Stony Brook University who is testing other forms of therapy to combat HIV. ""Obviously, if this is efficacious it would be beneficial to women.""

Women who used the gel 80 percent of the time, both before and after sex, received the greatest benefit, their infection rate lowered by more than 50 percent. Overall, results showed a 39 percent reduction, which included women who were not as compliant.

The study included 445 participants.

The gel contains the anti-HIV medication tenofovir, made by Gilead Sciences of Foster City, Calif. The two-year marks the first time such an approach has provided protection against HIV.

""Women represent the majority of new HIV infections globally and urgently need methods they can control to protect themselves from infection,"" said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the national center for HIV/AIDS at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""It is also very encouraging that the study found that the microbicide significantly reduced the risk of genital herpes, which is common in developing countries and in the United States,"" said Fenton. Genital herpes facilitates HIV transmission.

The trial was overseen by a research consortium in South Africa. Infectious disease experts in the United States say the study's results would have to be confirmed here and the medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the research is ""a significant milestone both for the microbicide research field and HIV prevention as a whole.""

He added that research is under way in the United States involving the same drug, but in pill form, not gel. The government-supported research, he said, is aimed at discovering whether the medication's tablet form can prevent infection.",19/07/2010
NewsDay,"HIV linked more to poverty than race, study finds","ATLANTA - Poverty is perhaps the most important factor in whether inner-city heterosexuals are infected with the AIDS virus, according to the first government study of its kind.

The study, released yesterday, suggests that HIV is epidemic in certain poverty-stricken urban neighborhoods. And, more significantly, poor heterosexuals in those areas were twice as likely to be infected as heterosexuals who lived in the same community but had more money.

Federal scientists found that there were no significant differences between blacks and whites, or Hispanics.

Health officials have long believed that poverty drives HIV epidemics, but there have been few studies to back that up. ""In the United States, we haven't had a history of looking in depth at the association between poverty and HIV,"" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of HIV/AIDS Prevention for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mermin oversees the CDC team that did the study.

The study involved a survey in 2006 and 2007 of 9,000 heterosexual adults, ages 18 to 50. They answered questions about their income, condom use and other details and were given HIV tests. The research was done in high-poverty neighborhoods in 23 U.S. cities. It focused on heterosexuals who don't use intravenous drugs.

The results: HIV was detected in 2.4 percent of the people who were living below the federal poverty line, which in 2007 was an annual income of roughly $10,000 or less for an individual.

Infections were found in 1.2 percent of people in the same neighborhoods who live above the poverty line. The results suggest people in low-income neighborhoods are likelier to be infected because they live among more infected people.",19/07/2010
NewsDay,36 arrested in Medicare scams totaling $280M,"MIAMI - Federal authorities said Friday they are conducting the largest Medicare fraud bust ever in five different states and arrested dozens of suspects accused in scams totaling $251 million.

Several doctors and nurses were among those arrested in Miami, New York City, Detroit, Houston and Baton Rouge, La., accused of billing Medicare for unnecessary equipment, physical therapy and HIV treatments that patients typically never received. Ninety-four suspects were indicted, and authorities said 36 people had been arrested as of Friday morning.

More than 360 agents participated in Friday’s raids, announced by Attorney General Eric Holder and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a health care fraud prevention summit in Miami. Officials said they chose Miami because it is ground zero for Medicare fraud. Authorities indicted 33 suspects in the Miami area, accused of charging Medicare for about $140 million in various scams.

Cleaning up an estimated $60 billion to $90 billion a year in Medicare fraud will be key to paying for President Barack Obama’s proposed health care overhaul. Federal officials have promised more money and manpower to fight fraud, setting up strike forces in several cities.

Around the country, the schemes have morphed from the typical medical equipment scam in which clinic owners billed Medicare dozens of times for the same wheelchair, while never giving the medical equipment to patients. Now, officials say, the schemes involve a sophisticated network of doctors, clinic owners, patients and patient recruiters.

Violent criminals and mobsters are also tapping into the scams, seeing Medicare fraud as more lucrative than dealing drugs and having less severe criminal penalties, officials said.

For instance, agents bugged a medical center in Brooklyn, where eight people are charged with running a $50 million scam that submitted bogus claims for physical therapy. Clinic owners paid patients, including undercover agents, in exchange for using their Medicare numbers and a bonus fee for recruiting new patients. Recording devices captured hundreds of kickback payments in a private room where a man sat at a table and did nothing but pay patients all day, authorities said.

In a separate Brooklyn case, authorities indicted six patients who shopped their Medicare numbers to various clinics. More than 3,744 claims were submitted on behalf of one woman in the past six years. The patients did not receive the services billed to Medicare, authorities said.

“Today’s arrests illustrate how health care fraud schemes can replicate virally and migrate rapidly across communities,” said Daniel R. Levinson, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare.

Federal authorities launched a strike force in Miami in 2007 to target the problem. The program has since expanded to seven cities and is responsible for more than 720 indictments that collectively have billed the Medicare program for more than $1.6 billion.

Miami-Dade County received about $520 million from Medicare in home health care payments intended for the sickest patients in 2008, which is more than the rest of the country combined, according to a federal report. Only 2 percent of the patients live here.

It used to take 90 days before the government detected a scam. By then, the crooks were long gone, sometimes with millions of dollars. Now authorities get billing data as it’s submitted, allowing them to catch suspects in real time, “as opposed to the typical pay and chase model we’ve had for years,” said Gerald Roy, assistant inspector general for investigations.",16/07/2010
NewsDay,UN: HIV among young people down in Africa,"LONDON - The number of young people infected with HIV in Africa is falling in 16 of the 25 countries hardest hit by the virus, according to a new report by a U.N. agency.

The number of young people infected with HIV dropped by at least 25 percent in a dozen countries, the U.N. AIDS report said. In Kenya, the infection rate among people aged 15 to 24 fell from about 14 percent in 2000 to 5.4 percent in urban areas.

The drop in HIV rates coincided with a change in sexual behavior, like having fewer sexual partners or increased condom used, UNAIDS said. But the agency could not say the drop was because of recent U.N. policies, which have mainly focused on buying AIDS drugs rather than preventing infections.

Some experts said new focus on prevention was too little, too late.

“Thanks to the U.N.’s strategic blunder, many more people are now infected than would have otherwise been the case had they focused on prevention much earlier,” said Philip Stevens, a health policy expert at International Policy Network.

The UNAIDS data were based on population surveys and mathematical modeling, and come with a significant margin of error.

“Young people have shown that they can be change agents in the (AIDS) prevention revolution,” UNAIDS wrote in its report.

The research provides further evidence the AIDS outbreak peaked more than a decade ago and that the disease is on the decline. In a report last year, the agency said the number of people infected with HIV had remained unchanged — at about 33 million — for the last two years.

UNAIDS also called for more money to combat the epidemic. In 2008, the world spent more than $15 billion on AIDS, with about half of that coming from the United States. In its report, UNAIDS said that “what’s been good for the AIDS response has been good for global health in general.”

But a study published last month found there was little correlation between U.S. money spent on AIDS and improvements in other health areas across Africa.

UNAIDS called for countries to invest more in their own HIV programs. It noted South Africa and Nigeria, two of Africa’s wealthiest countries, receive the most money from international donors.

Stevens said that while some recent AIDS investments — like putting more people on drugs — have clearly saved lives, it has also distorted health spending. Despite only causing 4 percent of deaths, AIDS gets about 20 cents of every public health dollar.

“The same amount of money that we spend on AIDS could save many, many more lives more cheaply by vaccinating children or distributing cheap treatments for diarrhea,” he said.

“Aid agencies have a responsibility to ensure they save the most lives possible with the amount of money they have available,” he said. “Spending the lion’s share on HIV clearly does not do that. ”",13/07/2010

Up until now, the best antibodies researchers have discovered only kill between 30 to 40 percent of HIV strains.

This new discovery brings hope to those aiming to create a vaccine, Dr. Gary Nabel of the NIAID told Reuters.

“I am more optimistic about an AIDS vaccine at this point in time than I have been probably in the last 10 years.”",09/07/2010
NewsDay,A backyard abuzz with bees,"Honeybees play a crucial role in pollinating our food crops and other plants. Their job is so vital to our food supply that professional beekeepers are hired to truck their hives from farm to farm during the growing season when there aren't enough native pollinators to do the job. But not all beekeepers work the commercial circuit; there are many amateurs who are in it simply for the love of bees and honey.

Honeybees are social insects that live together in a colony. While collecting nectar from plants, they transfer pollen from flower to flower, which enables fertilization and the subsequent production of fruits, vegetables and seeds. The bees convert the nectar into honey, a carbohydrate vital to their survival. Because they don't perish over the winter - like bumblebees do - honeybees produce an excess amount of honey, which they store away for the winter. And if provided with extra space in the hive, they will continue to produce more than they need, and the extra can be collected for human consumption.

Just to clear up any misconceptions: Barring allergies, honeybees are always a welcome presence in the garden. They aren't aggressive and usually don't attack unless they sense a threat against themselves or the hive. Stepping on or swatting a bee would qualify as a perceived threat, as would invading a hive. (Remember Winnie the Pooh? He was the aggressor.) But gardening alongside a few busy bees seldom results in a sting. And contrary to popular belief, yellow jackets aren't bees at all; they're a kind of wasp, and yes, they often attack without provocation, so avoid them when you can. For honeybees, a sting is a weapon of last resort: An attack ensures the bee's certain death because the insect's stinger is torn from its abdomen when it withdraws. Yellow jackets, on the other hand, will sting you a dozen times and live to laugh about it with their friends. Big difference.

Armed - and consoled - with that knowledge, I spent an afternoon recently with Rich Blohm, a master beekeeper who keeps 50 hives at his High Meadow Honey Farm in Huntington. He also maintains the hives at Richter's Orchard in Northport, where he showed me the tricks of his trade.

Blohm is a pest exterminator, a line of work he found as a result of his beekeeping. ""I would get calls from people who said they had swarms of bees, but often it would turn out they were wasps, so I would eradicate them,"" he explained. After learning it is against the law to spray a pesticide on someone else's property without a license, Blohm obtained a license, and a new career was born.

Meeting the queen

After donning a protective bee jacket and screened veil, I approached the hive area with Blohm, who burned pine needles in a metal smoker and directed the smoke into all the cracks and crevices in a hive, a structure about 20 inches wide and 2 feet tall. Smoke calms the bees, he explained. We were, after all, invading their territory, and their natural instincts would be to protect the hive.

Next, using a special hive tool, he lifted off the wooden cover and pried open the hive, which the bees had glued shut with resinthey produced. He lifted out a bee-covered frame and let me hold it. Blohm pointed out the queen, larger than the others, and as we examined dozens of bees working diligently to groom and feed and care for her, she unexpectedly lowered the rear portion of her abdomen into a comb and deposited an egg, right before our eyes. Her job, it turns out, is simply to lay eggs all day. But Blohm said it was unusual that she would do so outside of the dark confines of the hive.

The entire experience was surprisingly tranquil. The gentle buzzing sounds lulled us into a calm sense of oneness with the bees, which didn't seem to mind our presence at all. I even removed my suit and veil, and Blohm picked up bees with his bare fingers. Neither of us was stung.

After spending just a few hours with Blohm and his hives, I was sold on a relaxing hobby that can reward you with many years of enjoyment, pollination for your plants and trees, and lots of honey for your table.",03/07/2010
NewsDay,OPINION: 10th anniversary of genome mapping offers change to take stock,"Dr. James P. Evans is editor-in-chief of the journal Genetics in Medicine, the official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics, and the Bryson Distinguished Professor of genetics and medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

It's now been 10 years since humans deciphered the digital code that, in a very real sense, defines us as a species. It's hard to overestimate the significance of that achievement - but easy to misconstrue what it means and where its true promise lies.

The philosophical import of having the human genetic code in hand is remarkable, and we've learned much that is fascinating. For example, we scientists were surprised (and humbled) to discover that it takes only about 22,000 genes to build a human being - half the number it takes for corn to get on with its business. The Human Genome Project, which came in ahead of schedule and under budget (at about $3 billion), with important parts of the work completed at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, has also shed light on some very big questions about human ancestry and evolutionary biology.

But the project wasn't sold to the American people in order to answer evolutionary questions, ferret out how humans populated the globe or discover interesting factoids, no matter how fascinating or important these subjects might be. No, what the American people want from their investment is better medical care, and it was this promise that fueled the project's funding and its popularity.

Now at the 10-year mark, we are witnessing arguments about whether mapping the human genome was worth the money and effort. People are asking where all that genomic medicine is that we were promised a decade ago. So it's a good time to take stock of where current and future genomic payoffs might reside and where we may have fallen short.

But it's also a rare opportunity to illuminate more fundamental issues related to the nature of scientific progress, how the public and scientists communicate, and what we really should expect from science.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

The Human Genome Project has certainly yielded some practical benefits to clinical medicine. One of the near-term successes is the field of pharmacogenomics, in which knowledge of a patient's genetic information is used to guide drug choice and dosing.

Specific agents - such as abacavir for the treatment of HIV, and clopidogrel, a drug widely used to reduce the risk of heart attack - can be more precisely prescribed now that we understand how individuals' genetic constitutions influence their responses to these agents. Pharmacogenomic approaches won't be applicable to every drug - but for select agents, knowledge derived from the Human Genome Project is already improving the care of patients.

In another near-term advance, our ability to better diagnose rare genetic diseases (which are no less tragic to those who have them simply because they are rare) is gaining tremendous traction due to knowledge and technology propelled by the project.

We've gained insight into the molecular underpinnings of many common diseases and found variants in the population that are related to an individual's risk of almost every disease imaginable. This knowledge will provide long-term benefit through new drug targets and better understanding of those diseases.

But any direct or practical payoff from such knowledge is years away. The idea that you will benefit in any tangible manner from knowing whether you are at an increased or decreased risk of, say, heart disease, is a fool's hope - in spite of early delusions by scientists and a fledgling direct-to-consumer genetic testing industry that would have you believe otherwise. The simple fact remains that whether you are at double or half the population's average risk for a given common disease isn't very important - you are still highly likely to develop them. That's why they're called common diseases!

Moreover, we've known for a long time how to prevent such diseases: Eat right, drink responsibly, exercise and don't smoke. Your mom was right. As could have been predicted by any practicing physician 20 years ago, parsing an individual's risk for most such diseases adds little to information easily gained by taking a brief family history, asking a few questions and ushering you onto a scale.

As in all scientific pursuit, the true promise of deciphering the human genome lies in the gradual and incremental accrual of basic knowledge. Ultimately, the better we understand ourselves and our world, the better we will be able to act on that knowledge and improve our lives. Because of scientific progress, your life is unimaginably richer and more comfortable than that of any human who ever lived, even just a few generations ago. But the timeline is agonizingly long for the translation of scientific knowledge into practical benefit. The road to tangibly better lives from scientific insights is unpredictable and filled with dead ends and U-turns. That's the nature of science, and there are no shortcuts.

Both scientists and the public must come to terms with the true nature of science, or we will continuously have the same pointless debate about whether developments and discoveries live up to their promise. Scientists need to resist the temptation to oversell the short-term benefits likely to be derived from basic insights and advances. This is especially important in the realm of medical care, where the stakes are enormous, the variables are many and our chances of being misled are high.

Inflating an unrealistic bubble of expectations not only ignores the reality of how science works, but it is bad politics on the part of scientists. For when the bubble bursts and the cool things we've been promised don't materialize (where the hell is my hover car, anyway?) legitimate scientific pursuit suffers to the detriment of all.

But it's not all the scientists' fault. The media must resist feeding the bubble of unrealistic expectations in search of the next good story. And, finally, the public has a responsibility to understand the nature of science, to shed simplistic expectations, and to fund quality basic research with its tax dollars without expecting immediate benefits.

Just as scientific knowledge has transformed our lives (mostly) for the better over and over again, the Human Genome Project too will transform medicine and was well worth the cost. Its payoffs will be pervasive but will be predictably incremental - evolutionary rather than revolutionary.",27/06/2010

About a third of the way through the set, though, Drake impressed the exuberant cross section of sneakerheads, bloggers and industry honchos by sending a heartfelt shout-out to L.A. ""This is the most important show on this tour for me,"" he said. ""The most important show I'ma do.""

Which is a curious thing for any MC with a substantial coast-to-coast fan base to say, let alone one whose ""Away From Home"" world tour will take him to such hip-hop hotbeds as New York, New Orleans and London. (Drake's free show last Tuesday at South Street Seaport was canceled after nearly double the 10,000 expected fans showed up and some became unruly.)

After his L.A. show, Drake made his point clear. ""I knew word would get back from here to everybody I've worked with, probably everybody I have ever idolized,"" he said, snuggling beneath a fur blanket, clearly fatigued. ""People were coming out like, 'All right, here's your shot here in Hollywood. What are you made of? They say you're the guy to watch, and we're going to come and judge.' I wanted to prove a lot.""

Lion's roaring success

The artist also known as ""Drizzy"" had grown somewhat accustomed to the relentless pace of life on the road. But will he be able to cope with every vagary of nascent rap stardom?

After a relatively meteoric rise from hip-hop anonymity, scoring two Top 10 hits off his self-released mixtape, ""So Far Gone,"" snagging two Grammy nominations last year and triggering a major label bidding war (which resulted in a lucrative deal with Aspire/Young Money/Cash Money Records that's distributed through Universal Motown), Drake, 23, has been unofficially anointed hip-hop's new Young Lion. To be sure, he's the foremost rhymesayer under 30 - save, perhaps, for Drake's mentor Lil Wayne, who's serving a one-year prison sentence.

Drizzy Drake is the genre's go-to guy for a quick hit and has already collaborated with the platinum-plus likes of Eminem, Jamie Foxx, Alicia Keys and Young Jeezy.

Still, the arrival of his debut album, ""Thank Me Later,"" which came out last week, marks a new stage in his grand unveiling. And he owned up to feeling a certain obligation to deliver. ""A lot of people are treating this not like it's my first album, but like it's my last album,"" he said. ""It could be my last if it's not that great.""

In an era when album sales are sagging and the urban music world remains more fixated on racking up ringtone sales than nurturing artists, the accepted wisdom remains that it is easier to build an audience for a new performer than to create loyalty among listeners.

In the view of XXL magazine senior editor Benjamin Meadows-Ingram, Drake is ""the No. 1 draft pick, a legitimate career player"" in hip-hop right now. But at this time when the idea of an artist shifting more than a million copies in first-week sales seems to belong to a bygone era - Meadows-Ingram feels the metric of success for ""Thank Me Later"" will be something other than the raw numbers.

""He's able to enter the market at a time when people have diminished expectations,"" Meadows-Ingram said. ""You have to ask, 'Did the album artistically perform the way you wanted it to?'""

Schooled on 'DeGrassi'

Considered within that context, Drake's career so far has been a triumph of profile management and controlled bursts of envelope pushing. The half-Jewish, Toronto-born performer (born Aubrey Drake Graham) transcended his earlier renown as a TV star - he portrayed Jimmy, a wheelchair-bound high school Lothario from 2001 to '08 on the popular teen drama ""DeGrassi: The Next Generation"" - to construct an alternate persona as a hip-hop star.

""I'm just grateful I'm not just the kid off 'DeGrassi' anymore,"" he said. ""Everybody on 'DeGrassi,' the producers, made us feel 'DeGrassi' was the biggest thing we would ever do in our lives, like that was the end of the road for all of us.""

From there, musical success followed in short order: rap rainmaker Lil Wayne took him under his wing in 2008, giving the new jack's street credibility and currency an immeasurable boost. Then, Drake self-distributed the epochal mixtape EP ""So Far Gone,"" which sold hundreds of thousands of iTunes downloads and yielded the single ""Best I Ever Had."" It topped the R&B/hip-hop chart for seven weeks, helping spark a major label bidding war and paving the way for a nationwide tour.

On many of his most memorable songs (""Successful,"" ""Over""), Drake articulates a mixture of lyrical braggadocio and material disillusionment that seems somehow poignant at a time of global recession - when hip-hop seems to be going through a pronounced soul-searching phase. Meanwhile, he stands out from the rest of the current freshman pack (B.o.B., Kid Cudi, Wale, et al) by blending no-nonsense rapping (that owes a conscious debt to Kanye West) with an alt-R&B singing style (bearing a heavy helping of the pitchcorrecting computer program Auto-Tune).

Viewed another way, Drake fits into a continuum of rap debutantes that includes West and Queens hard-core MC 50 Cent, both of whom similarly generated a deafening hive of buzz before either of their debut albums came out. ""Hip-hop is all about moments,"" Drake said. ""You look at people who were hot three or four years ago who are sitting around reminiscing. It's fickle. I'm the moment right now.""

Recording for ""Thank Me Later"" began in October. Of the album's 14 cuts, half include collaborations with hit makers: Jay-Z (""Light Up"") and Alicia Keys (""Fireworks"") as well as producer-singer The-Dream, Southern rappers T.I., Young Jeezy and Drake's label mates Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj. West produced two songs, including what Drake terms his first out-and-out mainstream effort, ""Find Your Love.""

""I didn't go the safe route,"" Drake said. ""I could have put somebody on every song. I don't want people to be able to say, 'He got so much assistance on this album and didn't work hard enough.' ""

Already musing about calling his second album ""Moments,"" he directly contradicted the opening verse of ""Forever"" to address his current position within hip-hop and look toward the future.

""I don't feel like I'm a great rapper right now,"" Drake said, rubbing his forehead and stifling a yawn. ""I feel I'm good at what I do. But I want to be - if not the best - I want to reach my personal best. I just want to be better, man. That's all.""",17/06/2010
NewsDay,FDA: 'Female Viagra' falls short,"A pink pill designed to boost sex drive in women — the latest attempt by the drug industry to find a female equivalent to Viagra — fell short in two studies, federal health regulators said Wednesday.

The Food and Drug Administration is considering Boehringer Ingelheim's drug flibanserin for premenopausal women who report a lack of sexual desire, a market that drugmakers have been targeting for more than a decade since the blockbuster success of Viagra in men.

The search for so-called ""female Viagra,"" has proved elusive though, with many drugs abandoned after showing lackluster results.

On Friday the FDA will ask a panel of experts to weigh in on the safety and effectiveness of Boehringer's drug. The agency is not required to follow the group's advice, though it often does.

In its review posted online, the FDA said two Boehringer studies failed to show a significant increase in sexual desire, as recorded by women in a daily journal. Women taking the drug reported slightly more sexually satisfying experiences, but FDA said that was not the primary measure of the study.

""The division wanted to see that an effect of treatment is an overall increase in sexual desire regardless of whether a sexual event occurred or not,"" states the FDA review.

The FDA also noted increased side effects like depression, fainting and dizziness seen among women taking the pink pill.

The drug, which is related to the antidepressant family, affects serotonin and several other brain chemicals, though it's not clear how that increases sex drive.

""We don't know specifically what the exact mechanism of action is but we believe it acts on brain chemicals that have a role in human sexual response,"" said Dr. Peter Piliero, executive director for Boehringer's U.S. medical affairs.

Since the launch of Viagra in 1998, more than two dozen experimental therapies have been studied for so-called ""female sexual dysfunction,"" a market which some analysts estimate at $2 billion.

Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, says arousal in women is so complicated that it may be unrealistic to expect a pill to completely address sexual problems.

""It's a fairly complicated area, unlike in men's sexual dysfunction where there's a major mechanical concern,"" said Kavaler. ""In women there's no mechanical concern, so if she's not having a successful sex life, where is the problem?""

Pharmaceutical approaches to boosting female libido have evolved over time. Initially, most treatments aimed to increase blood flow to the genitals, similar to Viagra. A second wave of would-be blockbusters focused on boosting hormones, including testosterone, which is linked to sexual interest. Flibanserin is the first drug to approach the problem through brain chemistry.

The FDA has approved an unusual handheld vacuum device that increases blood flow to the clitoris to increase sexual arousal. But all drug therapies have fallen short so far.

In 2004, Pfizer halted its study of Viagra in women due to inconclusive results. Later that year an FDA panel rejected Procter & Gamble's testosterone patch Intrinsa, due to potential risks of heart disease and cancer. Smaller companies are currently developing creams and nasal sprays to increase female libido.

BioSante Pharmaceuticals Inc. expects to submit its testosterone gel LibiGel for FDA approval next year.

Medical surveys have estimated more than 40 percent of women suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction; Boehringer estimates as many as one in 10 women could be helped by its drug.

Boehringer tried to zero in on the chemical aspect of sexual dysfunction by only testing its drug on premenopausal women who were in stable relationships and not taking other medications. Despite wanting to have a sexual relationship, the women enrolled in company studies reported a persistent lack of desire that caused them ""distress or interpersonal difficulty.""

Leonore Tiefer, a psychiatry professor at New York University who runs a private sex therapy practice, believes drugmakers have oversimplified female sexuality. She says in most cases lack of sex drive has more to do with the quality of one's relationship and lifestyle than brain chemicals.

During the public comment period at Friday's meeting, Tiefer will ask the FDA to reject flibanserin , arguing it offers meager benefits for women with unknown long-term risks.

The modest results reported by Boehringer have also cooled Wall Street's expectations for the drug.

Decision Resources analyst Alasdair Milton said he expects flibanserin sales to peak at $300 million after six or more years on the market. By comparison, male sexual dysfunction drugs including Viagra, Cialis and others posted combined sales of $4.4 billion last year, according to health care data firm IMS Health.

Privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim posted sales of $12 billion last year. The Ingelheim, Germany -based company makes a range of prescription drugs for heart disease, HIV and other diseases.",16/06/2010
NewsDay,Defense tries to discredit son of accused mobster,"Defense attorneys began cross-examining government witness John Franzese Jr. Thursday, portraying the former crack-cocaine addict as someone who never really had an insider's view of New York's Colombo crime family.

Franzese, 50, who grew up in Roslyn, is the federal government's star witness in its racketeering conspiracy trial that has cast him as chief accuser of his father, John ""Sonny"" Franzese Sr., 93, of Brooklyn, reputed underboss of the Colombo crime family; Joseph DiGorga of Oceanside, and two other men.

On Tuesday, John Franzese Jr. testified about audio recordings of conversations he had with his father during which crime family business was discussed, including those that allegedly caught his dad plotting to extort strip joints and discussing political arrangements for a club in Babylon.

But there was drama outside the courtroom when testimony ended. Sonny Franzese's estranged wife, Christine Capobianco Franzese, 75, of Selden, and John Jr.'s mother, was issued a citation for disorderly conduct.

Timothy E. Hogan, chief deputy with the U.S. Marshal Service in Brooklyn, said Capobianco pushed a family member in the hallway outside the courtroom. Outside the courthouse, Capobianco Franzese said that Lorraine Scorsone, of Brooklyn, pushed her in the arm, ""and I pushed back.""

She said she urged her husband to plead guilty.

""I went to tell Sonny to plead guilty and let him [John Jr.] get off the stand,"" Capobianco Franzese said. She spoke to Sonny Franzese when he was taken to the men's room.

Scorsone left the courthouse without comment.

In court Thursday, defense lawyer Richard Lind questioned Franzese about his past crimes, which included several robberies, that weren't conducted with the blessing of mob bosses.

""That's what a junkie like me does,"" Franzese testified, referring to his putting a gun to the head of one of his friends and taking $40 to buy drugs.

It came out in court that Franzese, who said he drove a Mercedes-Benz while in high school, was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1990. Lind pressed Franzese on whether payments made to him by the police in Los Angeles were for medication to treat his disease.

Franzese, who testified he got HIV from drug use, also testified that the payments, ""maybe $100 a week,"" were for expenses incurred while working as a police informant while in California.

Outside of court, Michael Franzese, John Jr.'s brother, said his brother's testimony about having intimate knowledge of his father's crime business - and his own work as a deliverer of mob messages for his father - wasn't true.

""My father never instructed him to get into this life,"" Michael Franzese said. ""It was through me. I was a made guy at the time. Our father was in prison for 30 years. We essentially grew up without a father.""

Michael Franzese, now a born-again Christian who says he's no longer part of the mob, said he wished his younger brother had ""got involved with the Lord"" because then he would ""never have been in this mess.""",10/06/2010
NewsDay,Health panel considers ending ban on gay blood donors,"WASHINGTON - A federal health panel is considering easing a long-standing ban on blood donations by most gay men amid a growing body of evidence that the sharpest restrictions may no longer be necessary and calls from lawmakers for a fresh look at the policy.

Gay advocacy groups and organizations representing hemophiliacs and other heavy users of blood products also have narrowed their differences over the need to adjust rules for who can give blood.

At issue in a two-day hearing by the Department of Health and Human Services' Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability starting today is the quarter-century-old donor policy, which bars any man who has had sex even once with another man since 1977 from ever donating blood.

The restrictions were put in place in the early days of the HIV-AIDS crisis after it became clear that gay men were at increased risk of getting and transmitting HIV and other infectious diseases.

The Food and Drug Administration estimates that gay men likely to donate blood have an HIV infection rate 15 times higher than the general population.

Pressure for a review of the policy has been building for several years, driven by improvements in testing.

There were nine cases of HIV known to have been transmitted via blood products between 1994 and 2002 and none, in tens of millions of transfusions, between 2002 and 2007, the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has complete data.

In 2006 the American Red Cross and two other blood banking groups, which between them collect almost all of the blood in the United States, recommended permitting gay men to donate blood if they abstained from sex for one year.

Two years later, the American Medical Association also urged an end to the broad ban, though it advised a five-year waiting period before donation.

Last December, Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) and nine other House members asked the FDA to revisit the issue and, three months later, so did a group of senators led by John Kerry (D-Mass.).",09/06/2010
NewsDay,AIDS-infected man admits to unprotected sex,"An AIDS-infected Oceanside man once called ""a walking public health menace"" by District Attorney Thomas Spota admitted Monday that he had unprotected sex with nine young men and boys, some as young as 16.

Robert Musmacker, 37, pleaded guilty in Riverhead to a 25-count indictment, including charges of first-degree reckless endangerment, third-degree criminal sexual act and endangering the welfare of a child. Judge Barbara Kahn said she would sentence Musmacker on July 13 to 14 years in prison, followed by the maximum 15 years of post-release supervision.

Assistant District Attorney Laurie Moroff said she will recommend that Musmacker serve 18 years in prison. She said in court none of the victims had contracted AIDS.

Musmacker mouthed ""I love you"" to his mother, Angelina Musmacker, as he left court. She blew him a kiss. She declined to comment outside court.

Robert Musmacker admitted in court to having sex with his victims, the oldest of whom was 20, from 2007 to 2008. He said he did not tell his victims that he had known since October 2005 that he was HIV positive, and he said he did not use condoms or ask his victims to use condoms.

Musmacker's attorney, John Byrnes, said he felt Musmacker had no choice but to admit to the charges.

""The people's case was overwhelming,"" he said.

NewsDay,"Patients, groups eye off-label use of prescription drugs","When Sanford ""Sandy"" Gerber awoke the morning after his first Botox shots in his arm he wept openly with joy. He could unclench his fist for the first time in seven years.

Gerber, 60, of Melville, hadn't seen the palm of his hand since 2003 when a near-fatal stroke damaged his right side and also limited the use of his right leg. After his first Botox injections in March, Gerber said, his leg felt better, too.

""When my doctor gave me the shots he said I should be able to feel something in five to seven days,"" said Gerber, the former manager of a Starbucks in Manhasset, now on permanent disability. ""But the next morning I was able to turn my palm to my face, and I said to myself: 'Oh my God.' ""

His treatment came the same month the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Botox and two similar drugs for treating stroke-affected arms and hands. But the approval arrived nearly 20 years after doctors worldwide began injecting stroke patients with the drug, which is best known as a wrinkle-eraser.

""I have been using botulinum toxin for over 10 years, and there are doctors who have been using it even longer,"" said Dr. John Kelemen, Gerber's Plainview neurologist.

The injections have not yet been approved for stroke-affected legs and feet. But doctors, including Gerber's, are continuing without approval in a practice known as ""off-label"" prescribing, when a medication is approved for one purpose but prescribed for another for which it has not been scientifically vetted. Doctors have engaged in the practice for decades based on anecdotal evidence and their own knowledge of diseases. Breast cancer and degenerative eye problems are among the dozens of medical maladies treated with drugs used off-label.

About 20 percent of all medications prescribed for adults are for off-label purposes, according to research from Stanford University and the Institute of Medicine, a federally chartered nonprofit organization that provides advice to government agencies, lawmakers and the public. But among certain drug classes, particularly heart medications, off-label prescribing may be as high as 46 percent. And for children, the institute estimates off-label prescribing may range between 50 percent and 75 percent because so few medications are tested for pediatric safety and correct dosages.

The practice is legal and strongly defended by the American Medical Association - and the FDA.

""The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine,"" said agency spokeswoman Sandy Walsh. ""Health care professionals are free to choose medicines for uses not approved by the FDA if they feel such use will benefit a patient's condition.""

She said the agency's role is to make certain drugs are safe and effective. The hands-on practice of medicine is regulated by state boards of medicine and pharmacy.

Botox is just one of dozens of medications prescribed off-label. Another drug, Avastin, first approved in 2004 for metastatic colon cancer, has been used off-label for years in patients with macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, two leading causes of blindness. Both are characterized by excessive blood vessel development in the retina.

Even though Genentech, Avastin's maker, manufactures an eye-specific drug that also thwarts the growth of blood vessels, doctors have forged ahead with off-label Avastin, saying it saves patients money.

Trend draws concerns

Off-label prescribing is common across a wide range of medical conditions - cancer, HIV infection, psychiatric disorders and rare diseases. A study presented last year at the American Society of Clinical Oncology revealed that more than one-third of breast cancer patients receive chemotherapy medications that, while FDA-approved, have not been vetted for the disease.

""The history of off-label use - and I don't think anybody has done a 50-year or 100-year survey - the general impression is that it has benefitted patients,"" said Dr. Samuel Packard, chairman of the ethics committee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System in Manhasset.

Freedom to prescribe drugs off-label encourages innovation in clinical practice, said Dr. Randall Stafford of Stanford University, a leading medical policy expert on the practice of off-label drug use.

But concerns also persist about the trend. Stafford also found in a study a slew of drugs that are inappropriately prescribed off-label. Most are anti-psychotics and anti-depressants.

Drugs prescribed off-label have not been studied well enough to determine if their benefits outweigh the risks, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog in Washington, D.C. The group contends a lack of clinical research means no scientific consensus exists on proper dosages.

Pharmaceutical companies do operate under one key restriction with their drugs that may become popular off-label: They're prohibited from advertising their products for purposes other than their approved uses. Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, pleaded guilty last month to illegally promoting its epilepsy drug Topamax for uses other than approved by the FDA.

Benefits of toxin

Botox, which is derived from the bacterial toxin that causes botulism poisoning, became a post-stroke treatment years before its approval. The theory behind it grew out of the work of a pioneering San Francisco ophthalmologist who used purified samples of the toxin in the early 1980s to treat uncontrolled muscle spasms around the eyes.

In 2001, Canada approved Botox to treat people who had suffered strokes. The drug works by blocking overactive nerve impulses that trigger excessive muscle contractions - what's known as ""spasticity.""

""It's interesting there is so little known about it in the public at large and so few neurologists are using it,"" Kelemen said. ""But we know it's appropriate and there have been peer-reviewed studies showing that botulinum toxin works in stroke.""

Injections of the toxin in stroke patients preceded most of the major scientific studies that ultimately validated the shots. But it was the research - not the anecdotal evidence - that provided the data on which the FDA's March approval was based.

Meanwhile, most insurers and Medicare pay for the injections in both the arms and legs because the shots dramatically improve life quality for stroke patients.

It is uncertain when - or if - the FDA will approve the botulinum-based drugs - Botox, Dysport and Myobloc - for lower limb injections. Even if they do gain approval, the treatments should not be seen as a permanent cure: Gerber is scheduled to receive a series of injections in his right arm and leg every three months. Still, he is now able to begin relearning how to use he right hand to write with a pen and use a knife and fork.

As for Kelemen, he said he feels gratified that he can help people who once seemingly were beyond help. ""With Sandy, you can hear it in his voice,"" he said. ""He really feels he has gotten his life back.""

Are off-label drugs right for you?

Drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a rigorous process involving laboratory testing that can take years. The labels eventually arrived at for pill bottles are in place in part to protect patients from harmful side effects. Even so, doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs off-label, for uses for which they have not been tested.

Experts suggest patients can ask the following questions if their doctor recommends an off-label drug prescription:

1. How do you know a medication prescribed off-label will work for me?

2. Have you treated other patients suffering similar symptoms with the same medication? What was the outcome?

3. May I talk to a few of your patients who have been treated off-label?

4. How many formal studies have been conducted showing that this off-label usage works for my condition?

Some drugs and their off-label uses

Dozens of drugs are prescribed off-label, meaning doctors use them to treat conditions for which they have not been tested. Some examples:

ACTOS: Diabetes drug (not FDA-approved for pediatric use)

Used off label for: Autism in children

Why: Some doctors theorize the drug may reduce inflammation and have other properties that help improve the quality of life for children with autism. Drug carries an FDA ""black box"" warning because researchers have linked it to heart failure in adults.

AVANDIA: Diabetes drug (not FDA-approved for children)

Used off-label for: Autism in children

Why: It is almost chemically identical to Actos, and so some doctors theorize the drug may reduce inflammation and have other properties that help improve the quality of life for children with autism. Drug carries a ""black box"" warning because of a link to heart failure in adults.

AVASTIN: Cancer drug

Used off-label for: Age-related macular degeneration/diabetic retinopathy

Why: Reduces development of destructive blood vessels in retina.

BOTOX: Blocks nerve activity in muscles

Used off-label for: Cerebral palsy in children; enlarged prostate gland; migraine headaches

Why: Cuts down on involuntary muscle contractions and improves movement in cerebral palsy; decreases size of prostate gland and helps improve urine flow; doctors theorize Botox may help migraine sufferers by reducing inflammation and decreasing activity of pain receptors. Botox carries a ""black box"" warning because of side effects in some patients.

LONG-TERM ANTIBIOTICS: Kills bacterial infections

Used off-label for: Lyme disease

Why: Some patients and their physicians contend Lyme infections are chronic, requiring long-term antibiotic therapy.

NEURONTIN (Gabapentin): Anticonvulsant

Used off-label for: Bipolar disorder; hot flashes and essential tremor

Why: Drug reduces depression and anxiety in some patients. Doctors theorize it helps quell hot flashes by regulating the flow of calcium in cells, a mechanism involved in body temperature. New York researchers proved the drug is as effective as estrogen in controlling hot flashes. Several clinical trials demonstrate the drug works to control essential tremor.",06/06/2010
NewsDay,Yankees Help Rwanda...,"The Yankees partnered with fair-trade company Same Sky Wednesday evening to honor the survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

The event -- which was hosted by Same Sky founder Francine LeFrak, Yankees Vice President and Assistant General Manager Jean Afterman, Mindy Franklin Levine, the wife of team president Randy Levine, and Sadye Zillo, the wife of PR director Jason Zillo – highlighted the HIV positive women artisans who have handcrafted bracelets through the organization’s trade-not-aid initiative to effect change in Rwanda.

Women within the Yankees organization — from the highest (i.e., Afterman) to the lowest – gathered at the H&R Block suite louge before yesterday’s game against the Orioles to buy bracelets and raise awareness.

And who better than the Yankees to get the message out.

“It makes sense because the Yankees brand is a global brand,” said Afterman, who is just the third female in MLB history to be a VP. “Baseball is not a big sports in Rwanda, but we’re using the power of the glbal band to raise awareness of Same Sky and it’s a way for working women to come out and support working women. The women of Same Sky do not want charity. It’s not a fundraiser.”

Also in attendance was the Honorable Agnes Gasana, wife of Rwandan Ambassador to the United Nations Eugene-Richard Gasana.

“This is a dream come true,” said LeFrak, who pointed out that Yankee-tinis were available at the bar and “Yankee Blue” bracelets were also being sold. “We started talking about this last season and to see it actually realized is beyond (words).

“Same Sky represents women empowering women and the men that support us and I think the women of the Yankees embraced it because they’re all about empowering and they bought the story of the same sky women who started life over. T give us courage because they survived the most unspeakable things and here they are, not getting aid, they’re getting trade. They’re getting a job, they’re getting dignity. And I think that the whole Yankee family embraced that story.”",02/06/2010
NewsDay,Eradication of smallpox may have spurred HIV,"LOS ANGELES - The worldwide eradication of smallpox in the mid-20th century was a remarkable public health achievement, but it may have set the stage for the HIV pandemic of the latter half of the century, researchers reported yesterday.

Lab tests suggest that immunity to smallpox triggered by the smallpox vaccine can inhibit the replication of the AIDS virus. Such vaccination could have kept HIV transmission partly under control in the early days of the outbreak, but withdrawal of the vaccine in the 1950s would have freed HIV to spread unfettered, the researchers said.

The most common form of HIV is thought to have evolved from a simian immunodeficiency virus found in chimpanzees of southern and western Africa sometime around 1931. It spread slowly until the mid- to late-1950s, when it began to spread exponentially.

Wars, misuse of medical equipment and contamination of a polio vaccine have been suggested as possible causes of the spread, but such theories have either been disproved or do not sufficiently explain the behavior of the HIV pandemic, said Dr. Raymond S. Weinstein of the biodefense program at George Mason University in Manassas, Va.

Weinstein and his colleagues noted that the progression of an HIV infection can be mitigated by a co-infection with certain other viruses, such as human herpesvirus 6 or 7 or the paramyxovirus that causes measles. Such viruses interfere with a cellular receptor of white cells that is also used by HIV. The vaccinia virus also blocks this receptor.

Given the great difficulties researchers have encountered in trying to develop an HIV vaccine, the ironic fact is that we may once have had a vaccine that is more effective against the virus than anything that has since been developed, and we threw it away.",18/05/2010
NewsDay,Latest attempt to block HIV seen in gels,"WASHINGTON — Try after try to make vaginal creams that could repel the AIDS virus have failed. Now researchers are testing if a drug used to treat HIV infection finally might give women a tool to prevent it — by infusing the medicine into vaginal gels and contraceptive-style rings.

Even quick-dissolving anti-HIV films are being created, the same style now used for breath-fresheners or allergy medicines but made for fingertip application in the vagina.

Called microbicides, this kind of woman-controlled protection is considered key to battling the HIV epidemic — especially in developing countries where the virus is at its worst and women too often can't get their partners to use a condom.

For two decades, scientists tried less powerful medications in disappointing microbicide attempts. Results from the first study to see if this new strategy works — South African women tested a gel made of the AIDS drug tenofovir — aren't due until July.

But researchers gathering for the biennial International Microbicides Conference in Pittsburgh next weekend express cautious optimism.

""Frankly, blocking transmission of the virus appears to be a lot harder than anyone understood it would be at the beginning,"" says meeting co-chair Dr. Sharon Hillier of the University of Pittsburgh and a principal investigator of the Microbicide Trials Network.

""The reason we're not depressed in the microbicide world? We actually have learned a lot and moved on to think about potent drugs and really cool delivery methods.""

Antiretroviral drugs have revolutionized AIDS care, helping people live far longer with the virus. They've also successfully lowered the risk that an infected pregnant woman passes HIV to her child. So it was logical for scientists to begin testing whether swallowing an antiretroviral drug every day could protect the still healthy, both men and women, from getting infected. More than half a dozen studies of this so-called pre-exposure prophylaxis are under way among high-risk populations around the world, largely using the drug tenofovir because it tends to cause fewer side effects than many other AIDS drugs.

Even if that eventually proves protective, taking daily pills has drawbacks — systemic side effects, the risk of drug resistance, what happens if people miss a dose or share tablets with an already infected relative — that make the approach controversial.

Hence the need for topical protection, too. Women already make up half of the more than 33 million people worldwide living with HIV, and most of the new infections in hardest-hit sub-Saharan Africa are among young women.

""I have in fact so little to offer them in terms of HIV prevention that I sort of tear my hair out,"" says Dr. Salim Abdool Karim of the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.

He led the pending tenofovir gel study, his ninth microbicide study since 1994. ""It must take a certain level of perseverance to want to stay in this field.""

In those years, scientists discovered that cells on the vaginal surface aren't big targets of HIV, yet the virus somehow fairly quickly penetrates to a much more susceptible second layer. Monkey studies show a small population of ""founder"" cells apparently reproduce in that spot for a few days before the virus is ready to spread, Hillier says. Drugs like tenofovir block HIV's replication in the already infected, suggesting they're a good try for that window period, she explains.

And tenofovir concentrates in vaginal tissue at far higher levels via a gel than a pill — with little spread of the drug elsewhere, easing side-effect concerns, adds Karim.

His study recruited 900 HIV-negative heterosexual women to test whether tenofovir gel, applied up to 12 hours before intercourse and again within 12 hours afterward, lowered the risk of infection.

While awaiting his results in July, the U.S. National Institutes of Health is funding the next step: Researchers now are recruiting up to 5,000 healthy women in several African countries to use either vaginal tenofovir gel — daily rather than timed around intercourse — or daily pills containing the drug. It's the first comparison of the two strategies.

Taking a lesson from contraception — that more choices equal more usage — researchers are developing other potential tenofovir methods, too: A quick-dissolve tenofovir vaginal film, with less mess to be completely invisible to the partner. Vaginal rings that could ooze tenofovir into the vagina over a month. And for gay men, a rectal tenofovir.

Health workers should be thinking now about the challenges should any of these attempts work, Dr. Regina Osih of the University of Witwatersrand will tell next week's microbicide meeting. Access is a big question in already overburdened regions — as is how often users would need HIV testing to be sure the protection's working.

NewsDay,OPINION: Closing Huntington Station hiring site is shortsighted,"Sandra Dunn is the immigration program officer of the Hagedorn Foundation.

The Huntington Town Board's sudden decision to close the Huntington Station Hiring Site comes as a shock to hundreds of day laborers, local employers, the site manager (the respected, 84-year-old Family Service League) and the two foundations that have partnered with the town for nearly two years to fund the site.

Thanks to support from the Long Island Community Foundation and the Hagedorn Foundation, the site was able to hire staff and acquire a trailer - turning an empty lot into a genuine employment service and allowing the town to scale back its funding. Regardless, town officials never bothered to inform its partners that it was considering shutting down the site.

Misinformation abounds. The town claims that the site attracts too few workers to be worthwhile, even though, according to the Family Service League, it attracts between 100 and 140 a day - 25 to 30 percent of Huntington Station's total day labor population. A sizable portion of the day labor population, in other words, finds work through this safe, staffed, well-regulated site, which permits no drugs or alcohol on the premises and provides five portable toilets.

The Family Service League enlisted the help of local institutions, including St. Hugh of Lincoln Roman Catholic Church and the Huntington Interfaith Homeless Initiative, so that the men could receive one hot meal a day from church volunteers and, in some cases, spend the night at HIHI. Treating these laborers humanely and with dignity benefits the entire community. Fewer people have gone hungry or have slept on the street or in the woods.

Site managers connected the day laborers with local English classes and offered them informational sessions on workplace issues, regular meetings with local police, quarterly HIV testing and citizenship services. These services and meetings stressed the importance of health and safety, and strengthened the connection between the day laborers and the community.

Closing the site will not help ease tensions or create a safer community. It will mean more men looking for work on the street, more men without toilet facilities, fewer men learning about citizenship requirements and taxpayer identification numbers, and, therefore, fewer on the path toward integration. The community and the town board appear to want to sweep day laborers out of Huntington Station, not understanding that the users of the site are Huntington Station residents. They have a constitutional right to gather in public places, as numerous court rulings around the country have established.

But closing the site allows the town to say ""we did something"" in response to the community's concerns about crime. Unfortunately these will be empty words, because the town is punishing the wrong population. Gang violence may be flourishing in some sections of Huntington Station, but not at the hiring site, where working men simply seek a day's pay for a day's work to sustain and improve life for their families.

Closing the site also sends a strong message to many in the Latino and immigrant communities - not just day laborers - that the town does not welcome them or value integration enough to provide them with information about citizenship and income tax payments, and does not care enough about their well-being and quality of life to continue offering the basic shelter that the trailer provides.

We cannot imagine what public good is served by closing this successful hiring site, which has cost the Town of Huntington less and less over the years. In fact, the Family Service League reports that now that the community knows the site will be closed, local residents are hiring laborers there in record numbers. We hope these same citizens will call on the town to reverse its shortsighted decision.",12/05/2010
NewsDay,"Publisher: George W. Bush book details his decisions, flaws","NEW YORK - The publisher of former President George W. Bush’s book “Decision Points” on Sunday set a Nov. 9 release date, unveiled its cover design and announced new details about it.

Bush has said he is not writing a traditional memoir but an account of key decisions in his life. The cover features a photo of then-President Bush alone with his thoughts, standing in the Rose Garden Colonnade, wearing a dark suit and holding a briefing book, his head turned slightly from the camera.

According to Crown Publishers, “Decision Points” will offer “gripping, never-before-heard detail” on such historic events as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the 2000 presidential election along with Bush’s decision to quit drinking, his relationship with his family and other personal details.

“Since leaving the Oval Office, President Bush has given virtually no interviews or public speeches about his presidency,” Crown said in a

statement. “Instead, he has spent almost every day writing ’Decision Points,’ a strikingly personal and candid account revealing how and why he made the defining decisions in his consequential presidency and personal life.”

A publishing industry source familiar with the book said that Bush had completed a first draft and was editing the manuscript on a computer at his office in Dallas. A former White House speech writer, Chris Michel, is helping with research. The source was unsure whether Bush had compared notes with his wife, Laura Bush, whose memoir comes out May 4.

The source asked not to be identified because the book had not been released.

As president, Bush was known for not acknowledging errors, but Crown said that he “writes honestly and directly about his flaws and mistakes, as well as his historic achievements in reforming education, providing life-saving treatments for HIV/AIDS and malaria for millions of people in Africa, safeguarding the country from another terrorist attack, and other areas.” The book will have a list price of $35. One thousand signed, clothbound copies will be available, priced at $350 each.

The former president will promote “Decision Points” through a national tour, although Crown, a division of Random House Inc., said no details were available.",25/04/2010

NewsDay,State suspends license of LI doc in kickback case,"The state health department suspended the license of an infectious disease doctor from Albertson after he pleaded guilty to paying his patients kickbacks to use his three pharmacies.

Last September, Dr. Muhammad Ejaz Ahmad, 52, who treated HIV-positive patients at his Brooklyn office, was sentenced in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District to 21 months in prison and three years supervised release. He was also ordered to pay $1.7 million in restitution.

He pleaded guilty to the scheme in May 2008 and is set to begin his sentence May 7, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

From January 2004 to August 2006, Ahmad offered HIV-positive patients on Medicaid a $40 kickback at every visit, even though he was reimbursed only $30 by the state, the government said.

He then referred these patients to one of three pharmacies he owned, two of which were in Queens and one in Brooklyn. The pharmacies then billed Medicaid $2.5 million for medications that were either black market medications, generics or were never dispensed, the U.S attorney's office said.

Ahmad could not be reached for comment. His license was suspended March 8 and announced Monday.

The pharmacies were also affiliated with his brother, Muhammad Nawaz Ahmad, and his brother-in-law, Mohammad Tanveer, both of Floral Park. Both also pleaded guilty.

State Health Commissioner Dr. Richard Daines used his emergency powers to summarily suspend Ahmad's medical license because his continued practice ""constitutes an imminent danger to the health of the people of New York,"" the health department said.",22/03/2010
NewsDay,Kidsday interviews Jason Derulo,"We met singer Jason DeRulo at his record offices in Manhattan recently. His song “Whatcha Say” is one of our favorites.

When did you write your first song and what was it?

My first song was written when I was 8 and it was called “Crush On You.” I had a crush on this girl in my class and I wanted to write a song about it. At this point I had been studying classical music and in classical music you can’t really sing the song how you want to sing it. You have to kind of stay within the guidelines and stay with what is just written on the paper. You can’t really embellish at all. And when I wrote this song I noticed I could write whatever I wanted to and sing it however I wanted to. So when I wrote that song I started writing every single day after that.



What would you say if kids had a good voice and didn’t know what to do with it?

I would say reach for the stars. When I say things like I want to impact the world with my music, and with my performance. You know people might be like who does this guy think he is. But it’s OK to reach for the stars. It's ok to have big dream because if you don’t believe in yourself then nobody will. I’m still reaching for the stars. I still want to go way beyond where I am right now. This is just the beginning. You should always set your goals as high as possible. If you believe it in your heart it’s really possible.



What was the best moment of your singing career?

I have to say when “Whatca Say” went No. 1 on the Billboard charts. It’s an incredible feat. Jay-Z just got his first number one with “Empire State of Mind.” And my first single went No. 1, and it’s just incredible. That was like the ultimate moment for me. Hearing my song on the radio was also awesome, but going number one kind of topped that.



Where did you grow up and where do you live now?

I grew up in Miami and now I live in LA. I kind of live in hotels all across the country. But other than that my home is in LA.



If you could have another career, what would it be and why?

It would definitely be an acting career. I’ve been studying acting for my entire life also and acting is an equal love of mine. So definitely acting. I’m actually in an upcoming film called “Turn the Beat Around” coming out this year.



Who helped you along the way of your career? Did your parents?

Sign up for Newsday's Family newsletter Things to do with kids, events, more. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

My parents played definitely a huge part in this whole process. They put me into performing arts schools; they were always really supportive. They let me do what I wanted to do. It’s not easy for a parent to allow their child to go this route because it’s kind of the impossible dream and to allow your child to chase something that’s not realistic in most people’s eyes is a feat in self.



Who are some celebrities you worked with?

Lil Wayne, Danity Kane, Cassie, P-Diddy, Sean Kingston, I co-wrote “Replay” for IYAZ, which is another big song we know, Birdman, Pitbull.



How was it when you first performed in concert?

Nerve wracking when I was backstage. I remember being backstage and saying I’m not going on, I'm not doing it, no, I changed my mind, I’m OK. And I was talking to this guy and I didn't even know who this guy was, he just picked me up and actually put me on the stage. And once the music came on and I started singing, I was OK.



Do you rehearse a lot?

I rehearse so much. I don’t think anyone rehearses as much as me. I have always rehearsed a lot. That's what I spend all my time doing. Dancing, singing, rehearsing, acting. Just all forms of performances just always been my thing. I didn’t even consider it rehearsing because I love doing it. So it was just doing what I love doing.



Do you see yourself as a role model?

I would hope so. I think I could actually be a cool role model. I would like for people to be more involved in charity as I am. I cut 14 inches of my hair to donate to Locks of Love for children with cancer and various diseases. I’m constantly giving to different charities. I would really like it if people got involved in, you know, do some of the stuff that I do. Especially celebrities because they have a voice and people are paying attention to them. It’s really unfortunate some of the things that are happening now, cancer and HIV and all these things. There needs to be awareness and there needs to be more giving. Giving back.



How did you start or get discovered like found or famous?

It was no big break for me. It was as journey for me. I started when I was 5 years old. I started singing and dancing and when I was 8 I started writing songs. I always wanted to be a performer but when I started writing songs it was really fun for me. I wanted to continue to write songs. When I was 16 I wrote a song for Birdman and from Birdman it just kind of snowballed and I just kind of started writing for all different kinds of artists in the industry. Lil’ Wayne, P-Diddy, Cassie, Danity Kane, Sean Kingston doing all this writing and that’s kind of how I got noticed. They were like wow this young guy is writing all these songs for all these different people. So a bunch of labels started to get at me and my manager and the rest is history.



Do you get scared when you’re on the stage singing and performing?

Before I get on stage I get a little nervous. My palms get a little sweaty, but once I get on the stage then I’m OK. Then everything is just like home. I feel like at one with my fans and the audience. Before I go on stage it’s like a little nerve-wracking.



What’s you favorite hobby when you’re not singing?

Playing basketball would probably be my favorite. I try not to play too much because I don’t want to get hurt at this point because I got to go on tour. I’m on tour with Lady Gaga. It’s one of the great things happening and I don’t want to get hurt. I try to work out other ways.



If you were able to sing with any star, who would it be?

Madonna. I would love to do a collaboration with Madonna. She’s ground breaking. She’s changed the world with her music and I would love to pick her brain and go into the mind of a legend.



Who was your role model?

My role model was Michael Jackson. He was my biggest influence and he's the reason why I started singing and started dancing. When I was 5 years old I had seen him for the first time and I was like Mom I want to be just like him. And ever since then I just followed this dream. I didn't want to do anything else. So if you ask me to change a tire, I would be like what?



Where is one special place you would want to perform?

Madison Square Garden.



Why did you write the song “Whatcha Say?”

It was inspired by my brother. He called me one day. He was like I cheated on my girl, I don’t know what to do, she left me. What should I do Jay. I'm like stupid go beg for her love back you messed up. So it's time for you to get on your knees and beg. If she takes you back lucky you. I just thought that was so compelling. It happens every single day and so many people go through infidelity and stuff like that. So I wrote a song about it and it just happened to be magical.



What was your favorite subject in school and where you good at it?

Lunch. I was really good at lunch. People just don’t -- they didn't appreciate lunch like I did. Lunch was always so good to me. Mexican pizza was awesome. I loved the beef patties, chicken, chicken patties. I loved the chicken patties for breakfast. Do you guys have those still? OMG, they’re amazing. Aren’t they? And I use to like to pop the jelly. Like pop it on there.



What is your favorite song?

My favorite song of all time is “Dirty Diana” by Michael Jackson.



If there was a news article written about you, what should be the headline?

Jason Derulo the King. No. Jason Derulo, philanthropists. Philanthropy is just giving back like you know what I was saying, like with charity and stuff like that. So I would like to be known as one of the biggest, who has ever been in this whole entertainment thing. It's really important to me and I think I get this trait from my mother. She's always fed the homeless, stuff like that. That's just how I was brought up. I always think about others before I think about myself. That would be my favorite headline.",19/03/2010
NewsDay,Olympic drug testing for Mayweather-Mosley fight,"There won't be any dispute about blood testing this time around.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Shane Mosley have agreed to use Olympic-style drug testing for their May 1 fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Much was made of the issue after Mayweather demanded that Manny Pacquiao agree to random blood testing. Pacquiao refused, which halted plans for their megafight.

Mosley, who has been lobbying for a chance at Mayweather or Pacquiao for several years, said he is more than willing to take random blood tests.

""If he wants to test, no problem, I'll take one. I would've agreed to it before and after 2003,"" Mosley said at a news conference earlier this month. ""I live my life clean.""

Representatives of the fighters joined Travis Tygart of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency Thursday to discuss the program in a conference call.

Mayweather (40-0, 25 KOs) has made references to Mosley's links to BALCO on several occasions. Mosley (46-5, 39 KOs), according to leaked grand jury testimony, admitted to unknowingly taking steroids in 2003. When asked at the news conference about Mosley's speed, Mayweather said: ""We know when he was on steroids, he was fast.""

Mayweather, who still believes Pacquiao is using performance-enhancing drugs, said he hopes that someday all states will require boxers to submit to random blood testing.

Blood testing is not required by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which uses only urine samples. But Keith Kizer, the executive director of Nevada's athletic commission, told Newsday earlier this month that the commission would welcome the results.

""If they are taking blood tests, I would want to see copies of those tests, along with their MRIs and HIV tests,"" Kizer said.

The USADA will oversee the tests, which can be administered before and / or after the fights.

Mayweather and Mosley met with officials from the anti-doping agency last weekend to provide whereabouts information and learn about the testing, which is similar to testing used in amateur sports.

It's not clear what the punishment would be if either fighter were to test positive for a performance-enhancing drug.

NewsDay,Mosley-Mayweather start throwing punches early,"Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather and WBA welterweight champion Sugar ""Shane"" Mosley kicked off their nationwide press tour Tuesday in grand fashion as the two briefly exchanged blows during a news conference at the Nokia Theatre Times Square.

Mayweather (40-0, 25 KOs) and Mosley (46-5, 39 KOs) will square off in a 12-round welterweight bout May 1 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Mayweather, who scored a unanimous decision over Juan Manuel Marquez in September, didn't waste any time reminding everyone of Mosley's BALCO connection.

""We know when he was on steroids, he was fast,"" Mayweather said when asked how he would deal with Mosley's speed. ""[Manny] Pacquiao's got those power pellets . . . I don't have to throw any names out there, but they're all cheaters.""

For all intents and purposes, Mosley was plan B for Mayweather, who was to take on Pacquiao. But when that fight fell through - Pacquiao will fight Joshua Clottey on March 13 in Dallas - Mosley became the next best option.

The Mayweather-Pacquiao bout collapsed after the two fighters couldn't come to an agreement on blood testing.

Mosley, who according to leaked grand jury testimony admitted to unknowingly taking steroids in 2003, had no problems with Mayweather's demands. ""If he wants to test, no problem, I'll take one. I would've agreed to it before and after 2003,"" Mosley said. ""I live my life clean.""

""Nevada will be administering only its standard fight-week urine tests. If they are taking blood tests, I would want to see copies of those tests, along with their MRIs and HIV tests.""

Mosley said there was no illusion as to why Mayweather took the fight. ""I believe he took this fight because it's the biggest fight out there,"" said Mosley, who stopped Antonio Margarito in nine rounds on Jan. 24, 2009. ""There's no other fight for him to fight and make money.""

NewsDay,"OPINION: Abstinence, sex-ed... What really prevents teen pregnancy?","Joseph A. Puccio, MD, FAAP, is chief of the Division of Adolescent Medicine at Stony Brook University Medical Center.

The United States has long had one of the highest rates of pregnancies, births and abortions among teenagers among the Western industrialized countries. And that's a problem with deep social and economic repurcussions.

In the 1990s, to combat these rates, sex-ed programs focused on increasing teen contraception use. They seemed to work; there was a 40 percent decline in teen pregnancies between 1990 and 2005. But after that, as was reported late last month, the rates saw an uptick.

Just as some critics were proclaiming that these new statistics show that abstinence programs don't work, however, another study was released, suggesting that an abstinence-only program successfully reduced sexual activity in inner-city teens.

Now what?

The most recent study, coming out of the University of Pennsylvania, reported that an abstinence program reduced the onset of sexual activity among middle school students when compared with students who attended a health information class or one focused on safer sex.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But the students studied were very young - with an average age of 12 - and the specific program did not conform to the ""abstinence until marriage"" curricula that have been popular over the past 10 years. In particular, the program did not focus on moral issues, and it also addressed contraceptives when they were brought up in class discussion.

The answer to why teen pregnancy is increasing is complex. Although the rise can't be attributed solely to increased spending on abstinence-only programs, it seems likely that the decreased emphasis on contraceptives among teens who are already sexually active contributed.

The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy reported that there is mounting evidence that between 2005 and 2007, older teens were having sex and not using contraception of any sort. This could be partly explained by decreasing concern about AIDS among teens. In contrast to the early 1990s - when teens were educated about HIV and the need for consistent contraceptive use - HIV education to high school students has decreased more than 15 percent since 1997.

But some of the rise in pregnancy rates among older teens may also indicate that high school students aren't receiving age-appropriate education. The University of Pennsylvania study appears to show that abstinence programs can be effective for 12-year-olds, but what about as kids mature? Too few pregnancy-prevention programs focus on older teens' social situations and relationships.

Ironically, the modest success of the pregnancy-prevention message over the past decade may also be contributing to the recent increases. After some success was achieved, the spotlight placed by parents, educators, politicians and health care practitioners became less intense - and funds for government programs and from private foundations were devoted to other initiatives. This resource shift has been compounded by recent budget cuts in these difficult economic times.

So how do we approach the problem of teen pregnancy now? These seemingly contradictory studies suggest that a reasonable approach would be to provide comprehensive sex education that focuses on abstinence as the only sure means of preventing sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, complimented by age-appropriate information regarding contraception to prevent unwanted consequences for those teens who choose to become sexually active.

One thing is certain: We owe it to our teenagers to keep fine-tuning our approach.",18/02/2010
NewsDay,Ads on LIRR target African-American homophobia,"In between ads for TV shows and clothes on the Long Island Rail Road is a different kind of message. These ads feature pictures of young African-American men with their families, at church and on the basketball court. At the top of each poster are the words, ""I am gay.""

The Bay Shore-based Long Island GLBT Services Network sponsored the ads with a $37,000 grant from the state health department. David Kilmnick, chief executive of the group, said he hopes the ads will start a conversation within black communities about homosexuality and homophobia. ""This is the first time there's this visible of a campaign and so widespread across the entire Island,"" he said. ""It's in your face in a positive way. . . . It's talking about, 'We're gay and this is our home and this is our community.' ""

Dale Anthony Edmonston, an African-American AIDS activist from Hempstead, said homophobia in the black community has had disastrous results for gay black Long Islanders. ""In the African-American community, it's taboo to talk about gays and lesbians,"" he said. ""Many members of the African-American community have family members who are gay and lesbian.""

African-Americans have the highest rates of HIV and AIDS among any racial group on Long Island: 809.4 out of every 100,000 blacks on Long Island are infected with the virus, compared with 317.1 out of every 100,000 Hispanics and 94.9 out of every 100,000 whites, said the state department of health.

In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that black men who have sex with men account for the largest number of new cases of HIV and AIDS among blacks nationally.

""HIV/AIDS continues to be a major health concern for all New Yorkers, but especially gay African-American men,"" said Jeffrey Hammond, a spokesman for the health department. ""The campaign will help to reduce the stigmas that often create barriers for African-American gay men to seek testing and treatment.""

The ads began this month at nine LIRR stations, on trains and buses, and across a trestle in West Babylon. The MTA, which operates the LIRR, said it has received two complaints from people offended by the message.

The Rev. Reginald Tuggle of Memorial Presbyterian Church in Roosevelt said he thinks the new campaign is misguided.

""There's no movement to single out homosexuals"" in the black community, Tuggle said. Gays are not a topic of discussion in many black churches, he said - especially since other issues are more relevant.

""People who are gay come in all races,"" Tuggle said. ""And homophobia exists in every community. To say that only black people don't like black people who are gay, that's silly. That's reprehensible.""

Christopher Gabriel, 42, a gay black man from Roosevelt, said he thinks the ads are a good first step, but more needs to be done. ""I don't know if the ad campaign is big enough to make a dent,"" said Gabriel. ""We're going to need several ad campaigns . . . to get to the point when we can even have a dialogue.""

NewsDay,Revisiting a hate crime in 'The Laramie Project',"More than a decade has passed since Matthew Shepard, a diminutive, 21-year-old University of Wyoming student, was crucified for being gay. Shortly after that hate crime was committed, the New York-based Tectonic Theatre Project began its series of interviews with residents of Laramie, Wyo., about their thoughts, experiences and firsthand accounts of that horrible night and its trying aftermath.

Written by Moisés Kaufman, ""The Laramie Project"" premiered in 2000. Last fall, on the 11th anniversary of Shepard's death, the company debuted its sobering follow-up, ""The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later,"" simultaneously at theaters across the country.

Having seen both productions at Port Jefferson's Theatre Three, I thought it would be enlightening to revisit the original ""Laramie Project."" Ably directed by Michael Disher for Southampton's Center Stage, the docudramatic play continues for two more performances. If you've never seen ""The Laramie Project"" or its sequel - but perhaps especially if you have - this opportunity should not be missed.

Despite the recitative nature of this postmortem testimonial, ""Project"" retains its harrowing juxtaposition of humanity and inhumanity.

We're moved as Vay David, self-described best bartender in town, frets about her police officer daughter, displaying a stoic sense of duty as played by Allison-Rose DeTemple, who was exposed to Shepard's HIV-positive blood at the crime scene. We wonder what causes a supposed minister (played by James Macaluso) to proclaim, ""Fags die, God laughs."" Never mind what causes two Shepard contemporaries - Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were also 21 - to beat him savagely and leave him to die lashed to a buck fence. Daniel and James Yaiullo make achingly callow murderers.

What have we learned? Perhaps, sadly, not much. In the follow-up ""Project,"" most Laramie residents say they've ""moved on,"" and many have recast the crime as a robbery gone bad.

The cradle of the motion-picture industry in the early 20th century before studios relocated to sunny Southern California, New York boasts some of the finest movie theaters in the country - and no U.S. metropolis could compete with the sheer number of first-run and repertory films unspooling at any given time.

Strolling the city's streets, you'll frequently find yourself walking past a movie set or encountering an iconic location from one of cinema's golden treasures. As James Sanders explains in his excellent book ""Celluloid Skyline: New York and the Movies,"" ""A great city is more than a geographic or economic entity: it is a distinct locus of image and style, memory and dreams."" Or, as three singing sailors once famously put it: New York, New York - it's a helluva town.

NewsDay,Obama's whirlwind tour of Ghana,"ACCRA, Ghana - Protocol says you stand when the presidentwalks into a room. But for a handful of pregnant women, PresidentBarack Obama was willing to make an exception.

Obama and first lady Michelle Obama highlighted prenatal healthduring a program Saturday at a La General Hospital in Ghana. Whenthe first couple joined the group, many of the visibly pregnantwomen stood.

""Maybe all the mothers can sit down,"" Obama said.

Obama told a few reporters on hand for the visit that suchprenatal counseling is important to reduce infant mortality rates.Ghana declared infant mortality an emergency last year.

As the Obamas departed, Mrs. Obama grabbed the hand of a nursewho was guiding them through the halls.

------

One concern of no-drama Obama during the visit seemed to bekeeping the excitement to a minimum.

""Nobody's going to have a baby right now, right?"" he calledout as he walked up to the group of about 20 expectant women.

Obama, in shirt sleeves, and first lady Michelle Obama visitedthe hospital before his address to parliament.

The hospital focuses on prenatal care, HIV testing for pregnantwomen, improved labor and delivery services, afterbirth care andnutritional counseling, and gets assistance from the U.S. Agencyfor International Development.

------

The Obamas toured several areas of the clinic, meeting moremothers and babies as they went.

""This is the highlight of the trip. Look at these cuties,""Obama said of the babies. He hoisted a couple of the children andleaned over cribs, and down, to greet the others. One seemedfrightened and began to cry.

""What's the matter?"" he asked.

Mrs. Obama then took the child in her arms. That calmed the babyfor a bit -- before she fled to her mother.

But Obama wasn't taking any responsibility for frightening thechild.

""I think it's the reporters who are scary,"" he joked about themedia contingent that follows his every public move. ""They scareme all the time.""

--------

For a politician, Obama seemed to be striking out with thebabies.

On a subsequent part of the hospital tour, he lifted up anotheryoung one -- who also was crying.

""She wants to make a speech -- to parliament,"" the presidentjoked.

------

As Obama's motorcade passed cheering crowds after leaving thehospital en route to the convention center for his speech, onewoman held up a sign conveying one thought about what thepresident's surname stands for:

O nly

B black

A merican

M anaging

A merica

------

Obama is used to getting standing ovations. Not so familiar: ablasting trombone.

As he took the podium for a speech to Ghana's Parliament,someone in the rear of the convention hall bleated out raw tones.Obama took a few moments to take it all in.

""I like this,"" Obama said, noting his reception by U.S.lawmakers doesn't come close. ""I think Congress needs one of thosehorns.""

------

In the audience were two of Ghana's most recent presidents, JohnKufuor and Jerry Rawlings.

Obama noted their presence at the top of his remarks, along withJoyce Adeline Bamford-Addo, the speaker of parliament, who gave alengthy, praise-filled introduction of her distinguished Americanguest.

""We have in our midst this morning the historic presence of thepresident of the United States,"" she said.

She called Obama an ""illustrious personality"" whose campaignmantra of ""Yes We Can"" has echoed far beyond the borders of theUnited States and has helped shake the ""slumber and despair out ofmany people around the world.""

------

The Obamas' reputation as high-fashion influences are welldocumented. In Ghana, they're even shaping casualwear.

Along streets in the country's capital, well-wishers sportedclothing with the Obamas' likenesses. Students wore T-shirtsstamped with Obama's image, vendors sold knit hats with Obama andhis wife on them, and street merchants sold posters of the family.

American flags stamped with Obama's face also were peddled.

------

After the speech, Obama flew by helicopter to the coast for afamily tour of Cape Coast Castle, a seaside fortress converted tothe slave trade by the British in the 17th century.

Marine One, as any chopper with Obama aboard is called, landedon a muddy soccer field.

How muddy?

Another of the helicopters accompanying the presidential partysank to its belly as the wheels went into the mud. It lifted outand landed again. But so rough was the original landing that aideMarvin Nicholson banged and bloodied his head. He said he'd getstitched up on the return flight to Washington aboard Air ForceOne.

There was even more helicopter difficulty as the presidentialentourage prepared to leave. Staff had to get off one chopper andboard another. It was unclear why.",11/07/2009

NewsDay,Proposal would remove ban on HIV foreigners' entry,"The federal government moved one step closer to officially ending its long-standing ban on HIV-positive individuals visiting or moving to the United States, a move hailed by gay rights and AIDS advocates Monday.

The Department of Health and Human Services will issue proposed regulations this week that would remove HIV from the list of ""communicable diseases of public health significance"" that prevent foreign nationals from entering the country.

""This is the penultimate step,"" said Rachel B. Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality in Washington, D.C. ""These regulations are a long time coming. There hasn't been a major HIV scientific conference in the U.S. in decades because of this ban.""

A 45-day comment period begins this week before a final review and implementation of the new regulations.

David Kilmnick of Long Island Gay and Lesbian Youth said, ""It's about time we become a little more forward-thinking on those living with HIV.""

Last year President George W. Bush signed into a law a bill that removed a statutory ban on foreign visitors and immigrants infected with HIV. But advocates were worried the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would not remove HIV from its list of ""communicable diseases of public health significance"" that affect immigration policy. HIV was added to the list - which includes tuberculosis, leprosy and gonorrhea - in 1987.

Aaron Glatt, president of New Island Hospital and a spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America, said HIV is clearly not as contagious as tuberculosis. ""A person who doesn't engage in risky behavior is not going to be at risk,"" said Glatt. But he said though the policy makes sense from a compassion point of view, it could lead to financial burdens if patients come to this country for care. ""One needs to make sure that the communities that are going to be serving these patients aren't adversely affected from an economic point of view,"" he said.

The United States is one of about a dozen countries with such bans, including Saudi Arabia and Sudan, said Allison Herwitt of Human Rights Campaign in Washington. China reversed its ban before the 2008 Olympics.

Short-term visitors to the United States are asked if they have a communicable disease of public health significance. Those who want to become legal permanent residents by applying for a green card are subject to a medical exam.

The only way around the ban is to apply for a waiver. ""It's almost impossible now for people to be able to get a waiver,"" said Karen Ross of the Long Island Association for AIDS Care. ""People coming here for business trips are forced to disclose their status"" for a waiver, she added.

Catherine Hart, executive vice president of the group, said the rule will help remove ""the stigma and the discrimination that's associated with the disease.""",29/06/2009
NewsDay,Where to play paintball on Long Island,"Whether your game is Capture the Flag or elimination, woodsball or speedball, spring's the season to cover up in protective gear, crouch behind the nearest obstacle and splatter your buddies with paintballs.

Paintball has become a phenomenon with about 5 million players nationwide, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association - including thousands of Long Islanders, local venues say.

""Soon as the weather breaks, it's like a switch goes off,"" says Dean Del Prete, owner of Cousins Paintball in Coram, which operates five fields nationwide.

Recognized as an extreme sport, paintball combines the fun of a childhood game of hide-and-seek with ""the thrill of the hunt and the fear of getting shot,"" Del Prete says.

Rob Arnold of High Velocity Paintball in Coram and Bay Shore says paintball offers an adrenaline rush and lets working folks get ""frustrations out on the weekend.""

NEW THIS YEAR

Among spring improvements, High Velocity has added new bunkers to its park, which also features a popular castle scenario and 40 army trucks and tanks on war-themed fields.

The Island's third facility, the indoor Paintball Arena in West Babylon, is sporting a new Plexiglas viewing area so parents and other spectators can watch the action from a splat-free zone. They've also switched from color to white paint to facilitate cleaning, says owner John Pennino.

NewsDay,2 drug makers combine HIV businesses into new company,"LONDON - Drug makers GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Pfizer Inc. said Thursday they plan to create a new company to invest in the research and development of HIV treatments.

The deal allows the two companies to merge their strengths in the HIV drugs business — Glaxo is a big seller of HIV treatments but its products are relatively old and its pipeline of future drugs is also relatively weak. Pfizer, on the other hand, has a significant store of drugs in development but few products on the market.

London-based Glaxo will initially hold an 85 percent equity interest in the new company, with New York-based Pfizer holding the remaining 15 percent.

The two companies said that the new business ""will be more sustainable and broader in scope than either company's individually,"" adding that it will hold a 19 percent share of the growing market.

The new company will have a broad product portfolio of 11 marketed products including market-leading therapies such as Combivir, Kivexa and Selzentry/Celsentri. Based on 2008 results, the combined portfolio generates sales of around 1.6 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).

The companies said revenues at that level will provide the new company with financial stability and support investment in its pipeline.

""By combining Pfizer's and GlaxoSmithKline's complementary strengths and capabilities, we are creating a new global leader in HIV and reaffirming our ongoing commitment to the treatment of the disease,"" said Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler in a joint statement issued to the London Stock Exchange.

""With the strength of the companies' current HIV products, as well as the complementary fit of Pfizer's HIV pipeline and GSK's global distribution capabilities, the new company is well positioned to bring new and improved medicines to patients with more speed and efficiency,"" Kindler added.

The company will have a pipeline of 6 innovative and targeted medicines, including 4 compounds in phase II development. Altogether, the new company will have 17 molecules at its disposal to develop in fixed-dose combinations as possible new HIV treatments.

The new company will contract research and development services directly from Glaxo and Pfizer to develop new medicines.",16/04/2009
NewsDay,'Pedro' on MTV and Logo,"“Pedro,” which premieres tonight on MTV (and simultaneously on sister station Logo), dramatizes the short, productive life of Pedro Zamora, a third-season cast member of ""The Real World"" -- the 1994 San Francisco season, known also for the abrasive, abusive and generally uncooperative bike messenger Puck, who was kicked out of the house, in part because of his treatment of Zamora.

This was back when ""The Real World"" still had the air of a social experiment, making roommates of seven strangers ""to find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real,"" before it became, for a while anyway, a kind of financed spring break, a chance to live in a cool house and party and be on television.

Born in Cuba and raised mostly in Miami, Zamora -- ""the first-ever openly gay, HIV-positive main character on TV,"" the network says -- was an inspirational figure just for showing up. But he was also an AIDS educator who saw his ""Real World"" tenure as a kind of platform -- in a time when Ellen DeGeneres was still in the closet and gay characters, let alone HIV-positive gay characters, had yet to become unremarkable participants in the narratives of mainstream television. Yet ""The Real World"" made the ring exchange between Zamora and boyfriend Sean Sasser the centerpiece of one of its episodes and made the enlightenment of his cast mates one of the series' main themes as well. It was bold television in its time, and the gesture still resonates.

Although it is the vessel of such worthy burdens, the film itself -- even with a screenplay by Oscar-winning ""Milk"" scribe Dustin Lance Black -- is just all right, typical of its generally disappointing kind, a mix of re-creation and speculation that on the whole is far less compelling than life. The drama proceeds in expository snippets and confrontational scenes, some reenacted from ""Real World,"" and hits all the bullet points. But there is little in it as powerful as the documentary footage clipped on to the end.

Much of what does work involves Justina Machado as Pedro's sister, Mily; she creates a whole person where most of the actors suggest characters. Whether that person is anything like Mily is, dramatically speaking, beside the point; when Machado is on screen the film (directed by Nick Oceano) becomes immediately more real. As Pedro, Alex Loynaz is less convincing -- quite winning at times but at others too clearly acting a part.

Like ""The Real World,"" ""Pedro"" comes from Bunim-Murray Productions, and some of the film's more interesting moments involve not Zamora but the mechanics of reality TV -- that while Pedro was known to everyone but his family as Peter, for example, the producers asked that he go by Pedro. It also gives a picture of the military maneuvering that goes into filming such a series. (And in a cyclical bit of self-referencing, or cross-promotion, the cast of the current ""The Real World: Brooklyn"" was recently shown watching a screening of ""Pedro."")

Despite its faults, many will doubtless be moved, because films like this have to meet us only halfway: They get by on what we bring to the table -- our memories of the events they portray or the time they recall, and of people we've known in similar circumstances. But with all of ""The Real World: San Francisco"" available on the MTV website, you are better off watching the thing itself, which is sweeter and more affecting and more complex than this refracted abstract.

NewsDay,Man with HIV charged with mailing blood to Obama,"An Ethiopian refugee from Chicago's North Side is in federal custody for allegedly mailing an envelope containing his own HIV-infected blood to then-President-elect Barack Obama, authorities said today.

Saad Hussein, 27, of the Edgewater area, faces two counts of sending ""nonmailable articles"" containing HIV-infected blood, according to a criminal complaint.

Two similar envelopes were sent with Hussein's name on them, including one to then-U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.), who now serves as Obama's chief of staff, according to federal court records. Hussein has denied sending the letters, the records stated.

The envelope to Obama was the second time the U.S. Postal Inspection Service has investigated a mailing containing HIV-infected blood, but the ""two were isolated incidents,"" said Postal Inspector Pete Rendina. He said the previous case occurred in 2006 and did not involve a high-profile person.

On Dec. 29, a letter postmarked for Dec. 27 and addressed to Obama was received by an office in the Illinois Department of Revenue building in Springfield, according to federal documents, and was found to contain unknown substances. The letter, which contained Hussein's return address, prompted a hazardous materials response to the building, which was also put on lockdown for almost two hours.

That same day, Chicago police went to Hussein's residence on the North Side. After taking Hussein and his brother into custody, they were interviewed by FBI and U.S. Secret Service agents.

During the interview, in which his brother served as his interpreter, Hussein said ""he had mailed the letter to [Barack] Obama, and he had placed inside the envelope a powder substance, his [HIV positive] blood, a photograph of himself taken in Bali, Ethiopia, an admission ticket to the election night celebration in Grant Park and other articles,"" according to court records.

Hussein confirmed to the agents that the photos they obtained from the envelope were the same ones he mailed, the records show.

Although Hussein claimed to be an admirer of Obama's and tried to obtain tickets to his Jan. 20 inauguration, he said he ""purposely cut one of his fingers with a razor so he could bleed on the letter,"" the records show. They also show Hussein stated he has HIV-positive and ""it was his way of seeking help from the government.""

The records state the envelope contained a letter written in Ethiopian, but there were no references in the letter that Hussein requested tickets to the inauguration.

On New Year's Eve, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service was notified by Illinois Department of Revenue officials about two more envelopes almost identical to Hussein's. One of the envelopes was addressed to Emanuel and the other was addressed to the Illinois Department on Aging.

""These [envelopes] were found to contain an orange powder substance, what appeared to be dried blood and writings similar to the mailing of December 27, 2008,"" court records show. During the interview, according to the records, Hussein denied mailing any additional letters.

In early January, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported that all the letters tested negative for biological agents.

Sharon Paul, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Springfield, said Hussein, who was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago, was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation after his arrest. MCC officials have to submit a report on his evaluation to the U.S. District Court in Springfield by Mar. 29, she said.",27/02/2009
NewsDay,Four LI teens named Intel finalists,"For parents wondering what to tell their kids about teenage drinking, high school scientist Chelsea Jurman has an answer: What you don't say may be even more important.

Jurman, a Roslyn High School senior who spent a year examining how parental behavior and teens' perception of it predicts underage drinking, was one of four Long Island students to be named finalists Wednesday in the national Intel science contest.

Her findings might come as a surprise to some parents, who believe being honest with their children about their own high school drinking is the best way to promote responsible attitudes toward alcohol. Turns out, teens who think their parents drank when they were underage are more likely to do it themselves.

The project involved analyzing data from 125 student surveys distributed to upperclassmen at Roslyn High.

""I wanted to find out why are some people starting to drink while some people are still saying no,"" said Jurman, 17, who is also editor of the school newspaper. ""What I've taken away from what I found is that parents might not want to discuss their past behaviors with their kids.""

In all, New York State had nine finalists - the most of any state. They included four from New York City (two each from prestigious Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science) and one from Westchester County.

In addition to Jurman, two students from Ward Melville High School in East Setauket and one from Smithtown High School West were named finalists. Last year, Long Island had nine Intel finalists.

The finalists will receive at least $5,000 each in scholarships and a new laptop. They will compete in March in Washington, D.C., for a $100,000 scholarship from Intel.

Both finalists from Ward Melville tackled cancer research in their projects. Senior Preya Shah, 17, of Setauket, created a new synthetic drug that targets cancer cells while leaving healthy ones unharmed.

""The novel drug has exciting potential to treat drug-resistant cancer without causing significant side effects,"" said Shah, who says her mother, a doctor, and her father, an engineer, stoked her interest in science.

""My parents have been encouraging,"" she said.

For Shah's classmate, Christine Shrock, 17, science is also a family affair. Both her parents are scientists, and her project was inspired by her aunt and grandfather's battles with cancer. Her research targeted structural changes at the molecular level of a protein called MDM2, to help design better cancer drugs. She was a regional finalist last school year in the Siemens Competition in Math, Science and Technology for a project on HIV with her younger sister, Ellen.

Shah was a Siemens regional finalist this year.

Patrick Abejar, 17, a senior at Smithtown West, focused his project on global warming patterns. He measured the level of boron in marine fossils, and found that those levels fluctuate with global warming and cooling. The higher levels indicate a global warming cycle, lower levels a global cooling period.

""The pattern is cyclical and we can use this model to predict what will occur next,"" Abejar said. Even so, the teenage scientist was unable to predict his own success in the contest.

During a conversation with his father Tuesday night, on the eve of the finalists' announcement, Abejar warned his family not to get their hopes up. ""I was, like, 'It's really tough and they only pick 40, so don't expect that much,' "" Abejar said. ""Just, like, literally 30 minutes later, they called to tell me I was a finalist.""

NewsDay,Obama transition team eyes Bill Clinton's dealings,"The all-but-public process of vetting Hillary Rodham Clinton as a potential secretary of state is, by all evidence, now focusing on how to keep her husband's sprawling global network of charitable and private activities from becoming an ethical or national security problem.

Since he left office in 2000, former President Bill Clinton's presidential library and foundation and his philanthropic Clinton Global Initiative have grown into a multibillion-dollar web of relationships extending through some of the world's richest and poorest countries - not all of them democratic.

Sen. Clinton has engaged three prominent lawyers to help President-elect Barack Obama vet her candidacy, The Associated Press reported last night, even as some insiders criticized the pick and advisers to the former first lady said she was weighing whether to take the job if Obama offered it.

""He [Obama] is trying to figure out how to handle Bill, and quite frankly she's trying to figure out how to handle Bill,"" said a source familiar with the confirmation process. ""You can't have foreign dictators financing the pet projects of a husband of a secretary of state.""

Attorneys Cheryl Mills, David Kendall and Robert Barnett are working with the Obama transition team to review information about the Clintons' background and finances. All three represented the Clintons on legal matters in the White House, including Bill Clinton's dalliance with intern Monica Lewinsky that led to his impeachment in 1998.

Officials knowledgeable about the vetting said it has gone smoothly and that both Clintons were cooperating fully. Bill Clinton already has suggested he would step away from day-to-day responsibility for his charitable foundation while his wife served and would alert the State Department to his speaking schedule and any new sources of income, they said.

Since he left office, former President George H.W. Bush has made millions of dollars from speeches and kept up ties with the Saudi royal family. Jimmy Carter has monitored elections in multiple countries and met with Hamas.

But Bill Clinton is in a class by himself, experts in nonprofit conflicts of interest say.

""The size of Clinton's operation is a factor that dwarfs the other folks,"" said Pablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute. ""It's both a national security and a diplomatic issue. ... Clinton has got to agree up front should Hillary be named that he will disclose his donors.""

Manhattan attorney William Josephson, former counsel to the Peace Corps and head of the state attorney general's Charities Bureau, said he believes the former president will have to step away for now from the philanthropy he has built. "" ... I would think that he would need to stop raising money from foreign sources - at a minimum,"" Josephson said. ""... People give money for many reasons, and one is to exercise influence. ... If he believes the work that's being done is valued and should continue, then it should be carried on by someone else.""

Eisenberg and others also point to Bill Clinton's 2005 trip to Kazakhstan with Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra, who received preferential access to state-controlled uranium after Clinton gave a speech extolling reforms planned by the president of a country his own wife had sharply criticized for its human rights record. Giustra later made a $31.3-million donation to Clinton's foundation, The New York Times reported.

Paul Light, professor of public service at New York University, said he believes Bill Clinton's reputation for undisciplined remarks could be a particular problem.

""Because they are husband and wife ... it's natural to assume that he may be speaking for the administration at any point in time ..."" Light said. ""The world will say, well, is there an extra meaning to what the former president is saying?""

GLOBAL NETWORK

Hillary Rodham Clinton's chance of becoming U.S. secretary of State could hinge on the vetting of her husband's worldwide dealings. Since leaving the White House in 2001, Bill Clinton has engaged in his own international diplomacy with a foundation, speeches and investments. Here's a snapshot of his known global reach:

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

FOUNDATION

He has raised more than $500 million for the foundation, which runs his charitable activities and presidential library. He refuses to make donor names public.

CLINTON GLOBAL

INITIATIVE

A loose coalition and annual meeting hosted by the foundation, this is his entree to world leaders. He encourages, but doesn't run, projects to help underdeveloped countries. Since 2005, the initiative says it has spawned 1,200 projects in 150 countries valued at $46 billion.

CLINTON HIV/AIDS

INITIATIVE

The foundation's top program works with drug firms and governments to lower AIDS drug prices in the Caribbean, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. In 2006 and 2007, it reported spending about $110 million.

CLINTON HUNTER

DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

Begun in 2005, this project with the Hunter Foundation, run by a Scottish sporting goods magnate and investor Tom Hunter, has pledged to spend $100 million in a decade in

Rwanda and Malawi.

CLINTON GIUSTRA SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INITIATIVE

With projects in Colombia and Peru, this initiative began in 2007 with a pledge of $100 million from Canadian mining tycoon Frank Giustra. It started after the two went to Kazakhstan, where Clinton announced lower-priced AIDS drugs and Giustra won two mining deals.

SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS

Most of Clinton's income is from speaking fees that totaled nearly $52 million by the end of last year; $32 million of that was for talks in 42 foreign countries.

PRIVATE INVESTMENTS

Clinton has made at least

$12 million in a partnership with investor Ron Burkle, whose deals have included investing money for Dubai's government and a stake in a Chinese media firm. - Tom Brune",18/11/2008
NewsDay,Black pastors speak out on Wright's statements,"The Rev. Sedgwick Easley of the Union Baptist Church in Hempstead was sitting in the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on Monday when the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. spoke and generated worldwide headlines.

From Easley's perspective, Barack Obama's longtime pastor was generally right on target, and the storm of criticism aimed at him is an attack on the black church in general as Wright contended. ""I think the issues that he spoke about are issues America does not want to hear about,"" Easley said.

In his appearance Monday, Wright insisted that the firestorm of controversy surrounding him ""is not an attack on Jeremiah Wright; it is an attack on the black church.""

While his assertion received support yesterday from some black Long Island ministers and national academics, others disagreed. Many agreed that black churches in America are largely misunderstood by the media and white America.

The Rev. Charles Coverdale of the First Baptist Church in Riverhead said he did not believe the controversy surrounding Wright constituted an attack on black churches in general. He also said he did not necessarily agree with all of Wright's statements on Monday, such as the suggestion that the U.S. government may have invented HIV/AIDS to wipe out minority communities.

Still, Coverdale said, decades ago the U.S. government gave out blankets infected with smallpox to Indians. ""What makes that so far out for him to reach that way?"" Coverdale said. ""Our governments have done some things that as a country we ought not to be proud of.""

He added: ""I love my country. Within that love there have been some dastardly deeds.""

Others said there is a lack of understanding of the black religious experience.

The Rev. Reginald Tuggle of Memorial Presbyterian Church in Roosevelt, who said he was sitting about 20 feet from Wright on Monday, said that ""when preachers speak out, they're often criticized by the media because they represent a voice that cannot speak for itself.""

He added that ""systemic racism is alive and well"" in the United States and that the ""rebuke he's [Wright] gotten in the press may suggest an attack on the black church.""

Jonathan L. Walton, a professor of African-American Religion at University of California, Riverside, said Wright's actions at the press club may have been a perfect example of the disconnect between the media and black churches.

""There is a performative element to black preaching ... wherein the preacher is not only thoughtful and prepared, but also comedic,"" Walton said. ""I think based upon the large number of clergy that was present ... Rev. Wright began to feed off of the crowd in such a way that would be totally appropriate within the context of his church, but came across as very inappropriate at the National Press Club.""

William Green, a professor of religious studies at Tougaloo College in Jackson, Miss., said Wright spoke for many African-Americans, saying the controversy over his remarks represented ""a failure to put human value on anything that black people do.""

""It is an attack on the black church,"" said Green, who is black. ""My society is very critical of white society and angry about it. The vast majority of black people feel the way he does. They just probably wouldn't say it in white company because it's not advantageous.""",30/04/2008
NewsDay,New Yorkers somber after Bhutto assassination,"The perpetually buzzing hive of Jackson Heights, Queens took on a somber pall Thursday as residents in the heart of the city's Pakistani community reacted with grim resignation to the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

At Mansour Bookshop on Broadway, owner Abbas Zaidi, pulled Bhutto's book, ""Whither Pakistan: Dictatorship or Democracy?"" from a window display.

""It's not surprising,"" he said. ""The government can't provide security. She was everyone's leader. Her background was very international. She was very educated. There is no one else.""

As he spoke, an Urdu newspaper was delivered with the headline, ""Benazir Bhutto Killed in Suicide Attack"" splashed across the front.

""I don't agree with the ideology of Benazir but this should not have happened,"" said Shulam Syed, 63, as he eyed the paper.

Many in Pakistan, he said, will likely blame America. ""The people there are uneducated, if they hear a rumor they think it is the truth. If their goat doesn't give milk thy think it's due to the U.S.""

In Jackson Heights, Indians, Bangladeshis, and Pakistanis alike crowded around televisions in restaurants, grocery stores and barber shops to listen to the news.

At Punjab Barber Shop on 37th Road, only the snips of clippers competed with a live address by Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf.

""This is the work of those terrorists with whom we are engaged in war,"" the president said. ""We will not rest until we eliminate these terrorists and root them out.""

""They are going to postpone the elections. [Musharraf and Bhutto] were going to work together. Now there is no one. He is not a good president. They are all corrupt. You have to choose the least corrupt one,"" Zaidi said.

Rahman Sipra, 42, could only shake his head. ""She was a good leader, a good president. I was crying when I heard the news.""

Meanwhile, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city was stepping up security at the Pakistani consulate on East 65th Street and at other places where Pakistanis gather.

Police officers had been briefed on Bhutto's assassination, he said. ""And they're going to do everything they can to keep Pakistani New Yorkers and all New Yorkers safe.""",27/12/2007

NewsDay,Koch: An unfair and unnecessary smear,"Former Mayor Ed Koch wrote a weekly column for New York Newsday from 1999-2000. This column first appeared in December 2000.

ON DEC. 12, 1999, The New York Times Magazine published an article by Andrew Sullivan appropriately entitled ""Not a Straight Story."" That very day was my 75th birthday. In the article, Sullivan names half a dozen public figures about whose sexual orientation he speculates. I was one of them.

The next day a reporter asked my reaction. I said: ""There are two kinds of outers - one, the homophobic heterosexual; and the other, the self-hating homosexual. Both are no different from the Jew-catcher of Nazi Germany. Having reached the age of 75 years, I am flattered by any interest in my sexuality.

But, I am truly offended by the assaults on the privacy of the women (Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Attorney General Janet Reno) referred to in the article. They have done nothing to deserve his venom."" Sullivan, a former editor of The New Republic, responded: ""There was certainly no venom. I don't believe in outing people, but people should be as open about their homosexuality as they are about their heterosexuality."" When queried, a spokeswoman for The New York Times said: ""(Sullivan) is not invading anyone's privacy."" Really?

Sullivan wrote: ""In Clinton's cabinet, almost everyone is married or divorced, but for two who aren't, Donna Shalala and Janet Reno, their orientations are shrouded in deep ambiguity."" This is not an attempt at outing? What did he mean by describing them as ""shrouded in deep ambiguity"" because they've never been ""married or divorced""? Sullivan, self-identified as a homosexual who has HIV, is surely aware that Oscar Wilde was not only married but had two children when his relationship with Lord Alfred (Bosie) Douglas was made public.

If Shalala and Reno were or had been married, they apparently would have satisfied the Sullivan litmus test of sexual orientation. What an outrage.

Sullivan went on to say that: ""At a time when the stigma against homosexuality is far weaker than even 10 years ago, a gay person doesn't need to lie to maintain social standing ..."" Sullivan's conveniently ignoring the murders of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming and Pvt. Barry Winchell at Fort Campbell, Ky., both killed because they were homosexuals, is mind-boggling.

Now as to me. Over a period of 25 years, I ran for five different elective positions. In almost every one of them, my opponents' campaigns attacked my sexuality because of my single status. The most notorious example of this occurred during the mayoral race of 1977 when posters were hung up and down Queens Boulevard which read: ""Vote for Cuomo, not the Homo."" We never knew who it was. The smear campaign continued through Election Day.

I believe an individual's sexual orientation is a private matter. I have declined to discuss mine because it is no one's business. If someone denounces homosexuality and is himself a homosexual, then revealing that hypocrisy is reasonable. That happened in Congress in the case of former Republican Rep.

Robert Baumann of Maryland.

I have never denounced homosexuality or heterosexuality. In 1962, I ran for the New York State Assembly urging the repeal of the sodomy laws. In 1974, I was one of two New York members of Congress, the other being the late Bella Abzug, who sponsored a national gay rights bill. At that time, only three other members of Congress supported this bill.

In 1978, in one of my first acts as mayor of the City of New York, I issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination in government based on sexual orientation. In 1986, I signed a local law, whose passage I had urged for many years, that prohibited discrimination in the private sector based on sexual orientation.

I recently wrote my 12th book, ""I'm Not Done Yet,"" in which I say: ""I'm well aware of the occasional speculation, but it doesn't matter to me whether people think I'm straight or gay ... Life is gentler and more comforting when you have someone to share it with. In my case it wasn't meant to be, although it is only lately that I find myself reflecting on it. I honestly didn't think about it much when I was younger, but I do now."" To Sullivan, I say: I'm not vulnerable to your venom.

To The New York Times, I say: On this occasion you failed to live up to the motto established by your creator Adolph S. Ochs-""All the News That's Fit to Print."" To both, I say: You owe two fine public servants, Donna Shalala and Janet Reno, an apology.

NewsDay,A friendship fractured by AIDS,"THE PRINCIPALS in this tale wish to keep their names out of the public eye for fear of further damage to their child's emotional well-being. The perpetrators - if they are that - would claim, if they were not denying every accusation, that they were protecting their child's physical well-being. Ancillary characters range from righteous bureaucrats to ignorant humans.

There is no proving either side of the story; no evidence exists save testimony in dispute. I happen to believe the one side, but I have only my instinct to offer as weight.

All the names have been changed by me.

Ann and Gene, who grew up in Babylon Town, in Suffolk County, now live in Nassau County. Last year they sent their then-3-year-old son, Patrick, to a private nursery school in a community adjacent to their own. They learned of the nursery school through Ann's friend and neighbor, Elizabeth, whose mother works at the nursery school. Elizabeth's son, Carl, regularly plays with Patrick.

Last year, Elizabeth's mother helped Ann register Patrick at the school and offered Ann invaluable advice about its personnel. The two boys would have been in the same nursery school class last year, but Patrick, who has a speech impediment, was seeing a therapist in the mornings, so his mother enrolled him in the school's afternoon session. Carl attended school in the mornings. Ann had hoped that beginning last month, Patrick would attend the morning session with Carl.

In February, just after the beginning of Patrick's second semester at the nursery school, Ann and Gene received the disturbing news that Gene's brother, Robert, who had been living near Washington, D. C., had tested positive for the HIV virus. No warnings or warning signs heralded the shocking news. Robert suddenly was in the intensive-care unit of a hospital. He had contracted a virulent strain of pneumonia common to AIDS patients and was diagnosed as having AIDS.

Ann and Gene had to fly to the Washington / Maryland area to visit Robert. Ann told Elizabeth where they were going and why. ""Nobody down there believes that Robert is going to live,"" Ann said to her close friend, whose next question haunted Ann for weeks and puzzled her. ""Then why are you going?"" Elizabeth had asked.

Miraculously, Robert survived the pneumonia, but he was too weak to work or otherwise to support himself. So, with the help of his family, Robert moved back to Long Island, to live with his parents in Babylon.

Worried about Robert's mental and emotional well-being as well as his physical health, and struggling with the prototypical, child-care dilemma common to working parents of young children, Ann and Gene asked Robert if he would babysit for them. They needed him particularly during weekday mornings, when Gene was working and Ann, a night-shift nurse, most required uninterrupted rest. Robert was happy to take the job.

Having confided in Elizabeth when Robert first was diagnosed, Ann now asked Elizabeth - more or less as a pro forma courtesy - if she and her husband would mind if the boys continued to play together every day, as they had done all year.

""That marked the beginning of the end of our relationship,"" Ann recalled. Ann said that Elizabeth said she would check first with her pediatrician. The pediatrician then told Elizabeth, she phoned Ann to say, that if other children were to play with Patrick, they would be putting themselves at risk of contracting the AIDS virus.

""The fact that my son didn't have AIDS seemed to have nothing at all to do with it,"" Ann said.

To Ann's further surprise, Elizabeth, who did not like the idea of Robert's babysitting in the first place, now said she was no longer sure that the boys should play together in the afternoons. Ann then said she would fire her husband's brother as a babysitter to accommodate Elizabeth's trepidations regarding Robert's having the AIDS virus.

Elizabeth said, ""Well, you're still going to see him, right?""

""See him?"" asked Ann. ""Of course we're going to see him. He's Gene's brother.""

""Obviously,"" Elizabeth said, ""I couldn't ask you to not do that.""

""In other words,"" ventured Ann, ""you're ending our friendship.""

""Well, I couldn't ask you to not do that.""

Ann said, ""Goodbye"" and hung up the phone.

""These were friends, people we went away on vacation with,"" she said angrily.

Next, Ann received a call from the director of the nursery school, who said she would like to meet with Ann and Gene. Ann said, ""I'm sure I know what this is about, and there's nothing to discuss.""

The director insisted, and they met. The director suggested strongly that Ann and Gene were irresponsible as parents to allow contact between Patrick and his uncle. They were putting their child at risk to contract AIDS. Ann and Gene were appalled and said so. In a subsequent conversation, the director suggested that "" . . . it would be best if we found another school for our son,"" Ann said.

Ann called a lawyer. The lawyer wrote a strongly worded letter warning the director against discrimination. The director called the lawyer and said that of course Patrick could attend school. No one ever had said he could not. No one ever had said a word about a family member's HIV status.

It later turned out, after several guarded exchanges, that there simply was no room available for Patrick in the morning session. He could attend the afternoon session, as he had the year before. Ann and Gene felt they had gotten the message. They found another nursery school for Patrick.",06/10/1991
