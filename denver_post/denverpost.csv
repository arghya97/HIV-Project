The Denver Post,Trump administration fires all members of HIV/AIDS advisory council,"The remaining members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS were fired en masse this week.

Months after a half-dozen members resigned in protest of the Trump administration’s position on health policies, the White House dismissed the rest through a form letter.

The notice “thanked me for my past service and said that my appointment was terminated, effective immediately,” said Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University who works on HIV testing programs. He was appointed to a four-year term in May 2016.

The council, known by the acronym PACHA, has advised the White House on HIV/AIDS policies since its founding in 1995. Members, who are not paid, offer recommendations on the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, a five-year plan responding to the epidemic.

The group is designed to include “doctors, members of industry, members of the community and, very importantly, people living with HIV,” said Scott Schoettes, an attorney with the LGBT rights organization Lambda Legal. “Without it, you lose the community voice in policymaking.”

Schoettes was among those who quit in June, and he went out with a fiery commentary in Newsweek. “The Trump Administration has no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and – most concerning – pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease,” he wrote in the column.

“We tried to stick it out,” Schoettes told The Washington Post on Friday. “The fact is you’re dealing with a public health issue. It’s not partisan at all.”

But the “writing was on the wall,” he continued. The Office of National AIDS Policy, established in 1993 during the Clinton administration, has not had a director since President Donald Trump took office. “The tipping point for me was the president’s approach to the Affordable Care Act,” Schoettes said. “It is of great importance for people living with HIV like myself.”

The council’s executive director, Kaye Hayes, confirmed in a statement that all remaining council members had received letters Wednesday “informing them that the administration was terminating their appointments.”

She did not address when the administration might begin to make new appointments to the council, which can number up to 25 members. Its most recent meeting took place in August, Sullivan said, and by November, an archived version of PACHA’s website shows the group was down to 10 members and two staff.

The website, which says it was updated Dec. 28, now shows two staff and no council members.

“Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during administration changes,” Hayes said in the statement. “The Obama administration dismissed the George W. Bush administration appointees to PACHA in order to bring in new voices. All PACHA members are eligible to apply to serve on the new council that will be convened in 2018.”

The Washington Blade reported that termination letters were delivered without warning by way of FedEx. Gabriel Maldonado, chief executive of the LGBT and HIV/AIDS group Truevolution and a council member until this week, said he could only speculate why the final members were fired.

“Like any administration, they want their own people there,” Maldonado, an Obama appointee, told the Blade.

But Sullivan and Schoettes said that previous administrations had allowed members to serve full terms before appointing replacements. “It is important to have a rolling, transitioning body that crosses administrations that really has a set of diverse outlooks on the epidemic,” Sullivan said.

In September, Trump issued an executive order that continued PACHA and 31 other advisory bodies through fall 2019. A call for new council member nominations went out via a Dec. 1 notice posted on the federal register. The nomination period closes on Tuesday.

Sullivan said he hoped that new members will “continue to engage around the issues that the previous PACHA brought up.” Schoettes is not optimistic that the notice will attract qualified people.

“The only criteria for serving this president is loyalty,” he said. “From the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], to this body, to the FBI, there is a real problem this president has with dialogue or dissent.”

The Denver Post,Places to go for free HIV testing on Friday in honor of World AIDS Day,"Friday is World AIDS Day, so no better time for people to find out their HIV status.

Between 1982 and 2010, roughly 16,600 people were diagnosed with HIV in Colorado, according to Denver Public Health. In recent years, about 430 new diagnoses have been made annually.

The only way to know if someone has HIV is to be tested. Roughly 20 to 25 percent of people living with HIV are unaware, according to Denver Public Health. That percentage jumps to 51 percent among people between the ages of 13 to 24.

There are ways for a person living with HIV to prevent the spread, including a daily medication and proper condom use.

Here are places where you can get free HIV testing on Friday:

The Denver Post,Trump’s firing of HIV/AIDS council should send a clear signal,"Re: “Trump administration fires all members of HIV/AIDS advisory council,” Dec. 29 news story.

Donald Trump’s dismissal of remaining members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, which has been charged with advising the administration’s policymaking since 1995, should send a clear signal to his base of his utter lack of interest not only in this disease, but many other key social and economic issues affecting us all.

The message to his base is this: Candidate Trump and President Trump are two different animals. We are left with an administration having no strategy, approach or desire for improving our day-to-day lives. When you wake up tomorrow to read his next tweets, think long and hard about the long-term implications to what he is saying. Then ask yourself: Is this what I voted for?

The Denver Post,"In struggle against HIV, scientists get help from cows","SAN DIEGO — Prospects for defeating HIV, once considered an invincible killer, look brighter with major advances against the AIDS-causing virus discussed at an international conference this week.

One of those pieces of good news comes from The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla. In collaboration with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, its researchers have generated “broadly neutralizing antibodies” that kill HIV using an unexpected source — cows.

The startling feat was announced in a study published in the journal Nature. It marks another milestone step toward the long-elusive aim of creating a vaccine against the virus, with the antibodies perhaps also leading to creation of new HIV drugs.

“It takes humans years” for the immune system to trigger formation and full production of broadly neutralizing antibodies. “The cows solved it in a couple of months,” said Dennis Burton, co-author of the new report and a longtime researcher of such antibodies at Scripps Research.

In other news at the 9th IAS Conference on HIV Science in Paris, researchers highlighted the case of an HIV-infected child who has apparently been cured of the virus. They also announced success in using a long-lasting injection to suppress HIV levels.

Yet another study showed that certain HIV drugs were able to prevent transmission of the virus in hundreds of couples where at least one person was HIV-positive.

Despite the progress, HIV continues to spread and destroy lives, said Mark Feinberg, the vaccine initiative’s president and CEO.

“To me, the most significant thing is how the epidemic continues to ravage many countries and communities, and is still such a major threat to so many people’s lives,” Feinberg said. “While this disease may have receded from the headlines, it hasn’t gone away. And unless things are really stepped up, it’s going to get worse rather than better. That is part of the discussion taking place in Paris.”

In the United States, 1.2 million people are living with HIV. The worldwide number is 37 million, with many of the patients living in poor countries with inadequate health care. Mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, people can’t get ready access to the drugs that have turned HIV from a virtual death sentence when it was discovered in the 1980s into today’s manageable disease.

And a lack of awareness of how the virus is transmitted means more are infected all the time. About 2.1 million new infections occurred worldwide in 2015, according to the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Over the course of the HIV-AIDS epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, according to the World Health Organization. About 35 million of them have died of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome

During this time, numerous efforts have been launched to develop a vaccine against HIV. But none of those projects has demonstrated more than a modest benefit in reducing the rate of infection.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies have long been researched intensively for clues on making a better HIV vaccine. It’s hard for the human immune system to produce these antibodies because HIV mutates prolifically, presenting a moving target. When these antibodies finally arrive, the virus is too well-established to eradicate from the patient’s body, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

But if the immune system could be trained with a vaccine to make these powerful antibodies before any infection occurs, the virus might be blocked from getting a foothold, Fauci said.

In the study from Scripps Research and the vaccine initiative, calves were injected with HIV fragments selected to provoke production of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Their quick response was remarkable, said Burton and study co-author Vaughn Smider, a Scripps Research colleague. It’s thought that the bovine immune system’s powers protect it from extensive exposure to microbes in its gut as it chews and rechews its cud.

This power may be conferred by a peculiarity of cows’ antibody structure.

Antibodies form a Y shape. At the ends of the two arms are loops of protein that latch onto the molecular target, called an antigen. These loops are called complementarity-determining regions, or CDRs. Their structure determines which antigens it can bind to.

An antibody region called CDR H3 is far longer in cows than in humans, which provides a greater reach to find the right molecular latching point, such as in a deep indentation that hides a vulnerable region. A broadly neutralizing human HIV antibody has an exceptionally long CDR H3 region, but is still much shorter than the one in cows.

Insights from how cows make these antibodies could help in several ways.

First, they could give guidance in devising an effective HIV vaccine that can quickly rev up the immune system to make these powerful antibodies, blocking HIV from getting a foot in the door, said Fauci, Burton and Smider.

In addition, the broadly neutralizing antibodies could be manufactured as HIV drugs to prevent or treat infection, they said. The antibodies would need to be altered to look more human so they don’t provoke an immune reaction, but this has been done with other antibody drugs.

Finally, the study could provide a template for developing vaccines and therapies for other diseases, such as influenza.

While HIV and the flu virus are quite different, the general concept is the same. The most prominent targets on each mutate rapidly. Other parts, vital to the virus function, remain relatively constant but are concealed. The immune system must produce antibodies to the unchanging areas and not be distracted by areas of rapid change.

“A lot of the tools developed for HIV are now being applied to flu,” said Feinberg with the vaccine initiative. A vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, may be even closer at hand, he said.

“RSV has been a pathogen which causes serious morbidity and mortality in young children and older people,” Feinberg said. “And it’s long been at the top of many lists for vaccine development, but for a variety of reasons has been challenging.

“I’m hopeful that these new approaches will actually crack the code on that and enable the development of an efficacious RSV vaccine. … So it is a direct example where the work in HIV is having broad benefits to other areas as well,” he added.

At Scripps Research, Burton and colleagues have been examining broadly neutralizing antibodies for decades, seeking evidence of a potential vaccine ingredient. The goal is to compress the years of “educating” the human immune system into months, through a series of vaccinations using fragments of HIV along with other substances to stimulate an immune response.

Complementary research carried out at the nearby La Jolla Institute for Allergy & Immunology has shown that certain other immune cells, called helper T cells, are made more abundantly by people whose bodies also generate broadly neutralizing antibodies. So a vaccine should ideally help stimulate production of both types of cells.

The broadly neutralizing antibodies were discovered in HIV-infected people over the years, at first one by one, then in increasing numbers as research expanded. In 2008, Scripps Research, working with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, established the HIV Neutralizing Antibody Center on the Scripps La Jolla campus to collaborate on studying these antibodies.

Another part of this research is figuring out why the human immune system is so bad at fighting HIV, compared to other viruses, Fauci said. The cow antibody research is useful as a conceptual tool.

“If we can figure out the way that (HIV) protein interacts with the cow’s immune system that allows the cow to make such great antibodies against HIV, and to do it so readily and quickly and in abundance, it may give us some insight into how we can develop an HIV vaccine in a human,” Fauci said.",26/07/2017
The Denver Post,Congress revamps housing program to benefit areas where HIV is spreading,"In a bipartisan push, Congress has restructured a federal program that provides housing assistance for people living with HIV to funnel more money into areas struggling to control the outbreak.

While legislators and housing advocates say the adjustments will better target regions with high rates of the virus, these changes are likely to mean less money for some of the large cities that confronted the early effects of the epidemic.

To help with the transition, Congress increased funding for the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program about 6 percent this year. In the past, this money was distributed across the country based on a jurisdiction’s cumulative number of cases (including people who had died).

Now under the 2017 funding, finalized by Congress in May, HOPWA has awarded $320.4 million to qualifying states and local jurisdictions to be apportioned primarily based on their share of the total number of people living with the virus. The number of cases required to qualify for funding also changed from 1,500 cumulative AIDS cases to 2,000 living cases of HIV/AIDS.

No jurisdiction will receive less HOPWA money than in 2016, but about 25 cities and counties are getting a smaller piece of the pie than before. The top five seeing their percentage of funding drop are, in order, New York City, Atlanta, Miami, Washington, D.C., and Houston.

“As the formula is fully implemented, without additional funds those jurisdictions will lose out,” said Opal Jones, vice president of the National AIDS Housing Coalition, a housing advocacy group in favor of the formula change. “It’s a great start. It’s just not enough.”

The program, which began in 1992, provides financial assistance to help participants pay for rent, mortgage and utility costs. HOPWA also offers competitive grants to jurisdictions and organizations, but that allotment accounts for only about 10 percent of its budget and is not included in the $320.4 million.

Shelter represents one of the most important factors in determining an individual’s success in HIV treatment. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers the HOPWA program, housing instability is linked to delayed testing and gaps in care. The department estimates roughly half of the individuals living with HIV in the U.S. will experience a housing crisis in their lifetime.

“I think we can’t underestimate the power that home has in improving the health in somebody with a chronic condition,” said Russell Bennett, executive director of the National AIDS Housing Coalition.

Shyronn Jones, 39, has struggled financially since she was diagnosed with HIV. She was once a homeowner in New York, but when she moved to Atlanta several years ago, the only housing she could afford was an apartment in a crime-ridden pocket of the city. She was having trouble getting medical care, her white blood cell count dipped to dangerously low levels, and her mental health deteriorated.

But then, a housing assistance organization connected Jones to HOPWA, which helped her to move into a better neighborhood with a nearby grocery store, post office and park, where her daughter can play.

“I had a lot riding on HOPWA,” she said. “HOPWA just saved me.”

Seeking to soften the impact of the formula change, the law increased appropriations this year so that each jurisdiction would see at least a small rise in funding. Over time, areas with higher rates of HIV transmission, such as the South, will continue seeing increases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 44 percent of all individuals living with HIV in the country reside in the South, even though only 37 percent of the U.S. population live in the region.

The extra $20 million allocation nationwide this year translated to double-digit percentage increases for more than 100 out of the 140 participating jurisdictions. Smaller cities such as Greenville, S.C., and Syracuse, N.Y., saw their funding jump by nearly 14 percent. Notably, some larger metropolitan hubs such as Portland, Ore., and Chicago also saw similar growth in their grants.

But efforts to funnel money into current HIV epicenters without additional funding could mean cuts for large metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and New York. To mitigate potential losses, the program’s statute stipulates that over the next five years, a grantee cannot lose more than 5 percent or gain more than 10 percent of its share of the previous year’s total HOPWA formula funds.

“We’ll see some losses in funding (for some areas) over the years,” said Rita Flegel, director of the Office of HIV/AIDS Housing. “And then money will be distributed more evenly among people living with HIV.”

Rep. David Price, D-N.C., who was one of the co-sponsors of the bill that reformulated the funding, said the phase-in coupled with the boost in funding helped assuage fears of cutbacks among lawmakers from areas with a legacy of large numbers of HIV cases.

“People of all sorts of political persuasions supported this because this was a question of fairness,” he said. Yet, “it was very clear that we needed to increase the size of the pie to make this proposition less difficult.”

One of the cities that could lose out is the nation’s capital. Nearly 13,000 residents, or nearly 2 percent of the population, live with HIV in Washington, D.C., according to the city’s health department.

HOPWA has not been able to keep up with demand of the area’s residents and the city discontinued its waiting list last year with more than 1,200 individuals, according to Michael Kharfen, the senior deputy director of the city’s HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and TB Administration. The area is expected to receive $11.2 million, a 1 percent increase from last year’s funding.

But the nation’s capital is not unique in its struggle to keep up with the demand. According to the latest data from HUD, 138,427 HIV-affected households across the country were in need of housing assistance.

Jones, of Atlanta, now resides in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in a neighborhood she dreamed of while growing up in New York City.

Her white blood cell count has doubled since her move, she said, and her mental state has improved. Jones, who is a policy fellow for the HIV advocacy organization Positive Women’s Network USA and runs a business that advises HIV patients on resources, is grateful to HOPWA for the assistance. But she said she hopes to become self-sufficient and help others dealing with situations similar to those she once faced.

“That’s what I’m striving for,” she said.",10/08/2017
The Denver Post,Everything you need to know ahead of Friday’s free HIV testing at a Lakewood clinic,"In honor of World AIDS Day on Friday, Jefferson County Public Health is offering free HIV testing at a clinic in Lakewood.

In 2015, more than 13,000 people in Colorado and more than 650 people in Jefferson County were living with HIV and AIDS, according to the latest data from the Jefferson County health department. Across the United States, more than 1.1 million people are living with HIV and AIDS.

But the number of new HIV infections each year has started to decline as advances in HIV prevention and care continue.

Denver Public Health said roughly 20 to 25 percent of people living with HIV are unaware. The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested, according to the health department. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone between 13 and 64 years old gets tested.

Despite the stigma, people living with HIV and their partners can have healthy, long lives. In September 2017, the CDC announced that people living with HIV have effectively no risk of spreading the virus if they adhere to their medicine and maintain an undetectable viral load.

Additionally, people can take Truvada for “pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, once a day, which helps prevent HIV. Another prevention technique is correct condom use.

Blaine Wajdowicz, a public health nurse with JeffCo, gave the rundown on everything you need to know if you’re interested in the free testing Friday:

Where? The health department’s Lakewood clinic at 645 Parfet St.

When? 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

Do I have to make an appointment? You can either walk in or call 303-239-7078 to set up an appointment.

How long will it take? Check-in typically takes 10-15 minutes. The appointment itself lasts for about 30 minutes.

What exactly happens? You’ll head in with a public health nurse for a one-on-one appointment. The nurse will prick your finger and take a small sample of blood. While the test is running, the nurse will discuss with you potential risk factors and help you develop a personalized risk reduction plan.

What to bring? All you need is a copy of your I.D.",29/11/2017
The Denver Post,"“People who have HIV are going to suffer,” says Denver professor who left presidential HIV/AIDS council in protest of Trump","A Denver professor who along with five others last week quit the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS in protest of Donald Trump said people with the virus “are going to suffer” under his policies.

“I made the decision to leave because I thought that making this kind of statement might make a bigger impact than staying on,” said Dr. Lucy Bradley-Springer, who is retired from teaching at the University of Colorado Denver. “It was not an easy decision to make.”

Bradley-Springer was appointed to the council — created by President Bill Clinton in 1995 to improve policymaking — about two years ago by Barack Obama and says she was asked to stay on when the Trump Administration came into office.

She said there were troubling signals almost immediately from the new White House about how the administration viewed the council.

“We sent a letter to the secretary of health, which is how the council talks to the administration, and we didn’t immediately hear back,” she said. “When we did hear back, it was from someone on a rather low level.”

Up to 25 people can be on the council, but only 21 were serving on the advisory group before the six resignations came last week.

The resignations were announced in a Newsweek column penned by member Scott Schoettes, who served on the council since 2014, and signed by Bradley-Springer and the four others who resigned.

“The Trump administration has no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and – most concerning – pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease,” Schoettes wrote.

The White House has rejected some of the claims made by the six who resigned, including that they did not make concerted efforts to meet with the council.

Bradley-Springer said she first started to doubt her position on the board just after Trump’s election because of his rhetoric during the 2016 campaign. The language Trump was using, she said, threatened to force people with HIV and AIDS into hiding, which could discourage them from seeking treatment and hurt efforts to stop the virus’ spread.

The former nurse and editor of the Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care said she was, and continues to be, concerned with Trump’s statements that seem to ignore evidence-based science.

“That may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back — knowing that we weren’t working from evidence,” Bradley-Springer said. “We were working from hearsay or what somebody thought sounded good. A lot of this is my personal feelings, but you have to remember, with HIV, that any stigma and discrimination creates a situation where people go into hiding. We were making inroads, and I think that the rhetoric that has come out of the administration has pushed people back into closets.”

Bradley-Springer said, too, that the U.S. House-passed American Health Care Act, which proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, threatens to eliminate funding for the roughly 40 percent of HIV/AIDS patients who get treatment under the program.

“I do feel like people who have HIV are going to suffer,” she said. “They are going to suffer if the advances we made in health care go away.”

The Denver Post,Suit: Aetna violated law with envelope revealing HIV status,"PHILADELPHIA — A Pennsylvania man is suing health insurer Aetna, saying his sister learned he was taking HIV medication after the company mailed him an envelope with a large, clear window that showed information on where to purchase the drugs.

The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia is seeking class-action status.

It says the 52-year-old man from suburban Philadelphia doesn’t have the virus that causes AIDS but was taking the medication preventatively.

The lawsuit claims the mailing violated the law by revealing HIV information of about 12,000 customers in at least 23 states.

A spokesman for the Hartford, Connecticut-based company declined to comment on the suit.

Last week, the company said it was reviewing processes to ensure such a mistake never happens again.

The Denver Post,"For 1st time, over half of people with HIV taking AIDS drugs","LONDON — For the first time in the global AIDS epidemic that has spanned four decades and killed 35 million people, more than half of all those infected with HIV are on drugs to treat the virus, the United Nations said in a report released Thursday.

AIDS deaths are also now close to half of what they were in 2005, according to the U.N. AIDS agency, although those figures are based on estimates and not actual counts from countries.

Experts applauded the progress, but questioned if the billions spent in the past two decades should have brought more impressive results. The U.N. report was released in Paris where an AIDS meeting begins this weekend.

“When you think about the money that’s been spent on AIDS, it could have been better,” said Sophie Harman, a senior lecturer in global health politics at Queen Mary University in London.

She said more resources might have gone to strengthening health systems in poor countries.

“The real test will come in five to 10 years once the funding goes down,” Harman said, warning that some countries might not be able to sustain the U.N.-funded AIDS programs on their own.

The Trump administration has proposed a 31 percent cut in contributions to the U.N. starting in October.

According to the report , about 19.5 million people with HIV were taking AIDS drugs in 2016, compared to 17.1 million the previous year.

UNAIDS also said there were about 36.7 million people with HIV in 2016, up slightly from 36.1 million the year before.

In the report’s introduction, Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS’ executive director, said more and more countries are starting treatment as early as possible, in line with scientific findings that the approach keeps people healthy and helps prevent new infections. Studies show that people whose virus is under control are far less likely to pass it on to an uninfected sex partner.

“Our quest to end AIDS has only just begun,” he wrote.

The report notes that about three-quarters of pregnant women with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, now have access to medicines to prevent them from passing it to their babies. It also said five hard-hit African countries now provide lifelong AIDS drugs to 95 percent of pregnant and breast-feeding women with the virus.

“For more than 35 years, the world has grappled with an AIDS epidemic that has claimed an estimated 35 million lives,” the report said. “Today, the United Nations General Assembly has a shared vision to consign AIDS to the history books.”

The death toll from AIDS has dropped dramatically in recent years as the wide availability of affordable, life-saving drugs has made the illness a manageable disease. But Harman said that “Ending AIDS” — the report’s title — was unrealistic.

“I can see why they do it, because it’s bold and no one would ever disagree with the idea of ending AIDS, but I think we should be pragmatic,” she said. “I don’t think we will ever eliminate AIDS, so it’s possible this will give people the wrong idea.”",20/07/2017
The Denver Post,Analysis: Trump wants you to know he actually does care about HIV/AIDS,"The White House has issued an earnest statement attributed to President Donald Trump about HIV/AIDS in America. It is technically accurate, apolitical and strikes just the right notes in terms of being somber and optimistic at the same time.

There’s nothing exciting about the content of the four-paragraph statement. It simply reminds people that Tuesday is National HIV Testing Day, reviews some statistics about the epidemic, and tells people why it’s important to get tested.

But coming on the heels of the resignation of six members of his Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) last week, the words took on more significance. An HIV/AIDS council member who resigned wrote that Trump “simply does not care.”

Some commentators, on Twitter and elsewhere, took the new statement as an attempt at extending a sort of olive branch to those affected by the virus that has devastated far too many communities since it was first identified 35 years ago.

“Today, on National HIV Testing Day, we encourage people to take the first step – discovery – in fighting the Human Immunodeficiency Virus,” the president’s statement said. He continued, “Greater awareness through testing is crucial in defeating HIV and AIDS. Thankfully, because of progress in testing and treatment, we have never been closer to conquering the epidemic.”

In the nearly eight months since he was elected president, Trump has managed to alienate a diverse range of stakeholders in the health-care world – from scientists researching autism to parents of children with pre-existing conditions. But the backlash from the HIV/AIDS community has been especially fierce.

In a very public display of frustration, Scott Schoettes, a former member of PACHA, accused the Trump administration of having “no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic.” Writing in a commentary in Newsweek, he also said Trump and his government have sought zero input from experts on their HIV policy and have pushed legislation that “will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease.”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer last week defended Trump against the accusations, but instead of being combative as he has been on other issues, he seemed to be trying to make nice with critics.

“Well, I mean, respectfully, the president cares tremendously about that and the impact it has,” Spicer said at a briefing. “Obviously, the individuals that he’s appointed here in the White House have been in communication with various stakeholders in that community to help develop policies and formulas going forward, but we’re going to continue to do what we can from a government standpoint.”

On Tuesday, Schoettes said in an email to The Washington Post that he’s glad the president spoke about HIV

“[T]his is the first such statement out of this White House, despite numerous opportunities to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the past 6 months – but what we really need is action on the health care bill,” he said.

Saying he has “little faith” that the Trump administration is “going to make a genuine attempt to address the needs of people living with HIV,” he said that he is appealing directly to senators working on the bill to sit down with HIV advocates to understand the consequences of their bill.

Schoettes called on Republicans to restore coverage mandates, Medicaid expansion and continue funding the important sexual health and prevention services provided by Planned Parenthood.",27/06/2017
The Denver Post,"Denver hospital surgery patients warned of potential risk of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C","An infection-control breach involving surgical instruments at Porter Adventist Hospital may have put some surgery patients at risk for contracting hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV, hospital and state health officials said Wednesday.

The breach may have affected patients who had orthopedic or spine surgery between July 21, 2016, and Feb. 20. The risk of getting HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C is “very low,” said Larry Wolk, the executive director and chief medical officer for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The hospital did not immediately respond when asked how many patients could have been impacted. Wolk directed the inquiry back to Porter.

“The process for cleaning surgical instruments following orthopedic and spine surgeries was found to be inadequate, which may have compromised the sterilization of the instruments,” read a statement from Wolk. The department doesn’t know of any patient infections related to the breach, he said. The hospital mailed letters to patients who may have been at risk.

The health department, which was told of the breach Feb. 21, conducted an on-site survey of infection-control practices at Porter the next day. A disease-control investigation is ongoing.

Patients notified by the hospital are receiving a list of frequently asked questions.

The letter explains that the sterilization issue revolved around the first step in a multistep process. The first step is a pre-cleaning process that happens before instruments go through “an intense heat sterilization,” the letter said.

“Although extremely low, there is a risk of surgical site infection or bloodborne pathogen transmission,” the letter read. “In the rare event that a patient tests positive for a bloodborne pathogen, there are many treatment options available. Your health care provider will discuss these with you in the unlikely event you receive a positive test result.”

The letter explains that a surgical site infection tends to present itself within 30 days of surgery, but in a very limited number of cases, symptoms might occur up to a year later if the surgery involved placement of a prosthetic limb.

Symptoms of an infection include pus, pain, tenderness or redness at the site of the surgical wound, the letter said. Patients being tested will be seen by independent laboratory LabCorp, which will need to draw several vials of blood. Results will be procured in 14 to 30 days.

Patients can call a hotline, 303-778-5694,.for more information.

As of March 28, the infection-control practices at Porter met standards. The hospital has since stopped using all surgical equipment in question from that time period.

“Patient safety is our top priority at Porter Adventist Hospital,” read a statement from Porter spokeswoman Chrissy Nicholson. “We are proactively working with the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment about a gap in the pre-cleaning process, prior to sterilization. While we take any gap in our pre-cleaning process seriously, at this time we are not aware of it having caused any infections. We are reaching out to patients who underwent orthopedic and spine surgery during the time in question. We remain committed to transparency; additional details will be forthcoming.”

In 2016, nine University of Colorado Hospital patients developed infections. Three of the patients later died. They had undergone operations with a duodenoscope, a hard-to-clean surgical device inserted into a patient’s throat.

Another 2016 state Health Department investigation found that workers at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs failed for years to properly disinfect vaginal ultrasound probes and other pieces of medical and surgical equipment.

Memorial Hospital officials said they found no evidence of infections caused by the hospital’s failure to properly disinfect medical tools.",04/04/2018
The Denver Post,"Trump “simply does not care” about HIV/AIDS, say 6 experts who just quit his advisory council","The first hints of an uncertain future for the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS came last year, when Donald Trump’s presidential campaign refused to meet with advocates for people living with HIV, said Scott Schoettes, a member of the council since 2014.

That unease was magnified on Inauguration Day in January, when an official White House website for the Office of National AIDS Policy vanished, Schoettes said.

“I started to think, was it going to be useful or wise or would it be possible to work with this administration?” Schoettes told The Washington Post. “Still, I made a decision to stick it out and see what we could do.”

Less than six months later, Schoettes said those initial reservations had given way to full-blown frustration over a lack of dialogue with or caring from Trump administration officials about issues relating to HIV or AIDS.

Last Tuesday, he and five others announced they were quitting Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, also known as PACHA. According to Schoettes, the last straw – or “more like a two-by-four than a straw” – had come in May, after the Republican-dominated House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act, which he said would have “devastating” effects on those living with HIV.

“The Trump Administration has no strategy to address the on-going HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and – most concerning – pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease,” Schoettes wrote in a blistering guest column for Newsweek announcing the resignations.

The column also pointed out that Trump has still not appointed anyone to head the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, which former president Barack Obama had done 36 days after his own inauguration.

“Within 18 months, that new director and his staff crafted the first comprehensive U.S. HIV/AIDS strategy. By contrast, President Trump appears to have no plan at all,” Schoettes wrote. “Public health is not a partisan issue … If the President is not going to engage on the subject of HIV/AIDS, he should at least continue policies that support people living with and at higher risk for HIV and have begun to curtail the epidemic.”

The column was co-signed by the five other members of the council who had resigned, including Lucy Bradley-Springer, Gina Brown, Ulysses W. Burley III, Grissel Granados and Michelle Ogle. As of Monday morning, their bios remained on PACHA’s government website.

Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded immediately to requests for comment Monday morning. An unnamed White House source told BuzzFeed News that staff members from the domestic policy council had “met with HIV/AIDS representatives several times.”

“I challenge them to identify those times and the people that they met with those times because I’m unaware of those meetings, certainly at a high level,” Schoettes told The Post. “This administration has shown themselves to be anti-science in multiple areas. I don’t know how we can argue policy positions if they don’t use facts.”

PACHA was founded in 1995 under the Department of Health and Human Services to advise the White House on policy matters concerning the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Members are appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for four-year terms; they are not paid and are based throughout the country. Over the last two decades, its members have included physicians, public health specialists, attorneys, healthcare executives and community organizers.

Though there can be up to 25 members on the council, a handful of existing vacancies meant there were only 21 on the board before the mass resignations. Now only 15 remain.

Schoettes said that council’s last in-person meeting was in March, where it continued drafting policy recommendations, knowing that a repeal of Obamacare was among Trump’s top priorities.

“We knew that health-care reform was pending or was likely and we wanted to make sure that our voices and the voices of people with HIV were heard,” he said.

Shortly after that meeting, the council sent a letter to Tom Price, the Trump-appointed secretary of Health and Human Services, and received what Schoettes described as a “perfunctory” response.

The House’s passage of the American Health Care Act in May, despite their pleas and research, was what finally made Schoettes realize the council could be rendered inconsequential under Trump. He explained in his resignation column in Newsweek the consequences that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act could have for people living with HIV:

“People living with HIV know how broken the pre-ACA system was. Those without employer-based insurance were priced out of the market because of pre-existing condition exclusions. And ‘high risk pools’ simply segregated people living with HIV and other health conditions into expensive plans with inferior coverage and underfunded subsidies – subsidies advocates had to fight for tooth-and-nail in every budgetary session.

“Because more than 40 percent of people with HIV receive care through Medicaid, proposed cuts to that program would be extremely harmful. Prior to Medicaid expansion under ACA, a person had to be both very low income and disabled to be eligible for Medicaid.

“For people living with HIV, that usually meant an AIDS diagnosis – making the disease more difficult and expensive to bring under control – before becoming eligible.”

Shortly after the bill’s passage in the House, Schoettes fired off an email to several of his council colleagues. He planned to resign, he announced, because the council was “not going to be able to be effective anymore.” Five of his colleagues agreed.

“As advocates for people living with HIV, we have dedicated our lives to combating this disease and no longer feel we can do so effectively within the confines of an advisory body to a president who simply does not care,” Schoettes wrote. “We hope the members of Congress who have the power to affect healthcare reform will engage with us and other advocates in a way that the Trump Administration apparently will not.”",19/06/2017
The Denver Post,New HIV test on USB stick could change how patients monitor disease themselves,"By Ariana Eunjung Cha, The Washington Post

What if you could measure the amount of HIV in your blood as easily as you check your weight on the scale in your bathroom or take your blood pressure using a home cuff?

That’s the vision of a team of scientists from the Imperial College London and DNA Electronics, who announced Thursday that they had developed a potentially revolutionary gadget to detect an HIV patient’s viral load.

The disposable device, which looks very similar to the USB memory stick that you use to move files from computer to computer, is based on a mobile phone chip. It takes a drop of blood and determines the amount of virus in it. It then creates an electrical signal that can be read by your laptop or other device.

The technology, if perfected, could eventually help identify the presence of all sorts of other foreign invaders in your blood, from hepatitis virus to the presence of bacterial or fungal sepsis. Researchers are also testing ways that the gadget might detect if you’ve become resistant to certain antibiotics — which, if they succeed, would be a major breakthrough in the war against superbugs.

March 5, 2019 American Medical Association, Planned Parenthood challenge Trump family-planning rule If you’ve followed health news over the years, you probably know there’s a take-home test kit for HIV. So how is the USB stick different from that? The answer is that the kit measures HIV antibodies, which can tell you whether you’re infected but not signal the amount of virus in your body — a measure of the severity of the disease over time. People who are HIV-positive monitor their viral levels constantly so that they can tell if their medication is working or if it’s time to move on to something else. The goal for most individuals is to keep the load close to zero, and thanks to a new generation of drugs, those who manage that can live nearly as long as people without HIV.

Graham Cooke, one of the study authors and a clinician scientist in Imperial’s Department of Medicine, explained that the stick could help those who are HIV-positive monitor their viral load more regularly. Typically, they now have to go to a doctor or clinic to get blood drawn, then wait while that sample makes its way to a central testing lab and the numbers are reported back.

“At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result. We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip,” Cooke said.

The research, reported in the journal Scientific Reports, is in the early stages, so there’s still a ways to go before the device might be available to consumers. But the results are very promising: In 991 blood samples, it was able to determine the amount of virus with 95 percent accuracy. And that took, on average, a mere 20.8 minutes.

The idea behind the HIV USB stick — of empowering consumers to access information about themselves that previously had been difficult or even impossible to get — is a seductive notion promoted by several prominent companies. One, 23andMe, aims to help people understand their own DNA. Another, Theranos, promised but couldn’t deliver on quick and cheap pinprick technology that it envisioned would allow people to bypass doctors for lab tests.

Cooke speculated that the stick could be especially beneficial for people in remote locations where getting to a clinic can be difficult.

One of the coolest discoveries about DNA in the past two decades is that it can conduct an electrical current. This finding has sparked countless projects to explore whether the material could help us create smaller, faster and more energy-efficient circuits that overcome the limitations of silicon-based electronics.",11/11/2016
The Denver Post,Howard Dental Center provides life-changing dental work to patients with HIV or AIDS,"During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. in the early 1990s, Dr. John Howard noticed that people were being turned away from dentist offices because they were HIV positive.

So, in 1994, he started Howard Dental Clinic with a group of dentists, to provide a place where patients living with HIV or AIDS could be treated without judgment, said Lili Carrillo, director of oral health care services at Howard Dental.

Staff from the center say the stigma still exists and patients often arrive at the center after being turned away from other dental offices. Some patients travel up to four hours to reach Howard Dental Center on Cherry Creek Drive. Others haven’t had dental care in two years.

One side effect of HIV/AIDS medication is dry mouth, which can lead to cavities and periodontal disease. Dental ailments can exacerbate pre-existing medical problems or create new ones, so the center aims to address health issues by working with other clinics.

In 2014, the center merged with Colorado Health Network, which includes Denver Colorado AIDS Project, Northern Colorado AIDS Project, Southern Colorado AIDS Project and Western Colorado AIDS Project, as a way of streamlining processes and expanding oral health care services throughout the state.

Howard Dental Center also has a network of local surgeons and dental specialists who work on a volunteer basis when their patients need special care.

The Howard Dental Center under the Colorado Health Network umbrella is a 2016 recipient of The Denver Post’s Season to Share funds.

Hazel Ann Harris, the center’s patient services director, helps retain patients and tracks them down when they don’t show up for an appointment or lose touch with the center.

“We do our best to make sure they’re adherent to medication,” she said, adding that she even helps provide people with clothing and furnishings for their houses.

Patients are sometimes wary of dentist offices because of bad experiences disclosing their HIV/AIDS to other doctors, Carrillo said.

“Our patients are survivors,” David Zamboni, a hygienist at the center added, “I’m not talking HIV, I’m talking about life.”

The Denver Post,CU researchers advance test that measures patient use of anti-HIV medication,"A test that estimates how well a patient has adhered to a prescription drug regimen to prevent HIV transmission, developed at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, now has gained widespread use in research internationally.

The technique measures for traces of antiretroviral drugs in dried blood spots to reveal how much of the medication a patient has used over the past couple of months. Researchers at CU’s Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences created the method of taking a sample of blood on a paper-like card and measuring for concentrations of the drugs in dried red blood cells.

The drug builds up in the red blood cells only if it is taken consistently, said Pete Anderson, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at CU whose research is supported by the National Institutes of Health. He added that a similar test may have applications for tracking drugs such as those used to treat Hepatitis-C.",23/08/2016
The Denver Post,Former Swedish Medical Center employee tests positive for HIV,"The former Swedish Medical Center employee facing federal drug theft charges for allegedly stealing syringes with liquid painkillers from the hospital carries HIV, federal prosecutors revealed Wednesday.

Rocky Allen, who agreed to release results of his blood testing, was found to be negative for Hepatitis B and C.

So far, no reported transmissions of HIV or hepatitis B or C have surfaced, the U.S. attorney’s office in Colorado said in a statement. Authorities earlier said Allen carried a bloodborne pathogen, but until Wednesday they had not said which one.

The revelation that Allen carries HIV, subtype b, surfaced on the same day that public health officials announced they had found Swedish, the Englewood hospital that fired Allen in January, deficient for drug auditing procedures as well as infection control and surgical services.

The hospital said it had come up with a plan that corrected issues identified in an April report from the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment. The investigation was prompted by the disclosure of Allen’s arrest on federal drug theft charges.

“The items cited were not directly related to this case,” said Nicole Williams, a spokesman for Swedish. “Upon re-survey, the Health Facilities and Emergency Medical Services Division found Swedish Medical Center to have zero deficiencies.”

Allen worked at Swedish as a surgical technician from August 2015 to January 2016. Swedish reached out to about 3,000 patients who might have been affected by his actions to offer free testing for bloodborne pathogens. Prosecutors said about 2,500 of the patients were tested but that about 500 of those did not participate in recommended follow-up testing. That means there was no testing or incomplete testing for approximately 1,000 patients. Officials encourage those potentially affected patients to take advantage of the free testing still being offered by Swedish.

”Obviously, the positive finding of HIV is everyone’s worst nightmare,” said James Avery, a lawyer who is representing at least 150 former patients at hospitals where Allen worked in four states. “Everyone is scared as hell, and certainly they have every reason to be. Those patients realize there need to be a lot of tests before they are comfortable with their exposure level.”

A federal grand jury in Denver indicted Allen, 28, in February on charges that he had stolen a syringe filled with the painkiller fentanyl intended for patients at Swedish. He has pleaded not guilty.

Those charges followed a witness report that Allen had walked into the wrong operating room, had grabbed a fentanyl syringe and replaced it with a syringe that was found to contain no fentanyl. Authorities have not said whether Allen passed along dirty needles — as was the case with a surgical tech who infected patients with hepatitis C in 2009 — but said his alleged actions put patients at risk of contracting infectious diseases.

Allen also worked at hospitals in Arizona, California and Washington, where officials also have taken steps to offer drug testing. Allen had been fired from at least four hospitals before his hiring by Swedish. He also was court-martialed in 2011 for stealing fentanyl while working as a surgical tech while deployed with an Army unit in Afghanistan while he was a corpsman with the Navy.

“We have made multiple attempts to reach every patient,” Williams said. “Our efforts have met and even exceeded expectations from regulatory agencies. Our actions have been out of an abundance of caution for our public, and we do hope everyone will get tested.”

She added that all patients who required follow-up testing were told so after their initial results.

The April report from the state’s public health officials found that Swedish had failed to maintain accurate drug records and had failed to have a standard process for investigating improper practices regarding controlled medications.

The state’s survey found gaps in drug-use pharmacy audits, which could allow drug diversions by the hospital staff to go undetected. An unnamed registered nurse’s practices with controlled medications also raised concerns at Swedish beginning in October 2014. That nurse, who was a contract employee, continued working for nearly two years at the hospital, which lacked documentation showing that the employee had been counseled or that a drug diversion had occurred, the survey further found.

The state also found in the April report that Swedish failed to ensure medications and supplies “were secured in a manner to avoid division or tampering.”

The surveyor found an unlocked storage cabinet with a saline syringe out of its packaging. A storage cart also had saline syringes and needles accessible to patients, visitors and staffers, the report stated.",01/06/2016
The Denver Post,"Rocky Allen, surgical tech with HIV who stole syringe, sentenced to 6-1/2 years in prison","A federal judge sentenced former surgical technologist Rocky Allen to 6-1/2 years in prison Monday for his theft of a syringe filled with powerful painkillers from Swedish Medical Center in Englewood.

“You got multiple, multiple chances to step away,” U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore told Allen moments before imposing the sentence.

Allen and his lawyer, Timothy O’Hara, an assistant public defender, had sought a sentence of 2-1/2 years in prison. O’Hara argued his client had not actually infected anyone despite a health scare prompted when Swedish warned 2,400 patients to seek medical testing because Allen was HIV positive.

Allen became addicted to drugs to cope with the pain of post traumatic stress disorder caused by sexual abuse that began when he was 3 years old, as well as by the horrors he experienced when he was a surgical tech while deployed as a Navy corpsman in Afghanistan, O’Hara said during the hearing.

“I learned war is horrible,” Allen, dressed in a gray suit, told the judge. “It was a start to a downward spiral to addiction and depression.”

He added: “I was alone on an island only I knew about.”

The judge said that while 2-1/2 years was too lenient, the 10-year sentence the prosecutor Assistant U.S. Attorney Jaime Pena sought was too harsh.

Moore said Allen received a military disability designation after a discharge from the Navy that showed he recognized he struggled with PTSD. He received military benefits that would have allowed him to seek treatment but instead he repeatedly stole drugs from hospitals where he worked, the judge said.

“I don’t believe he gives a damn about people,” the judge said, stressing that Allen had stolen a fentanyl syringe intended for an elderly woman about to undergo surgery. Moore said Allen then went into an operating room while under the influence of fentanyl and marijuana, putting a burn victim he was supposed to tend to at risk.

“The picture of you as a PTSD victim who does not know how to ask for help is a false one,” Moore said when imposing the sentence.

Moore said the drug theft had caused “massive collateral consequences,” which included a cost of about $800,000 to the hospital to test patients for infections. Those patients had to live with the fear that they might have been infected by HIV or hepatitis, the judge said.

Allen pleaded guilty in July to a two-count drug theft indictment related to his theft of a syringe in January while on the job at Swedish. The charges were tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a substance by deceit.

Allen was court-martialed in 2011 while enlisted in the Navy and stationed at a hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan, after he admitted to stealing vials of fentanyl. He was fired from at least five health care facilities in California, Arizona and Washington before Swedish hired him in August 2015.

He was able to continue to find jobs in the health care field by lying about his addiction, drug thefts and work history, prosecutors said in court filings. He even touted his work with a fake company and listed a former boyfriend as a potential reference. In reality, the e-mail for that company was for an account that Allen maintained and answered, according to the prosecution.

The Denver Post,"Swedish Medical Center patients at risk of HIV, hepatitis","Swedish Medical Center is asking about 2,900 patients to get tested for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C after discovering that a former employee may have stolen narcotic pain medicines.

Sgt. Brian Cousineau of the Englewood Police Department said police are investigating 28-year-old Rocky Allen.

The surgical technologist worked in operating rooms at the hospital from Aug. 17 to Jan. 22, officials said Wednesday, and could have put at risk patients who had surgery during that time.

The hospital announced it is investigating possible exposures with the state Department of Public Health and Environment and is reaching out to patients.

“At this point we have no evidence of any patient exposure,” the hospital said. “However, we are taking a position of extreme caution by offering free testing to all patients who had surgery at Swedish Medical Center in locations where this individual worked at any time during this individual’s employment, including those days the employee was not on the schedule or in the facility.”

The Swedish investigation began after an employee allegedly was found diverting drugs Jan. 22.

“This individual was removed from the patient care environment immediately following the alleged suspicious activity,” said Nicole Williams, hospital spokeswoman.

Cousineau said Allen has not been arrested.

“(Swedish officials) have been very cooperative with us,” Cousineau said. “They have aggressively pursued criminal charges in the case.”

According to the state Division of Professions and Occupations, Rocky Elbert Allen obtained a surgical technologist license in July. It was summarily suspended Jan. 29.

The suspension order noted that on Jan. 22, “in the beginning stages of a surgical procedure,” Allen “removed a labeled Fentanyl syringe” from the anesthesia work space “and replaced the Fentanyl syringe with another labeled syringe.”

Allen “submitted to a urinalysis which was positive for Fentanyl and marijuana,” the order said.

Fentanyl is a potent narcotic pain medicine used by anesthesiologists.

The hospital did not explain how patients could have been exposed.

Dr. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer of the state health agency, said potential reuse of needles is the main concern.

Because hospitals track the inventory of needles, one risk is that a drug thief “is taking needles, not just drugs, and replacing them with used needles,” he said.

Wolk also offered an explanation for the time gap between the hospital’s discovery and the widespread notification to surgical patients.

“We had to gather a lot of information,” he said, “working with the hospital and physicians as well as patients.”

Exposure to viruses with long-term health effects also is different, he said, from acute illnesses such as food poisonings that require immediate action.

Happily, “we have no known cases identified to date” among Swedish patients, he said.

Williams said she expects testing to occur over the next several weeks.

She urged people who were not surgery patients between Aug. 17 and Jan. 22 not to call the hospital’s designated patient care line.

“We are receiving an abundance of calls from people who are not in the patient population we are trying to reach, and this is tying up the phone lines,” she said. “Our first priority is to reach these affected patients. If you were not a surgical patient at Swedish between these dates, you are not at risk at this time.”

Department of Public Health and Environment spokesman Mark Salley said he could not comment about testing of the suspect for HIV or hepatitis viruses. Patients will be asked to have their blood tested for all three infections.

In 2009, Denver surgical tech Kristen Diane Parker infected at least 18 hospital patients with hepatitis C by stealing liquid painkillers and leaving behind her dirty syringes. Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center and Audubon Surgery Center of Colorado Springs, was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Colorado adopted tighter regulations of surgical technicians and surgical assistants in the wake of the Parker case. But state legislators are now considering whether to sunset them.

The state Department of Regulatory Affairs reported recently that the regulations appeared to duplicate other state, federal and hospital requirements, and a House hearing is scheduled Feb. 23 to consider whether they are needed.

Diana Protopapa, a lobbyist for state associations of surgical technologists and surgical assistants, said her clients favor state regulation.

“I certainly think another episode like this speaks to the need for regulation,” she said, “and perhaps greater regulation than we have.”

Drug-diversion prevention measures

Two measures were signed into law in Colorado following the case of Kristen Parker, a Denver surgical tech who diverted drugs and exposed 6,000 people to hepatitis C, infecting at least 18, in 2009.

One law required employers to report health care workers under suspicion to the state within two weeks and to make information about a case available to the public, including future employers.

The other law set up a statewide registry of surgical technologists and surgical assistants. Employers were required to verify those workers are in good state standing before allowing them to work. That law is under review. Critics say it duplicates other state, federal and hospital requirements.

What officials are doing in this case

Although there are no known cases of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C stemming from the drug-diversion case at Swedish Medical Center, hospital and state health officials are urging about 2,900 patients who had surgeries from Aug. 17 to Jan. 22 to come in for free testing.

Hospital officials said an incident occurred Jan. 22 that led them to suspect the former employee, a surgical technologist, was diverting drugs. The employee had worked there for about five months. The state health department is concerned because there have been drug-diversion cases in which clean needles were replaced with used ones.",03/02/2016
The Denver Post,"One lawsuit dismissed, another allowed to proceed in case of HIV-positive surgical tech who stole syringes","Judges have issued competing rulings over the validity of lawsuits filed by patients who fear they may have been infected by a former surgical technologist at Swedish Medical Center who stole painkiller syringes while he was HIV positive.

Denver District Court Judge Jay Grant on Thursday dismissed one of the lawsuits because free blood tests offered by Swedish had not found infections among those suing. He ruled that the lack of detected infections meant sufficient injury had not been alleged for those who filed the lawsuit to pursue their claims.

“While plaintiffs state there is a ‘statistically significant’ chance the plaintiffs may test positive for the diseases in the future; the court finds this is too uncertain of a possibility to confer standing on the plaintiffs,” Grant ruled.

On Monday, Denver District Court Judge Catherine Lemon found the opposite, ruling that sufficient injury was alleged to allow another lawsuit to proceed. She found that those suing may still have undiagnosed diseases from contaminated syringes. Further, she ruled the patients had alleged that the theft of their pain medication also caused them to experience great pain during their surgeries. She also found that those suing had alleged harm from having to undergo additional blood testing.

Lemon found that immediate impact did not need to be found to establish an alleged injury. She said heightened risk of contracting a deadly disease could create an unreasonable risk of physical harm.

The competing rulings may be headed to the Colorado Court of Appeals. Joseph Sauder, a Pennsylvania lawyer representing those whose lawsuit was dismissed, said the legal team was still considering whether to file an appeal. James Avery, a lawyer on the case that still is pending, said he continues to prepare for trial.

Nicole Williams, a spokeswoman for Swedish Medical Center, was not available for immediate response.

The lawsuits were filed after the firing by Swedish of Rocky Allen, after he was indicted on federal drug theft charges. Allen, who pleaded guilty in July to the two-count federal indictment, is scheduled to be sentenced in October.

Prosecutors have said Allen was fired from at least five health care facilities in California, Arizona and Washington before Swedish hired him in August. He was court-martialed in 2011 for stealing fentanyl while enlisted in the Navy and stationed at the hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

Prosecutors have said in court documents that Allen was able to continue to find jobs in the health care field by lying about his addiction, drug thefts and work history.

Swedish has offered free medical testing to about 3,000 patients to determine whether they contracted HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. So far, no public disclosures have been made that Allen infected any of those patients.",15/08/2016
The Denver Post,Former health care worker sues Aspen hospital for disclosing he has HIV,"A former employee of the Aspen Valley Hospital District has sued the hospital in U.S. District Court in Denver, claiming his privacy rights were breached when it was disclosed he had HIV.

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday on behalf of the man identified only as John Doe in documents by Denver attorneys Mari Newman, Darold Killmer and Eudoxie Dickey. It indicated that he was an employee and patient at the hospital.

The lawsuit — which names the hospital and five employees, including the hospital’s privacy officer, as defendants — seeks an apology, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys fees from the hospital.

It also seeks policy changes at the hospital for breaching the employee’s privacy, the lawsuit says.

“All patients of Aspen Valley Hospital should be very alarmed by this revelation. When a hospital’s so-called ‘privacy officer’ feels free to disclose a patient’s most private and sensitive health information as cocktail-hour gossip, no Aspen Valley Hospital patient can assume that their medical privacy will be respected,” Newman said in a statement.

Doe worked as an information technology employee at the hospital beginning in 2003 for 11 years before he was fired, the lawsuit says.

“During his 11-year tenure at … (the hospital), plaintiff was an outstanding, respected, well-liked, dedicated and hardworking employee who consistently earned ‘exceeds’ and ‘outstanding’ performance evaluations,” the lawsuit says.

The defendants first breached Doe’s medical status in 2012 “as a piece of conversational gossip over drinks to human resources co-worker Marlene Saleeby in flagrant violation” of the hospital privacy rule mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1993, the lawsuit says. The employee spreading the information had learned it by reviewing “a very large claim about for his anti-viral medications.”

Doe learned of the breach and filed a complaint, which was denied after a “sham” investigation, according to the lawsuit. He then filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in June 2014. Two weeks later, the hospital disciplined Doe for the first time in 11 years in a “retaliatory act,” the lawsuit says.

Doe’s medical symptoms deteriorated as a result of the pressure, and he took a four-week medical leave of absence, the lawsuit says. Two days after his return, Doe was demoted and stripped of numerous responsibilities. His pay was reduced $1,800 a month, the lawsuit says.

Doe filed a third complaint because of the actions against him, and scrutiny against him only increased until he was fired Jan. 22, 2015, the lawsuit says. The resulting loss of health coverage put him at increased risk, the lawsuit says.",15/06/2016
The Denver Post,Former surgical tech carrying HIV pleads guilty to federal drug theft charges,"The prison sentence Rocky Allen faces for stealing a syringe filled with a powerful painkiller could hinge on whether he introduced dirty needles into circulation at the hospital where he worked as a surgical technologist, a federal judge said Tuesday.

U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Moore asked the probation department to investigate whether Allen had previously used the saline syringe that he swapped out with a fentanyl syringe he stole from the hospital where he worked.

“I believe that is an important factor in sentencing,” Moore said.

Allen, 28, who is carrying HIV, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a two-count drug theft indictment related to his theft of the syringe in January while on the job at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood. The judge scheduled sentencing for Oct. 13.

Allen changed his plea from not guilty to guilty on charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit. He appeared in a gray suit and made no statement beyond answering questions posed to him by the judge to establish his competency for the change of plea and to establish the factual basis for the guilty plea.

He admitted that his theft could cause pain to patients undergoing surgery. The painkiller is 100 times more powerful than morphine. The saline syringe in question was not used on a patient because the theft had been detected by the hospital’s staff, but whether it was dirty has not been determined.

Nicole Williams, a spokeswoman for Swedish, declined to reveal if the hospital knows whether Allen had used the needle before. Commenting would interfere with the court case, she said.

Shortly after the court hearing, Allen and his mother hugged each other. They left the courthouse separately, declining to comment to reporters.

“The root of all of this is PTSD,” or post-traumatic stress disorder, said Allen’s lawyer, Timothy O’Hara, an assistant public defender, during the hearing. “It is all about drug abuse.”

In a previous April court hearing, O’Hara said Allen became addicted to fentanyl while stationed with the Navy at a hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan. O’Hara on Tuesday repeated that Allen still grapples with the “massive, massive injuries” he had seen while working on patients in Afghanistan.

Allen has not reached a sentencing deal with prosecutors, and there was some disagreement between them and Allen’s lawyer over a potential sentence.

Federal prosecutors, in a recent court filing, said Allen likely faces a prison sentence of between seven years and three months and 11 years and three months under sentencing guidelines. But that sentence could increase to more than 17 years in prison if additional criminal conduct in the past is discovered, prosecutors added. Allen also faces fines that could reach $300,000.

The defense said in a court filing that the prison term should be between just under four years and just under five years.

The judge, who can depart from any federal sentencing guidelines, told Allen he believed prosecutors likely had overstated the potential sentencing guidelines while the defense had understated those guidelines.

Prosecutors have said Allen was fired from at least five health care facilities in California, Arizona and Washington before Swedish hired him in August. He was court-martialed in 2011 for stealing fentanyl while enlisted in the Navy and stationed at the hospital in Kandahar.

Prosecutors have said in court documents that Allen was able to continue to find jobs in the health care field by lying about his addiction, drug thefts and work history.

Swedish has offered free medical testing to about 3,000 patients to determine whether they contracted HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. So far, no public disclosures have been made that Allen has infected any of those patients.

Williams said about 480 patients who were offered free testing have not undergone it. About 500 of the remaining patients have been tested at least once but have not returned for follow-up testing.

Patients who say they fear they are at risk of contracting AIDS, hepatitis B or hepatitis C have filed lawsuits claiming Swedish was negligent in its hiring and monitoring of Allen.

O’Hara on Tuesday successfully beat back a motion from Assistant U.S. Attorney Jaime Pena to revoke Allen’s current release to a halfway house and have him incarcerated pending sentencing. O’Hara argued that Allen was not at risk of fleeing before sentencing and did not pose a threat to the community.

He said that Allen was undergoing treatment five days a week for PTSD.",12/07/2016
The Denver Post,First gene-edited babies claimed in China,"HONG KONG — A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.

If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.

A U.S. scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.

Many mainstream scientists think it’s too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.

The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus.

He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.

There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.

“I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He told the AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.

Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.

It’s “unconscionable … an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.

“This is far too premature,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. “We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal.”

However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat.”

“I think this is justifiable,” Church said of that goal.

In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems.

It’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it’s not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.

He Jiankui (HEH JEE’-an-qway), who goes by “JK,” studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.

The U.S. scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He’s two companies.

The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.

He said he chose to try embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.

All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.

Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.

He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym “Bai Hua,” told the AP that it’s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.

Here is how He described the work:

The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.

When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.

Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.

Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.

They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.

“It’s almost like not editing at all” if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.

Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.

“In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you’re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,” Musunuru said.

The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ “main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,” Church said.

Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it’s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.

There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.

It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program.

The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he “absolutely” thinks they were able to understand the risks.

Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.

“That might be a layman’s way of describing it,” he said.

Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.

The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they’re adults.

Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a “first” was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.

He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.

Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants’ HIV infection from being disclosed.

“We think this is ethical,” said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.

Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He’s lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.

The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.”

“I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”

The Denver Post,"More than 1,600 patients at Swedish Medical Center get HIV, hepatitis tests; no results divulged","More than 1,600 people have had their blood tested for HIV and hepatitis in the wake of a drug diversion that put patients at risk, Swedish Medical Center said Friday.

But neither hospital nor state officials would say whether anyone has been infected.

Last week, the hospital offered free blood tests to about 2,900 patients who had surgery between Aug. 17 and Jan. 22.

Those dates coincided with the employment of Rocky Allen, a 28-year-old surgical technologist who was fired after a fellow employee reported seeing him steal fentanyl, a powerful narcotic pain medicine.

The Englewood Police Department began a criminal investigation. That has been turned over to the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, which is being assisted by the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Swedish recommended tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. The hospital cannot require tests if patients decline, and others may get tested by their doctors without notifying the hospital.

Of those not yet tested, “we are making every effort to reach those folks,” hospital spokeswoman Nicole Williams said.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment spokesman Mark Salley said the department “will not release numbers of lab tests, positive or negative, during the ongoing investigation.”",12/02/2016
The Denver Post,"More hospitals in U.S. testing patients for HIV, hepatitis after Swedish drug thefts","Three medical facilities in Washington state are warning former patients they should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B because a surgical technologist with an alleged history of drug theft may have exposed them to infection.

More than 1,300 patients at Northwest Hospital & Medical Center, where Rocky Allen worked for about three months ending in March 2012, received a safety notice this week.

Two other medical facilities in the Seattle area where Allen worked also are in the process of notifying patients, but authorities with the Washington Department of Health have not yet identified those facilities.

Allen was fired from Northwest after working there from December 2011 through March 2012.

The warnings in Washington follow the recent indictment on drug theft charges of the former surgical technologist at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood. Allen is carrying a bloodborne pathogen, according to court testimony.

Federal prosecutors allege Allen stole a syringe filled with fentanyl from an operating room while working at Swedish and swapped it with a syringe filled with something else.

Allen had been fired from at least four other hospitals, including Northwest, before his hiring in August at Swedish. He had been court-martialed for fentanyl theft in 2011 while enlisted with the Navy in Afghanistan.

Swedish fired him last month and urged about 2,900 former patients who had surgery while Allen worked there to undergo testing to determine if they were infected. The hospital has not disclosed any test results.

Three other hospitals in Arizona and California also are offering free blood tests to former patients.

The Denver Post,HIV/AIDS patients find needed dental help at Howard Dental,"Five years after being diagnosed with HIV, Matthew Bratrsovsky knows what it is like to be stigmatized by those who fear, or look down on, people who have the virus that causes AIDS.

Once, when he had pancreatitis, an ambulance driver who was taking him to a hospital greeted him by saying, “Oh, you’re the guy with AIDS.”

But Bratrsovsky, 34, wants people to know this: “You are a person, you are not the guy with AIDS.”

Bratrsovsky is thankful he can let his guard down at Howard Dental Center, a nonprofit that offers dental services to HIV-positive and AIDS patients.

“I feel like a friend when I come here. You don’t feel afraid,” he said after an examination by dentist Alfonso Salazar-Celi.

The organization, a Colorado Health Network program that has been in operation since 1994, treated 747 patients — and took 3,700 visits — in fiscal year 2014.

Howard provides a full range of dental services to HIV patients who can’t afford private treatment. Their disease and treatment can leave them highly vulnerable to dental problems.

Some have been turned away by dentists who fear treating those with HIV/AIDS. “They believe they are going to be infected,” said Salazar-Celi.

Drugs used to treat the infection can cause dry mouth, a condition that leads to gum problems and cavities. Jayson Richardson, 36, who lost 14 teeth to gum disease, came to Howard to be fitted for partial dentures.

Richardson is among the patients who require frequent visits to the dental hygienist for preventive care. “The teeth he still has, we try to keep in good shape,” Salazar-Celi said.

When the work can’t be done at the center, patients are sent to specialists.

Good oral health fosters a stronger immune system, which is vital for those with HIV/AIDS.

If tooth decay and other bacterial infections that begin in the mouth aren’t treated, they can spread into the bloodstream and damage the heart and other organs. People with HIV/AIDS may have compromised immune systems that leave them vulnerable to opportunistic infections.

Patients who lose teeth at an early age also face problems getting nutrients needed to support a healthy weight, said Lili Carrillo, director of oral health care services at Howard.

“It is also an issue of self-esteem,” she said.

Howard has a partnership with the University of Colorado, which provides fourth-year dental students to work at the clinic.

The Community College of Denver provides the center with dental hygiene students, who do preventive care, as well as the one full-time hygienist on staff.

“Their students rotate through our office,” Carrillo said, “and we help train the dentists of tomorrow.”

The Denver Post,"Class action suit filed in drug theft case at Swedish hospital that put thousands at risk for hepatitis, HIV","A class-action federal lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges Swedish Medical Center negligently put thousands of patients in danger by hiring a surgical technologist who the hospital now says may have exposed them to HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

In January, the Englewood hospital fired Rocky Allen, who has since been indicted on two federal counts alleging he was caught stealing a syringe filled with fentanyl from an operating room. Allen has pleaded not guilty.

Court records show that by the time Swedish hired him, Allen had been fired from four other hospitals and also had been court-martialed in 2011, when he was serving with the Navy in Afghanistan, for the theft of fentanyl. Court testimony revealed that he is carrying an undisclosed bloodborne pathogen.

“By the time Allen appeared on the doorstep of SMC in August 2015 looking for a job as a surgical technician, all the warning signs of what would later occur at SMC were present,” the lawsuit states. “Allen already had been terminated by numerous other hospitals for the exact conduct that has now exposed thousands of SMC patients at an increased risk of bloodborne pathogens.”

Officials with Swedish could not be reached for comment.

The lawsuit names three plaintiffs, Angelica Porras, Catherine Pecha and Gary Wolter, but seeks class-action status for all individuals who had surgery at Swedish between Aug. 17 and Jan. 22. The hospital has offered free blood tests to 2,900 patients.

Each of the three named plaintiffs has received negative test results for the three viruses, the lawsuit states. But all three were told that despite those test results, they remain at risk and should pursue continued blood testing, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit claims the hospital negligently hired Allen, negligently inflicted emotional distress and failed to properly supervise Allen after hiring him.

Named as defendants are Swedish and its parent companies, Hospital Corp. of America and HealthONE of Denver Inc. The lawsuit states that another HealthONE hospital, Rose Medical Center, had another drug-theft scandal.

In that case, Kristen Parker, a former Rose Medical surgical technician, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2010 for swapping drug-filled syringes, intended for patients, with previously injected, non-sterile syringes. She infected at least 18 hospital patients with hepatitis C.

After that sentencing, Rose Medical released a statement that it had upgraded systems for policing medications in the operating room, the lawsuit states.",08/03/2016
The Denver Post,Report: Proposed U.S. cuts to AIDS funding could cause millions of deaths,"The State Department is trumpeting U.S. progress combating HIV and AIDS worldwide, but NGOs warn that the Trump administration’s plans to slash AIDS funding could lead to millions more infected, with many dying.

“The U.S. government, under the leadership of President Trump, continues to lead the way in the global HIV/AIDS response,” said Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan at a State Department event on Thursday commemorating World AIDS Day, which is Dec. 1. “We are closer than ever before to ending this pandemic,” he said.

A blistering new report from the ONE Campaign, an international nonprofit focused on poverty and preventable disease, argues that the administration’s proposed budget cuts would derail all the progress made to date, just when an end to the disease is in sight.

The Trump budget “would have led to the first global increase in new HIV infections since 1995, with nearly 200,000 additional HIV infections in the first year,” according to the report, “Red Ribbon or White Flag? The future of the U.S. Global AIDS Response.”

In its budget proposal for fiscal year 2018, the Trump administration proposed cutting some $800 million from the global fight against HIV and AIDS, including the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a program former President George W. Bush established in 2003. PEPFAR has provided treatment to nearly 8 million HIV-infected people in developing countries and is estimated to have saved some 11 million lives.

New proposed cuts, if enacted, could force initiatives such as PEPFAR to scale back their treatment programs, potentially leading to 26 million additional infections and 4 million additional deaths in the next 15 years in sub-Saharan Africa alone, the report said. “The billions of dollars that Congress has already invested in fighting AIDS would be squandered at the very moment when control of the disease is in sight,” it said.

The Trump administration’s proposed budget request calls for eliminating PEPFAR funding entirely to seven countries – Brazil, Djibouti, Liberia, Mali, Nepal, Senegal, and Sierra Leone – and reducing funding to 17 countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and other sub-Saharan African countries still struggling to recover from the disease: South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Namibia. Seventy percent of the nearly 37 million people with HIV/AIDS globally are in sub-Saharan Africa, and only half receive treatment.

U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Ambassador Deborah Birx declined to respond to the ONE Campaign report, but told reporters Thursday that the United States has “dramatically increased results” in 2017 even with a flat budget, and that lower funding doesn’t mean a lessened commitment.

“Translating that money into the most effective programs that we can that reaches the most lives in the most impactful way, that’s our job,” she said.

ONE Campaign spokesman Sean Simons said advocacy groups are pinning their hopes on Congress to stop Trump’s plan. “If the Trump administration once again tries to cut funding for global HIV/AIDS programs in the future, Congress must do the responsible thing and restore the money,” he said.

On Wednesday, a group of 40 advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress urging them to push back against the Trump administration’s plans to slash global health funding. “We are writing to sound the alarm,” the letter said.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have pushed back on the Trump administration’s budget proposals, especially the drastic cuts to the State Department and USAID. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, took aim at the proposed PEPFAR cuts on Friday.

“Success is possible,” he said. “Cutting funding now – shrinking from our commitment now, instead of sustaining it – will negate the investments and progress we have made so far.”",01/12/2017
The Denver Post,"Porter Adventist Hospital extends period patients may have been at risk of contracting disease, suspends all surgeries for now","Porter Adventist Hospital, which days ago warned about a breach in the sterilization process of surgical tools that could have put their patients at risk of contracting serious diseases, is now offering patients who underwent orthopedic or spine surgical procedures between July 21, 2016, and April 5 of this year testing for bloodborne pathogens.

“We will be notifying these patients directly via a written letter and will be providing additional information regarding surgical site infection,” read a Friday afternoon statement from hospital spokeswoman Chrissy Nicholson. “As always, we are committed to patient safety and supporting them through this process.”

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the risk of contracting hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV from the breach is “unknown, but is considered low.”

The hospital announced late Thursday night they would be canceling most surgeries Friday due to “a potential change in our water quality relative to our surgical equipment,” Nicholson wrote in a statement.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment officials conducted an additional on-site survey Thursday afternoon, noting that they hadn’t identified any infections a result of the breach but that they were still investigating.

“Porter has voluntarily suspended all surgical procedures and closed all operating rooms until the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment determines it is safe to resume,” the department said in a Friday news release.

On Wednesday, the hospital announced an infection-control breach involving surgical tools may have put some surgery patients at risk for contracting hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

The breach may have affected patients who had orthopedic or spine surgery between July 21, 2016, and Feb. 20. The risk of getting HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C is “very low,” said Larry Wolk, the executive director and chief medical officer for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The hospital did not immediately respond when asked how many patients could have been impacted. Wolk directed the inquiry back to Porter.

On Friday, Nicholson responded to questions from the Denver Post by saying the hospital would not be answering further questions about any of the incidents at this time.",06/04/2018
The Denver Post,Colorado House OKs bill on medical marijuana use for autism,"DENVER — Colorado’s House has passed a bill allowing medical marijuana use to treat autism spectrum disorders.

The bill had strong bipartisan support, passing 63-0 on Thursday.

The Senate is expected to do the same, and Gov. Jared Polis has pledged to sign it.

Autism spectrum disorders include autism, Asperger syndrome and other developmental disorders whose symptoms range from mild to severe.

Current law allows medical marijuana use for cancer, glaucoma, HIV, PTSD, seizures and severe pain.

The legislation streamlines procedures for minors to be added to Colorado’s medical marijuana registry. It also encourages state research into ovarian cancer, dementia and other medical conditions.

Then-Gov. John Hickenlooper vetoed a similar bill last year. He cited a need for more research into marijuana’s benefits for patients with an autism spectrum disorder.",07/02/2019
The Denver Post,Coloradans deserve treatment not torture during incarceration,"Every day in Colorado, people addicted to opioids get arrested. Without medication, they experience excruciating pain, sweating, puking, begging for relief. However, for most incarcerated people in Colorado, there is no relief.

Incarceration is a turning point in the lives of individuals who are addicted to opioids.

For many, it is the beginning of a cycle of crime, incarceration and release; 68 percent of drug offenders are reincarcerated within three years.

For others, this cycle has an even more permanent end: fatal overdose. People leaving incarceration are 129 times more likely to overdose fatally than the general public.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the gold standard for treatment of opioid addiction. MAT consists of three medications, including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. No other treatments come close to MAT’s effectiveness in reducing opioid use and overdoses.

Buprenorphine and methadone decrease overdose deaths by half. Nearly as significantly, they reduce criminality. In a Yale study, people on methadone were ten times less likely to be rearrested for drug charges. People on MAT also decrease their risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis C, reducing the public’s risk of stumbling upon an HIV-infected syringe. Finally, the medications financially benefit the public, with benefit-cost ratios from 7:1 to 15:1.

Historically, patients on MAT are tapered off these medications upon incarceration. Some are even discontinued without tapering, creating high risk of withdrawal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and, at times, death.

Currently, only two correctional facilities in Colorado maintain patients on medication-assisted treatment: Denver City Jail and Arapahoe County.

Arapahoe allows any inmate who is receiving treatment at a nearby narcotic treatment program to continue their medication, including all three drug types. This program is the first of its kind in the state.

In other counties, inmates are withdrawn from drugs, creating morbidity and liability for counties. In Jefferson County, 37-year-old mother Jennifer Lobato suffered an agonizing death from acute opioid withdrawal. Her unnecessary death — easily preventable with medication-assisted treatment — cost the county and other defendants $2.5 million that was paid out in a settlement agreement.

Pregnant women with addiction are an especially vulnerable population when they are incarcerated. The fetus is at risk for miscarriage when they are forced into opioid withdrawal. Most jails lack effective protocols for pregnant, addicted women.

But there are states reducing their overdose rates and improving public safety.

Connecticut recently began providing methadone to about 50 inmates; they are expanding this program since it resulted in higher levels of staff satisfaction and few adverse incidents. Rhode Island in 2017 began offering medication to all inmates. This project has succeeded at reducing opioid overdoses after release; in its first six months, opioid overdoses in people recently incarcerated dropped by 65 percent. In fact, the entire state’s overdose rate dropped by 12 percent, largely driven by the reduction in overdoses by people recently released.

It is the standard of care for inmates to continue on their prior medications while incarcerated, but this standard is violated for opioid treatment, often with fatal results.

The Colorado legislature’s Opioid Interim Study Committee has the opportunity to end the pattern of incarcerated people withdrawing and then overdosing upon release.

Colorado can save hundreds of lives and improve its public safety by offering treatment for addiction in jails and prisons.

The Denver Post,Gonorrhea infections are increasing in the Denver metro area and many are resistant to antibiotics,"Gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted bacterial infection that can cause infertility, is on the rise in metro Denver, and many of the new cases are showing stubborn resistance to the traditional antibiotic treatment.

Since 2012, gonorrhea cases and rates have roughly doubled in Colorado, and nearly two-thirds of those cases occur in the metro area. The disease is usually dispatched quickly through doses of two separate antibiotics, said Dr. Karen Wendel, the director of STD/HIV Prevention and Control at Denver Public Health.

But doctors in the city are increasingly seeing cases that are resistant, though not immune, to one of those antibiotics. Wendel said about 15 percent of the cases that Denver Public Health now sees have lowered sensitivity to the antibiotic azithromycin.

Thus far, Colorado hasn’t seen a case where treatment completely failed. But such failures have been reported in Canada and other countries — the result of gonorrhea infections increasingly able to outsmart the standard medicines and requiring more aggressive, though less tested, treatments.

This rising resistance makes early detection of gonorrhea all the more important, so that someone infected with a resistant strain doesn’t spread it widely, Wendel said. But therein lies another challenge in battling the rise in gonorrhea: most people who have gonorrhea don’t show symptoms.

Typical symptoms include a burning sensation when urinating or abnormal discharge from the genitals. A gonorrhea infection, though, can be spread through vaginal, anal or oral sex, and symptoms that do show up can often be mistaken as something else.

That’s why Wendel said it is important for people to be screened regularly, with people who have multiple sexual partners, people with new partners, men who have sex with men and people with HIV all recommended to receive more frequent screening.

“What we see with gonorrhea is the majority of it is occurring in folks who are less than 30,” Wendel said. “But we certainly see infected patients who are up into their 50s and beyond.”

In 2016, there were 1,975 cases of gonorrhea reported in Denver, and 5,975 cases reported statewide. Wendel said the increase could be due to multiple factors.

“We think it may be gaps in screening,” she said, “or it may be changes in condom use.”",14/12/2017
The Denver Post,Proposed El Paso County needle exchange hits roadblock at Board of Health,"A needle exchange won’t be opening in El Paso County for the foreseeable future.

The proposed program met quick — and occasionally stiff — opposition from most of the county’s nine Board of Health members during their meeting Monday morning.

Though no formal vote was held, a majority of the board told El Paso County Public Health employees not to pursue an agreement with a nonprofit to create an exchange along Colorado Springs’ west side — effectively killing the measure.

The exchange aimed to dispose of used syringes and offer free needles to people who inject drugs, as a means to combat the spread of hepatitis C and HIV amid a nationwide epidemic of heroin and illicit opioid use.

“There are other compassionate ways to address this that need to be brought forward,” said El Paso County Commissioner Longinos Gonzalez.

The Denver Post,Can Denver quash AIDS by 2030? The city is ahead on international health goals,"Shannon Southall remembers it was 10:30 on an April morning nearly 25 years ago when her life screeched off its path.

It was 1992, and she was the first person her doctor had ever diagnosed with HIV. Southall, who was infected by her cheating fiance, had only asked for the blood test as a routine follow-up after she was poked with a needle during her work as a medical assistant.

Southall, now 52 and director of a Denver advocacy organization for people living with HIV and AIDS, was diagnosed early, began a drug regimen almost immediately and reached “viral suppression” in 1997, meaning there was no detectable virus in her blood. She is the model patient, one who has accomplished all three goals set by the international health community to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.

To get there, Denver — along with many other cities across the world — pledged to meet three measures by 2020: 90 percent of people with HIV know they have it, 90 percent of those diagnosed are receiving care and 90 percent of those in care have, thanks to medication, no detectable virus in their blood.

Denver is two-thirds of the way there, officially reaching a 90 percent diagnosis rate earlier this year and, this fall, achieving the “viral suppression” benchmark.

The toughest measure for Colorado has been getting 90 percent of people diagnosed with HIV into medical care, said Dr. Sarah Rowan, director of HIV and viral hepatitis prevention at Denver Public Health. Everyone living with HIV should see a doctor at least once a year, and many patients need multiple visits. Yet only about 75 percent of Denver residents with HIV showed up at a medical appointment within the past year, according to data from Denver Public Health.

Beginning in 2017, public health officials will intensify efforts to track patients who haven’t been to the doctor and call them.

The city’s Department of Environmental Health plans to attack that health measure as aggressively as it has the first two, with what Mayor Michael Hancock calls “one of the most comprehensive networks supporting people living with HIV.” The department’s “office of HIV resources” distributes $7.9 million in federal funding, much of it for prevention and treatment programs at Children’s Hospital, Denver Public Health, and the University of Colorado Hospital.

The medical centers have ramped up testing, diagnosis and financial help to cover prescription costs.

Denver Public Health offers free or low-cost testing weekly at the LGBT Community Center, the downtown nonprofit HeyDenver, the Denver Swim Club and the Midtowne Spa, all popular hangouts among gay men, the most at-risk population along with people who have sex with multiple partners. People ages 25-29, who grew up in an age when HIV infection is a chronic, manageable condition rather than a deadly diagnosis, comprise another high-risk group.

The majority of those whose test results are positive are linked to a clinic within 30 days.

About 1,800 people with HIV are patients at the University of Colorado infectious disease clinic, where pharmacy manager Jasjit Gill helps them get free or reduced-cost medication through the state’s AIDS drug assistance program. The once-a-day pill to treat people with HIV costs about $3,000 per month, although Medicaid government insurance covers most of the cost of the prescription.

About half of the pharmacy’s patients are receiving state assistance for prescription costs. Some of them are homeless, which makes it hard for staff to follow up with them. “The hardest part is getting people to show up here,” Gill said. “How do they even put down an address?”

Out of all patients with HIV who visited a doctor or clinic within the past year, 90 percent were in viral suppression — part three of the three-step international goal. That means medication to suppress the virus was reduced so that it is not detectable through a simple blood test, although an antibody test still would detect antibodies. Patients in viral suppression do not progress to AIDS and the possibility of disease transmission is dramatically reduced.

Public funding also goes toward marketing campaigns, including one called “Denver Brings It Up.” The ads, mostly on gay-dating websites, encourage testing and offer information on PREP, a daily pill that can prevent HIV infection.

The first case of AIDS in Colorado was diagnosed in 1982, and since then, 19,100 people have been diagnosed with HIV. More than 6,000 have died. An estimated 12,900 Coloradans are now living with HIV.

Nationally, the number of new HIV cases fell 19 percent from 2005 to 2014. An estimated 14 percent of people with HIV in the United States do not know they have it, compared with 10 percent in Denver. The percentage is derived by estimating the prevalence of the disease and subtracting the number of diagnosed cases.

The 2020 goal is a step toward ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, a worldwide effort led by the United Nations. In logistical terms, the end of the epidemic means new HIV cases are rare, and when they occur, they do not progress to AIDS. “They will go on and live long, healthy lives,” Rowan said.

Southall’s life took an abrupt “right instead of taking a left” the day her doctor told her she had HIV. At 26 years old, she drove straight to her family in Greeley. Although they were supportive, for years they washed her dishes separate from their own and were concerned about showering after her, and one brother-in-law refused to let her see his children. A new boyfriend freaked out when he learned she had the virus. “All that stigma, thrown at me by my own family,” she said.

Southall got married six years ago, and because the virus in her blood is suppressed, her husband has not been infected. Her first drug regimen required her setting an alarm to take medication at 3 a.m., one of 20 pills each day. Now she takes just three.

The diagnosis also led to a new career. Southall founded and then ran the Women’s Lighthouse Project for 13 years, helping women with HIV find medical care. Now she heads Rocky Mountain Cares, which works on prevention, education and medical-care management for people living with HIV.

Besides the 90-90-90 international goals, Southall’s organization is working to eliminate stigma and the perception that someone who asks for an HIV test has been “sleeping around or using drugs,” she said.

“This is a health issue, not a behavior issue,” Southall said. “It should be part of a regular test at the doctor if you are single and sexually active. The biggest barrier to that is the stigma that comes along with having to ask for an HIV test because you’ve ‘done something.'”",18/12/2016
The Denver Post,"Judge sides with AIDS Healthcare Foundation, dismisses suit","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A federal judge ruled in favor of one of the nation’s largest suppliers of HIV and AIDS medical care, clearing it of wrongdoing in an alleged $20 million scam to bilk the federal government.

Three former managers of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed a federal lawsuit in South Florida in 2014 alleging the company paid employees and patients kickbacks for patient referrals to boost funding from federal health programs. Employees were paid $100 for referring patients with positive test results to its clinics and pharmacies.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams ruled in a decision unsealed this week that bonus payments were not subject to a 1972 law aimed at stopping unethical referrals because they fall under the statute’s employee safe harbor provision.

The lawsuit claimed the kickbacks started in 2010 at the company’s California headquarters and spread to programs in Florida and several other locations.

An attorney for the plaintiffs, Theodore Leopold, said in an email Friday that “we respect the ruling by the court but look forward to the appeal.”

The organization’s president, Michael Weinstein, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing, saying when the lawsuit was filed that the small financial incentives for linking people to services and keeping them there are “mainstays of public health interventions.”

He said the proactive approach is critical to stopping HIV in the U.S. and to providing lifesaving care.

The Los Angeles-based company cares for more than 400,000 patients in 36 countries and is leading a mass testing initiative to identify and treat an estimated 25 million people who don’t know they are infected, according to its website.",24/06/2017
The Denver Post,Porter Adventist Hospital cancels more surgeries following sterilization breach,"Porter Adventist Hospital is canceling most surgeries Friday, a day after it warned people of a breach in the sterilization process of medical instruments used for certain surgeries over the past two years.

The announcement comes after hospital officials noticed “a potential change in our water quality relative to our surgical equipment,” according to a statement from Porter Adventist Hospital spokeswoman Chrissy Nicholson.

The revelation prompted Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment officials to conduct an additional on-site survey Thursday afternoon, noting that while they had “not identified any infections caused as a result of this breach,” they were still investigating “whether additional patients may be at risk,” Dr. Larry Wolk, the CDPHE executive director and chief medical officer, said in a statement.

“The risk of harm from this incident continues to be unknown, but it is thought to be low,” he said.

Because the investigation is ongoing, he said, the hospital voluntarily canceled most surgeries scheduled for Thursday and Friday.

On Wednesday, hospital officials said they were notifying people who had orthopedic or spinal surgeries between July 21, 2016, and Feb. 20 of this year about the breach, which the hospital said could have put some patients at risk of hepatitis B or C, or HIV.

Wolk said the hospital on Wednesday mailed letters to patients who had surgery during the affected period and has established a hotline for patient questions. The phone number to call is 303-778-5694.

The Denver Post,Democrat Jared Polis says more women likely to die if Walker Stapleton is elected governor,"U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, the Democratic candidate for governor, suggested Thursday that women would die at a faster rate if his opponent Walker Stapleton wins the November election.

“If Walker Stapleton was elected, mortality for women would likely go up with these policies he’s advocating, the HIV infection rate would go up,” he said, flanked by employees and volunteers at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.

Polis made the comments after an employee from Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado, a political arm of the health care organization, suggested maternal mortality was extremely high in Texas due in part to a lack of access to clinics such as Planned Parenthood.

However, a reporting error is partly to blame for the sharp increase in Texas, a new report found. In the same report, researchers said there were likely many causes for the spike, including an increase in chronic diseases.

The Polis campaign was at the northeast Denver health clinic to discuss women’s health and abortion rights. Health care is expected to be a top issue in the fall race to succeed Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper.

Abortion rights have long been a political flashpoint in partisan politics. The gubernatorial candidates’ positions fall along traditional party lines. Polis supports access to abortion. During The Denver Post’s Republican gubernatorial primary debate, Stapleton said he would be “a pro-life governor.”

Michael Fortney, Stapleton’s campaign manager, responded to Polis’ comment.

“As a husband and a father who reads to his two young girls every night before they go to sleep, it’s disgusting to see Jared Polis sink to such outlandish and false attacks in an attempt to scare women into voting for him,” Fortney said. “Jared Polis should be ashamed of himself and this revolting comment should be condemned by Coloradans across the political spectrum.”

Polis spoke just days before the U.S. Senate is scheduled to begin hearings on President Donald Trump’s newest Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. If approved, Kavanaugh is expected shift the court to the right. Since his nomination, supporters of abortion rights have raised concern that he could provide a crucial fifth vote to overturn the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade.

Kavanaugh has said that he believes Roe v. Wade is settled law. His critics, including Polis, aren’t taking him for his word.

Polis said Thursday he’d lead the way in enshrining abortion rights into Colorado law.

“Truly, we will lose the national backdrops of protections we have,” he said of a possible Kavanaugh confirmation. “We would look forward to enshrining reproductive choice into law so that women can be assured that nine judges in Washington — five judges in Washington — aren’t taking away their rights.”",30/08/2018
The Denver Post,"CDC gets list of forbidden words: fetus, transgender, diversity","By Lena H. Sun and Juliet Eilperin, The Washington Post

Trump administration officials are forbidding officials at the nation’s top public health agency from using a list of seven words or phrases – including “fetus” and “transgender” – in any official documents being prepared for next year’s budget.

Policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were told of the list of forbidden words at a meeting Thursday with senior CDC officials who oversee the budget, according to an analyst who took part in the 90-minute briefing. The forbidden words are: “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based” and “science-based.”

In some instances, the analysts were given alternative phrases. Instead of “science-based” or “evidence-based,” the suggested phrase is “CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes,” the person said. In other cases, no replacement words were immediately offered.

The question of how to address such issues as sexual orientation, gender identity and abortion rights – all of which received significant visibility under the Obama administration – has surfaced repeatedly in federal agencies since President Donald Trump took office. Several key departments – including Health and Human Services, which oversees CDC, as well as Justice, Education and Housing and Urban Development – have changed some federal policies and how they collect government information about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.

In March, for example, HHS dropped questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in two surveys of elderly people.

HHS has also removed information about LGBT Americans from its website. The department’s Administration for Children and Families, for example, archived a page that outlined federal services that are available for LGBT people and their families, including how they can adopt and receive help if they are the victims of sex trafficking.

At the CDC, the meeting about the banned words was led by Alison Kelly, a senior leader in CDC’s Office of Financial Services, according to the CDC analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Kelly did not say why the words are being banned, according to the analyst, and told the group that she was merely relaying the information.

Other CDC officials confirmed the existence of a list of forbidden words. It’s likely that other parts of HHS are operating under the same guidelines regarding the use of these words, the analyst said.

At the CDC, several offices have responsibilities for work that uses some of these words. The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention is working on ways to prevent HIV among transgender people and reduce health disparities. The CDC’s work on birth defects caused by the Zika virus, for example, includes research on the developing fetus.

The ban is related to the budget and supporting materials that are to be given to CDC’s partners and to Congress, the analyst said. The president’s budget for 2019 is expected to be released in early February. The budget blueprint is generally shaped to reflect an administration’s priorities.

Federal agencies are sending in their budget proposals to the Office of Management and Budget, which has authority about what is included.

Neither an OMB spokesman nor a CDC spokeswoman responded to requests for comment Friday.

The longtime CDC analyst, whose job includes writing descriptions of the CDC’s work for the administration’s annual spending blueprint, could not recall a previous time when words were banned from budget documents because they were considered controversial.

The reaction of people in the meeting was “incredulous,” the analyst said. “It was very much, ‘Are you serious? Are you kidding?’ ”

“In my experience, we’ve never had any pushback from an ideological standpoint,” the analyst said.

News of the ban on certain words hasn’t yet spread to the broader group of scientists at the CDC, but it’s likely to provoke a backlash, the analyst said. “Our subject matter experts will not lay down quietly – this hasn’t trickled down to them yet.”

The CDC has a budget of about $7 billion and more than 12,000 employees working across the nation and around the globe on everything from food and water safety to heart disease and cancer to infectious disease outbreak prevention. Much of the CDC’s work has strong bipartisan support.

Kelly told the analysts that “certain words” in the CDC’s budget drafts were being sent back to the agency for corrections. Three words that had been flagged in these drafts were “vulnerable,” “entitlement” and “diversity.” Kelly told the group she had been authorized to give verbal instructions about the remaining banned words.",15/12/2017
The Denver Post,"Human Rights Campaign gives Denver a perfect score for its LGBTQ laws, policies and services","The Human Rights Campaign has given Denver a perfect score for the city’s inclusivity — in terms of laws, policies and services — toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

Mayor Michael Hancock’s office says Denver is the first Colorado city to receive a perfect score, which came from the civil rights organization’s 2017 Municipal Equality Index.

“In Denver, we stand firmly for the ideals of inclusion, acceptance and opportunity. These are our values,” Hancock said in a written statement. “We will continue to keep Denver a city that is welcoming to all by standing together against hate and never allowing it to divide our city. We have worked hard to achieve this score, and I’m grateful to the members of my LGBTQ Commission for leading the way.”

Denver was one of less than 70 municipalities nationwide that received a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign.

The organization examined Denver’s nondiscrimination laws, city employment policies and even law enforcement as part of its study.

Denver was given bonus points for providing services to people with HIV/AIDS and for having openly LGBTQ elected or appointed municipal leaders.

“Denver continues to be a leader as a world-class city for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Coloradans and their families, and we are proud of the work they’ve done to support LGBTQ people,” Daniel Ramos, executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy group One Colorado, said in a statement. “We hope other cities in Colorado will look to Denver as a model for how to treat their LGBTQ residents with dignity and respect.”",19/10/2017
The Denver Post,FDA seeks removal of opioid painkiller from the market,"By Laurie McGinley and Lenny Bernstein, The Washington Post

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday asked a drug company to remove its opioid pain medication from the market, the first time the agency has made such a request because of the public health consequences of abuse.

The agency concluded after an extensive review of Endo Pharmaceuticals’ Opana ER that the “benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks.” The company reformulated the drug in 2012 to make it more difficult to snort, but the FDA said that move actually led to more injections – and a major HIV outbreak.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who has pledged to take “more forceful” steps to curb the nation’s opioid epidemic, said the agency’s action reflects its increased focus on the risks posed by the illicit use of opioids. The FDA “is looking broadly at the whole policy framework” used for the painkillers, he said in an interview Thursday.

The medication was approved in 2006 for moderate-to-severe pain when a round-the-clock painkiller is needed. During the drug’s reformulation, Endo introduced a coating designed to deter people from crushing and snorting the medication. But the FDA declined to give it an “abuse deterrent” label, saying the data didn’t support such a designation.

The FDA said Thursday that subsequent data showed a “significant shift” in the route of abuse “from nasal to injection” after the reformulation. Increased needle-sharing of the drug has since been linked to serious blood disorder cases in Tennessee in 2012 and a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in Indiana, officials said.

In March, an FDA advisory committee voted 18-8 that the benefits of the reformulated Opana ER no longer outweighed the risks it posed.

“The abuse and manipulation of reformulated Opana ER by injection has resulted in a serious disease outbreak,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement Thursday. “When we determined that the product had dangerous unintended consequences, we made a decision to request its withdrawal from the market.”

If the company declines to remove the product, the FDA will take steps to formally require its removal by withdrawing agency approval.

In a statement, the company said it was reviewing the FDA’s request but that it “remains confident in the body of evidence established through clinical research demonstrating that Opana ER has a favorable risk-benefit profile when used as intended in appropriate patients.”

Michael Botticelli, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy for nearly three years under President Barack Obama, called the FDA action “a real encouraging step. It sounds as if the FDA is using expanded criteria in the way they look at opioids.”

The agency has been criticized in the past for examining the safety and effectiveness of individual opioid painkillers without considering the wider impact each could have on the nation’s epidemic.

“This falls in line, I think, with their recently released guidance on how they were going to think of drugs and drug approval,” Botticelli said.

From 2000 to 2015, nearly 180,000 Americans died from overdoses of prescription opioids, and tens of thousands more have succumbed to heroin and fentanyl overdoses as the crisis has evolved.

Opana ER brought in $158 million in sales last year for Endo, a 10 percent drop from 2015 because of generic competition, according to FiercePharma, a trade site. The company, which is based in Dublin and has its U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania, recently announced two rounds of job cuts.",09/06/2017
The Denver Post,Lawsuit against Swedish Medical adds company that did Rocky Allen background check,"A class action lawsuit brought against Swedish Medical Center saying it was negligent in hiring a surgical technologist who stole drugs and exposed patients to HIV, hepatitis B and C has added the company that performed Rocky Allen’s background check for the hospital.

Court documents show PreCheck Inc., a Texas corporation, has been added to the suit, according to court documents.

Swedish and HealthONE of Denver Inc. recently disclosed that PreCheck performed the background hiring check on Allen, who was sentenced in November to 6-1/2 years in prison by a federal judge.

A class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Denver court alleges patients were exposed to HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, in part, due to the hospital’s negligence in hiring Allen.

The Englewood hospital fired Allen, who has since been convicted in federal court for stealing a syringe filled with fentanyl from an operating room.

Court records show that by the time Swedish hired him, Allen had been fired from four other hospitals and also had been court-martialed in 2011, when he was serving with the Navy in Afghanistan, for the theft of fentanyl.

“By the time Allen appeared on the doorstep of SMC in August 2015 looking for a job as a surgical technician, all the warning signs of what would later occur at SMC were present,” the lawsuit states. “Allen already had been terminated by numerous other hospitals for the exact conduct that has now exposed thousands of SMC patients at an increased risk of bloodborne pathogens.”

The lawsuit names three plaintiffs, Angelica Porras, Catherine Pecha and Gary Wolter, but sought class-action status for all individuals who had surgery at Swedish between Aug. 17, 2015, and Jan. 22, 2016. The plaintiffs seek economic and compensatory damages.

The hospital offered free blood tests to 2,900 patients.

Each of the three named plaintiffs has received negative test results for the three viruses, the lawsuit states. But all three were told that despite those test results, they remain at risk and should pursue continued blood testing, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit claims the hospital negligently hired Allen, negligently inflicted emotional distress and failed to properly supervise Allen after hiring him.

Named as defendants are Swedish and its parent companies, Hospital Corp. of America and HealthONE of Denver. The lawsuit states that another HealthONE hospital, Rose Medical Center, had another drug-theft scandal.

Last month, Allen received an additional year on his prison sentence for breaking a judge’s trust when he took a vacation with family while on his way to an Oregon prison to serve his sentence.

The Denver Post,"In a New Jersey city ravaged by heroin, a needle exchange stalls","By Anthony Izaguirre, The Associated Press

CAMDEN, N.J. — As she pressed down on the plunger of an empty syringe, a drop of blood oozed from the crooked tip of its needle — a test, Denise Brown said, that she uses on unpackaged syringes she now buys on the street.

She got in the routine after a program that allowed people who use heroin to get sterile injection equipment was shuttered more than a year ago.

The closure of the needle exchange in Camden, a struggling New Jersey city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, and a place where drugs are dealt openly on streets lined with abandoned storefronts and homes, has left many people there without a resource intended to stop the spread of blood-borne illnesses.

“They say they’re doing this to keep us safe, keep us clean. Then they take it away,” Brown, 41, said of the exchange program that she frequented for years during her nearly two decades of heroin addiction. “What does that say?”

And even with President Donald Trump declaring a public health emergency amid the national opioid crisis and Republican Gov. Chris Christie making addiction services a priority in his final year in office, the ending of the Camden program makes clear the tenuous position in which some of these services operate.

The city of about 74,000 needs to approve a permanent location for the health services van that once distributed the needles, but that decision has been held up in the office of outgoing Democratic Mayor Dana Redd, according to Martha Chavis, executive director of the Camden Area Health Education Center, which operated the program.

“I don’t get it,” said Chavis, noting positive dealings with the city from when the exchange started about a decade ago until private development forced them to shut down, although the van is still used to provide HIV tests, water and condoms.

“I’m just trying to get an answer,” Chavis said, calling Redd’s office the “roadblock” to why the program hasn’t given out a syringe since August 2016 and recently had to forfeit nearly $93,000 in state grant funding.

She said her team began trying to find a replacement location in 2015 after announcements that a campus for the energy company Holtec International would be built along the Delaware River in Camden. Holtec official Ed Mayer said it was unsafe to have the van on the property.

Vincent F. Basara, a spokesman for Redd, said officials haven’t agreed on a new place “that does not negatively impact our Camden residents or the quality of life in the surrounding area.”

For people who used to get sterile syringes from Chavis’ organization, it doesn’t make sense that a city with so many vacant properties and fatal heroin overdoses — health officials linked 115 deaths in Camden County to heroin in 2015, the highest in the state — is struggling to find a permanent space for the program.

“Put your child in our place,” said Joanna Greene, 31, who said she starting using heroin in 2008. “We’re sick. So who cares if we get sicker? Because you don’t even have a legitimate reason on why you took the needle exchange away.”

Nationally, the programs can be hampered by neighborhood pushback, shoestring budgets or bureaucratic hurdles, advocates said, but statistics show they are becoming more prevalent.

According to AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, there are 263 syringe programs in 37 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., roughly 60 more than in 2012.

Congress approved the use of federal funds toward the programs in 2015 but stipulated that the money can’t go toward buying syringes.

Twenty-six states, including New Jersey, and six select counties have been identified as experiencing or being at risk of significant increases in hepatitis infection or an HIV outbreak because of injection drug use after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a necessary step in using federal money for syringe programs.

The programs have been shown to decrease needle sharing. The CDC said in a report released last year that only about 1 in 10 people who used exchanges shared syringes, compared with more than 40 percent who didn’t use the programs. But it’s difficult to link them directly to decreased rates of blood-borne illnesses because data aren’t typically collected in controlled clinical trials.

In New Jersey, Christie has committed about $200 million to programs aimed at addiction prevention in his final year in office, including $2.1 million for syringe access programs in the state.

Christie has also signed legislation that would allow any municipality to operate a syringe access program and has approved a law authorizing syringe sales in pharmacies without prescriptions.

In Camden, Brown, with splotchy scars on her neck from injections with dulled needles, wondered why officials would allow such a long time to pass without allowing the exchange to operate.

“When people are desperate, they’ll pick needles up off the ground,” she said, her shaky hands lighting a cigarette. “They’re worried about AIDS and hepatitis C. This is one easy way to keep it down.”",31/10/2017
The Denver Post,Analysis: FEMA rejects appeals worth $1.2B over a decade,"As U.S. communities ravaged by this year’s series of intense hurricanes and wildfires clear debris and begin to rebuild, many are counting on the federal government to help cover their costs. They could be in for a frustrating surprise.

If history is any guide, some local governments and nonprofit organizations could get less than they were told to expect from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Others could be asked years from now to repay some or all of the aid they received, if FEMA concludes the projects failed to comply with its voluminous requirements or decides it shouldn’t have approved the payouts in the first place.

Over the past decade, FEMA’s denials and reversals have caused uncertainty and anger in some communities, led to long rounds of appeals, strained local budgets, made it hard for some organizations to stay afloat, and occasionally delayed the rebuilding process.

“My word of advice for everybody is document, document, document,” warned a frustrated Mayor Orlando Lopez of Sweetwater, Florida. “Cross your t’s, dot your i’s and back up everything.”

On Aug. 15, FEMA denied an appeal from the Miami suburb and said it must repay $2 million it received nearly two decades ago to repair storm damage because it failed to adequately document work done. Lopez called FEMA’s actions “completely and utterly unfair.” A few weeks after the denial, Sweetwater suffered a fresh round of damage from Hurricane Irma.

For its part, FEMA is legally obligated to look out for the taxpayers’ money and guard against misuse and fraud by local governments and organizations that overcharge the federal government or use emergency aid to undertake long-desired improvements they couldn’t otherwise afford.

Christopher Logan, FEMA’s public assistance director, said in the agency’s defense that major disasters can result in “extremely complex, technically complicated projects that span many, many years.” But he said the agency has recently taken steps to reduce what he called misunderstandings.

An analysis by The Associated Press found that over the past decade, FEMA headquarters has denied appeals for at least $1.2 billion sought by local governments and nonprofit groups to protect or rebuild communities hit by hurricanes, floods, fires, earthquakes, tornadoes or other major disasters.

The AP reviewed more than 900 final appeal rulings. In one-third of those cases, FEMA granted some or all of the requested funding, totaling about $250 million. Two-thirds of the appeals were rejected, probably totaling well more than the $1.2 billion tallied by the AP because the amounts denied were unclear in FEMA’s online records for more than 100 cases.

The money at stake in those cases was just a tiny fraction of the tens of billions of dollars FEMA paid out during that period. Yet the disputes may offer a glimpse of some of the challenges communities struck by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate could face in the years and even decades ahead.

The AP’s review found that FEMA has argued with local governments and nonprofits — and faced disagreements within its own ranks — over hundreds of matters big and small: whether buildings should be repaired or replaced; whether certain damage was caused by a disaster or by pre-existing problems; even whether tree stumps were the proper size to qualify for removal using federal aid.

Among the appeals squelched by FEMA: Florida’s attempt to get $51 million it claimed to have lost by waiving tolls for motorists evacuating from eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005.

FEMA’s final decisions sometimes come long after a disaster has struck, and even well after the money has been spent.

The agency also has repeatedly rejected funding requests based on the applicant’s failure to appeal within the required 60 days — even though FEMA acknowledges that it routinely exceeds its own 90-day legal deadline to rule on appeals.

FEMA’s Logan said the agency recently overhauled its disaster operations to provide each applicant with a single contact person and more information about the potential pitfalls in seeking federal aid.

The goal, he said, “is to help them understand what we can pay for and what we can’t pay for — so that we set the expectations up front so we don’t have those kind of misunderstandings.”

FEMA officials acknowledge the agency has done a poor job of resolving appeals quickly. In 2014, just 6 percent of appeals to FEMA headquarters were decided within the law’s 90-day requirement. That’s up to 26 percent this year, agency officials said.

Hurricane Katrina alone accounted for one out every seven appeals over the past decade. The storm illustrates how FEMA’s rulings can occasionally be financially devastating to groups and individuals and have long-lasting effects on communities.

“FEMA dropped us like a hot potato,” said Dimitre Blutcher of Harvey, Louisiana, former executive director of N’R Peace, a nonprofit organization that helps people with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases get medical treatment.

Her group’s HIV clinic and main office were devastated by flooding and winds from Katrina in 2005. Days after the storm, she said, FEMA asked her to continue providing services to clients. FEMA paid the group $105,600 for its work, which included the long process of reconstructing clients’ files after the paper records were destroyed.

Blutcher said FEMA and state officials led her to believe the clinic would qualify for additional money, so she took out a bank loan and line of credit while awaiting reimbursement for her costs, which grew to $280,000.

But FEMA reversed course in 2011, saying it would not provide any more reimbursement and ordering the group to repay the initial $105,600, too. The clinic soon closed its doors.

“They didn’t care that they promised us the money and we spent it. They didn’t care that I took out a line of credit to keep services going,” Blutcher said. “All they cared about was that people with HIV and other diseases got care, and then they refused to pay us several years later. How can any human do that?”

Rejecting the group’s final appeal in 2013, a FEMA administrator concluded that the cost of replacing destroyed medical files did not qualify for federal aid. The agency dismissed the group’s argument that it shouldn’t be punished for an error made by a lower-level FEMA official.

The Northridge earthquake shook Southern California in 1994, setting off a lengthy rebuilding process. Fifteen years later, FEMA headquarters was still deciding about a dozen appeals over funding. In some of those cases, FEMA was seeking to recoup millions of dollars that had been questioned after the fact by the agency’s auditors.

Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, about 35 miles north of Los Angeles, received $21.5 million from FEMA for repairs. But that fell far short of the roughly $35 million the hospital said it needed to fix the two-story facility in line with California’s new earthquake codes.

The 217-bed hospital eventually sought bankruptcy protection, blaming the underfunded project. Then in 2004, FEMA asked it to give back $2.1 million, saying the work exceeded the scope of the original agreement or lacked documentation justifying the costs.

The hospital went through the full two rounds of appeals, first at the FEMA regional office, then at FEMA headquarters, and lost. Hospital President and CEO Roger Seaver said it still hasn’t repaid FEMA.

“You’re struggling, you’re putting people on payment plans … getting new loans at high interest rates, paying the bankruptcy costs,” he said. “Then here comes the government back to help us again by taking back money.”",15/10/2017
The Denver Post,Highlights of the $330 billion-plus bill to avoid government shutdown,"WASHINGTON — It’s not just about President Donald Trump’s border wall.

The border security issues that sparked a 35-day government shutdown are but one element of a massive $330 billion-plus spending measure that wraps seven bills into one, funding nine Cabinet agencies, including the departments of Justice, State, Agriculture and Commerce. End-stage fights over unrelated policy provisions produced a deadlock, so efforts to extend soon-to-expire laws like the federal flood insurance program were dropped.

Highlights of the measure, which runs 1,768 pages of legislative text and explanation, include:

BORDER SECURITY, BUT NOT JUST BARRIERS

There’s nearly $1.4 billion for 55 miles of new barriers in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, well less than the $5.7 billion Trump wanted but only slightly below Trump’s original $1.6 billion request for 65 miles. There would be curbs on where construction could occur to protect environmentally sensitive areas.

The bill funds an average of 45,000-plus detention spaces for immigrants entering and living in the U.S. illegally, with flexibility to house even more. There’s more than $1 billion for other forms of border security, including improvements in surveillance equipment, hiring 600 additional customs officers, more immigration judges and $414 million in humanitarian aid for unauthorized immigrants who are detained.

A BILLION HERE, A BILLION THERE

Most of the bill deals with spending minutia such as a $1 billion increase to gear up for the 2020 census, an almost 4 percent budget increase for NASA and an $11.3 billion budget for the IRS. Most agencies are kept relatively level compared to last year, and the measure rejects big spending cuts — such as a $12 billion cut to foreign aid and the State Department — proposed by Trump.

It funds a new $435 million Homeland Security Department office to counter weapons of mass destruction, $550 million for rural broadband service, $468 million to combat the opioid epidemic above what was passed in legislation last year, $6 billion to combat HIV/AIDS overseas, and Israel’s annual $3.3 billion military aid package. There’s $3 billion to help state and local law enforcement, money for the Coast Guard’s first new icebreaker in four decades, increases for roads and mass transit, and money for clean air and water projects.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEE PAY

Trump has proposed a pay freeze for civilian federal employees, but the measure would guarantee those workers a 1.9 percent increase. The military got a 2.6 percent increase in legislation that passed Congress last year.

‘EXTENDERS’? NEVER MIND

Lawmakers in both parties eyed the measure to renew the government’s troubled federal flood insurance program through Sept. 30, but it and a full menu of expiring laws collectively known as “extenders” went unaddressed in the end. That meant a host of miscellaneous provisions were dropped in the final stages.

A drive by Senate Republicans to extend the Violence Against Women Act was blocked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who feared it would undercut efforts to update the law this spring.

Meanwhile, an extension of a Medicaid provision on home- and community-based nursing care, grants for the poor under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and fixes to a trust fund that finances dredging and maintenance or ports and harbors will also have to advance later.

A bid by Pelosi to win back pay for federal contractors laid off during the recent shutdown was blocked by the White House.

BIG TRUCKS

For fans of the truly obscure, there’s a provision to exempt sugar beet trucks in rural Oregon from length limits. It would also add exemptions to federal truck weight rules in the state of Kentucky.",14/02/2019
The Denver Post,Sex education: Colorado bill would ban abstinence-only approach,"A contentious bill that would block Colorado’s public schools from teaching abstinence-only sex education is scheduled for its first hearing at the Capitol on Wednesday.

Most public schools have taught “comprehensive” sex education since a law passed in 2013, but some charter and rural schools opted out. If HB19-1032 passes, those schools would have to use the new curriculum as outlined in the bill or teach nothing at all.

The House health and insurance committee hearing will be held at 1:30 p.m. in room 0107 of the Capitol.

What the bill says

Classes would have to include “medically accurate information about all preventive methods to avoid unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS” and be taught in a way that students are “empowered to decide for themselves which preventative methods are best suited for their individuals needs, beliefs and values.”

Public schools would be prohibited from endorsing “sexual abstinence as the primary or sole acceptable preventive method available to students. Such instruction is not comprehensive and is inconsistent with the requirements of this section.”

Teachers wouldn’t have to talk about pregnancy, but if they do it says they can’t exclude options like adoption or abortion, and they can’t show a preference for one choice over another.

Lessons about human sexuality could not “explicitly or implicitly” endorse a particular religious ideology.

Lessons also couldn’t use “shame-based or stigmatizing language or instructional tools” or exclude “the relational or sexual experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender individuals.”

Parents would have to be notified about human sexuality classes and given the option to remove their children, but they wouldn’t have to be notified about lesson plans on sexual orientation and healthy relationships.

The curriculum would have to include lessons about healthy relationships, how to recognize emotional abuse, how to communicate consent and the withdrawal of consent.

Opposition forming

The bill is drawing an outcry from some conservative and religious groups.

The Colorado Catholic Conference worries the new requirements would present human sexuality in a way that stigmatizes Catholic beliefs, according to a Catholic News Agency interview with the conference’s executive director.

Jennifer Kraska told the agency she worries that the language of the bill says “people or families with certain beliefs and teachings about sex, relationships and gender (like those of the Catholic Church) are basically wrong in their beliefs and teachings.”

And Colorado GOP Chairman Jeff Hays characterized the bill in a bulletin as a “radical sex ed” bill that would “require sex-ed curriculum in Colorado public schools to conform to radical notions of sexuality and gender, while allowing classes to cover these topics without parents being notified.”

What supporters say

The bill’s three authors, two Democrats and one Republican, included a 2017 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey at the top of their bill. It showed 9.6 percent of female students and 18.5 percent of lesbian, gay or bisexual youth reported being physically forced into sexual relations against their will.

“These statistics reflect a dire need for all Colorado youth to have access to comprehensive human sexuality education that teaches consent, hallmarks of safe and healthy relationships, self-acceptance, and respect for others,” according to the bill.",29/01/2019
The Denver Post,Colorado State professor weighs in on how a scientist says he made a gene-edited baby,"(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)

By George Seidel, Colorado State University

On Nov. 28, He Jiankui claimed to a packed conference room at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong to have edited the genomes of two twin girls, Lulu and Nana, who were born in China.

Scientists at Southern University of Science and Technology in Guangdong, China, condemned He’s research asserting he “has seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct,” and philosophers and bioethicists were quick dive into the morass of editing human genomes. So I’m not going to cover that territory. What I want to address is what we learned: how He made these babies.

I am theoretically a retired professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. For more than 50 years, I have researched numerous aspects of assisted reproductive technology including cloning and making genetic changes to mammalian embryos, so I am interested in most any research concerning “designer babies” and the health problems they may suffer.

A first?

At the conference He gave a general overview of the science. While research like this would typically be presented to the scientific community by publishing in a peer-reviewed journal, which he claims that he intends to do, we can get a rough sense of how he created these modified babies. This is something that has been successfully done in other species and just last year in human embryos – but the latter were not implanted into a woman. He says he spent three years testing the procedure on mice and monkeys before he moved to working on human embryos.

There is no doubt that precise genetic modifications can be made to human sperm, eggs, embryos and even some cells in adults. Such modifications have been done ad nauseum in mice, pigs and several other mammals. Thus, it is obvious to scientists like myself that these same genetic modifications can, and will, be made in humans. The easiest way to make genetic changes begins with the embryo.

The toolbox

The trendiest strategy to modify DNA these days involves the CRISPR/Cas-9 gene editing tool, which can make precise genetic modifications in living cells. Although other tools have been available for years, the CRISPR/Cas-9 approach is simpler, easier, more accurate and less expensive.

The way it works is simple in concept. The Cas-9 component is a molecular scissors that cuts the DNA at the location specified by a small piece of DNA called the “CRISPR template.” Once the DNA is cut, a gene can be modified at that location. The cut is then repaired by enzymes already present in cells.

In this case, He targeted a gene which produces a protein on the surface of cells called CCR5. The HIV virus uses this protein to attach to and infect the cell. He’s idea was to genetically change CCR5 so that HIV can no longer infect cells, making the girls resistant to the virus.

At this point He has not provided a clear explanation of exactly how he disabled the CCR5 and the nature of the genetic modification. But this kind of “disabling” is routinely used in research.

How he did it

From the diagram He presented, it appears that He injected the CRISPR/Cas-9 system into an egg at the same time as he injected a sperm to fertilize it. After this, the egg divided and formed a ball of dozens of cells – the embryo. At this stage, He removed a few cells from each embryo to determine if the desired genetic change was made. Based on my experience, the embryos were probably frozen at this point. When the analysis was complete, He probably thawed the modified embryos and transferred the best ones back into the mother’s uterus for gestation to term. Embryos without the edits or incorrect edits would either be discarded or used for research.

For many applications, it is ideal to make any changes to the genes at the one-cell stage. Then, when the embryo duplicates its DNA and divides to make a two-cell embryo, the genetic modification is also duplicated. This continues so that every cell in the resulting baby has the genetic change.

However, it appears that the genetic modification in this case did not occur until the two-cell stage or later, because some cells in the babies had the modification, while others did not. This situation is called mosaicism because the child is a mosaic of normal and edited cells.

Hazards of embryo editing?

What could go wrong in a gene-edited embryo? Plenty.

The first glitch is that no modification was made, which occurs frequently. A variation is that the change occurs in some cells of the embryo, but not in all the cells, as occurred in these babies.

The most common worry is so-called non-target effects, in which the genetic modification is made, but other unintended edit(s) occur in other locations in the genome. Having a modification at the wrong place can cause all kinds of developmental problems, such as abnormal organ development, miscarriage and even cancers.

From his slide it appears that He sequenced the genomes – the complete genetic blueprint for each child – at multiple stages of the pregnancy to determine whether there were any undesirable modifications, though these aren’t always easy to find. But until independent scientists can examine the DNA of these two baby girls, we won’t know the results. It is also not clear from the results He has shared so far whether this genetic change can be transmitted to the next generation.

Another common problem already alluded to is mosaicism, which appears to have happened in one of these twins. If some cells are edited, and some not, the baby might have liver cells that contain the edited gene and heart cells that have the normal version, for instance. This may or may not lead to serious issues.

Another issue is that manipulating embryos in vitro – outside their normal environment in the reproductive tract – where we can’t precisely duplicate the normal nutrition, oxygen levels, hormones and growth factors – could lead to developmental abnormalities including oversize fetuses, metabolic problems, and so on. This sometimes occurs with routine procedures such as in vitro fertilization when there is no attempt to make genetic modifications.

Fortunately, nature is quite good at weeding out abnormal embryos via embryonic death and spontaneous abortion. Even in healthy human populations reproducing normally, nearly half of embryos die before the woman even knows that she was pregnant.

We already design babies – and there are benefits

While I have emphasized what can go wrong, I believe that the science will evolve such that genetically modified babies will be healthier than unmodified ones. And these improvements will be passed on to future generations. Severely debilitating genetic abnormalities such as Tay-Sachs syndrome could be removed from a family by genetic modification.

Arguably, designer babies are already being born using a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnoses (PGD). A few cells from embryos are screened for dozens, and potentially hundreds, of genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs syndrome, to name a few. Parents are also able to choose those embryos of the desired sex. In my view, choosing which embryos to implant is clearly making designer babies.

Going a step further, PGD isn’t restricted to just eliminating disease. A prospective parent can also choose other traits. When one of the prospective parents in infertile, there are catalogs that provide the race, height and weight, and even the educational level of a sperm or egg donor, who is also determined to be free of major genetic defects, and free of AIDS and other venereal diseases.

In my opinion, if the procedures are deemed ethically and morally acceptable, most genetic modifications likely to be made editing embryos as He says he has done, will involve removal of harmful traits rather than adding desirable ones. Because the changes will be targeted, they will be more precise and less harmful than the mutations that occur randomly in DNA of essentially all sperm and eggs naturally.

With all of this reproductive technology, there is one other consideration: the huge costs of the procedures described. To what extent should society invest scarce medical resources in applying such techniques, especially since any benefits likely will accrue mostly to wealthier families?

These perspectives need to be kept in mind when evaluating potential genetic manipulations of humans.

The Denver Post,Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman: A conservative advocate for LGBT,"By Peter Marcus, Colorado Politics

DENVER — Colorado Republican Attorney General Cynthia Coffman’s office staff knows that when Jesse Wright phones, his call should be put right through.

“I have tried real hard to limit that so that I don’t interrupt whatever is going on for her,” said Coffman’s friend, Wright, a gay man who has been battling HIV for nearly 25 years.

Sometimes confused for the powerful attorney general’s brother, Wright has been under the part-time care of Coffman for 15 years — something that few would expect of a busy elected official who has been labeled a conservative for pushing court battles that have included blocking implementation of federal carbon-pollution standards, federal fracking regulations and clean water rules.

With Coffman seriously considering a run for governor — something that requires surviving a divisive primary — it seems surprising that she would so publicly advocate for gay rights. But that is just what Coffman has been doing, inspired by friends such as Wright and others.

“Certainly there are fewer voices of Republicans in the political debate when it comes to equality and gay rights, and I find it somewhat perplexing because Republicans are about personal responsibility and individual rights,” Coffman told Colorado Politics in a recent interview.

She received cheers and applause for an emotional speech following the 2016 attack at Orlando’s Pulse gay nightclub, where 49 people were massacred in the worse mass shooting in U.S. history. She abandoned prepared remarks to speak directly to Colorado’s gay community.

“You are here for each other, and we are all here for you,” Coffman said at the time.

Recently she stood on the steps of the Colorado Capitol surrounded by Democrats and told the crowd that she could be the only Republican attorney general in the country taking part in an LGBT pride event.

“I’m going to be challenging all of my colleagues to do this, because there’s no reason why we all shouldn’t be out here,” Coffman said at the rally at the state Capitol after marching in the annual PrideFest Parade.

HISTORY OF LGBT ADVOCACY

Years before Coffman would meet Wright, she began her LGBT advocacy work in Atlanta, where she was an aspiring attorney. It was the late-1980s, and AIDS was an epidemic that stirred broad fear and anxiety. Not much was understood about the communicable disease as the death toll — particularly in cities like San Francisco, Chicago and New York — skyrocketed.

Atlanta, with its large gay population, was impacted more than many other communities. During law school at Georgia State University, Coffman lived downtown in the heart of “Hotlanta.”

In 1989, a young Coffman volunteered for a nonprofit called Open Hand, which is similar to Project Angel Heart in Denver, both of which deliver nutritious meals to people with chronic illnesses. At the time, AIDS was front and center.

“I wanted to volunteer with that group because I felt that people who were suffering from the disease were being ostracized and it was important to me . to be part of serving that population when other people were looking and going in the other direction,” Coffman said.

In high school in Lebanon, Missouri, Coffman had friends who were gay. By the time she graduated in 1979, one friend had committed suicide, and another had attempted suicide because they were unable to grapple with social stigmas attached to being gay. These friends couldn’t even find acceptance among their own families.

“We still have kids committing suicide for this reason, and as long as that is going on, we have a lot of work to do,” Coffman said.

She found herself inspired by the stories of her gay friends while working in Georgia for the state department of health. At the time, the department was conducting rule-making around HIV/AIDS. Some proposed collecting the names of people who tested positive for the virus.

“It reinforced for me that as a society we were discriminating against a class of people based on a disease that we didn’t understand,” Coffman recalled. “It gave me more appreciation for what people who were homosexual were facing, whether they had HIV or AIDS or not. People made an assumption that they were a leper, that they had the disease.”

MEETING JESSE — A LASTING FRIENDSHIP

In 1999, two years after Coffman moved to Colorado, Coffman started volunteering at Project Angel Heart. About three years in, in 2002, Coffman became close with an HIV-positive man who lived by himself, as his partner had died of AIDS. That man was Jesse Wright.

Stricken by pneumonia — which was exacerbated by smoke from the massive, then-burning Hayman Fire — Wright was hospitalized. Coffman began having conversations with Wright and caring for him, which caused Project Angel Heart to ask her to make a decision. Coffman had to choose between the nonprofit and caring for Wright, as Project Angel Heart’s policy was not to get personally involved with individual clients.

She chose Wright.

Whether it’s taking him to doctor’s appointments, making sure that he properly takes his medication, delivering diabetic Popsicles (which Wright hates but tolerates), or simply offering him comfort, Coffman has never abandoned her friend, keeping in contact with him at least every other day.

“We are a big part of each other’s life and support,” Coffman said. “That’s had a lot to do with how I’ve looked at gay rights issues since then, because of Jesse, the people I’ve met through him and the experiences I’ve seen so up close and personal.”

Wright agrees completely: “I wanted to tell everybody she was my sister,” he said. “I can talk to her about anything, and I mean anything. Things that most people would feel uncomfortable about, I talk to her about them.”

And Coffman talks right back. With her recent divorce from U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Aurora, Cynthia Coffman has felt the pressure of her personal life being in the spotlight, an uncomfortable reality of being a public figure. But Wright has offered her an outlet.

“I would call it grounding for me and I’m lucky,” she said. “It just broadens my perspective, but it also reminds me that politics and public office is a small sliver of life for most people, and it should be put in perspective. I’ll be a better leader if I do that.”

Wright experienced many of the hardships that Coffman’s gay friends from high school went through. Now 57, he says he hasn’t had much family in his life since he was 17, when he left Kansas and was granted custody over himself. His father was intolerant of him being gay.

“He went through many of the things my friend who committed suicide did,” Coffman said. “They wanted to believe that when they found out that he was gay that they could change him and that he could decide not to be gay.”

In the Colorado legislature, Republicans have repeatedly opposed legislation that would have prohibited the practice of gay conversion therapy, in which counselors attempt to turn people from being gay.

“When we talk about conversion therapy, I get my hackles raised,” Coffman said. “Trying to use therapy to make someone into something they’re not is a dangerous practice.”

Coffman has become so committed to Wright that she at times gets angry if he goes to a doctor’s appointment without her. When they first met she paid off his parking tickets. Soon she would help him with his bills. When Wright moved about two years ago, Coffman purchased furniture for his apartment.

Early in their friendship, when Wright spent 45 days in the hospital for pancreatitis, Coffman stayed with him in the hospital nearly every day. Wright wasn’t aware that she was in the room, but when he began feeling better, hospital staff informed him of Coffman’s presence.

“They told her every day that I was going to die,” Wright said. “When I first met Cynthia and she was being so kind and everything, I told her, ‘Don’t get too attached because I’m probably not going to live any more than a couple of years..’ But I have bounced back every time.”

Wright was lucky enough to survive the days when HIV/AIDS was considered a death sentence. He lived long enough to benefit from drugs that have kept him alive, while many of his friends with the disease have passed away over the years.

“From then on, she was willing to go to every doctor’s appointment because I made a big boo-boo, what I thought I heard wasn’t what I heard, and she heard it the right way, so I asked her if she minded coming with me . so she started coming with me to all my doctor’s appointments.”

Wright started taking opioids for the pain associated with his illness, and while he has been responsible with his dosing, his experience inspired Coffman to focus on the opioid epidemic facing the state and the nation. She makes sure that he is receiving proper medical advice on the subject.

UPHILL BATTLE FOR A REPUBLICAN

While Coffman has been somewhat comfortable putting herself out there as a Republican on the subject of gay rights, it is not always perceived as a safe place to be for a conservative.

Margaret Hoover, president of American Unity Fund, a Republican group that pushes conservatives to advance LGBT issues, said that in the years it was fighting for marriage equality, more than 230 Republican lawmakers in state legislatures across the country voted for marriage equality, while only two lost their seats for it.

Still, perception is holding back the party from fully embracing LGBT issues, with much of the religious right of the GOP using organized political networks in an attempt to block support.

“Some of the bills that would be pretty harmful to LGBT individuals are happening in red states with red legislatures and red executives, and often it’s a governor who we work with closely and who decides that that bill is not right for his state,” said Hoover, a Colorado native who lives in New York and worked in the George W. Bush administration.

“What we found is there are some legislators who are there in their heart, but they’re afraid to be there politically,” Hoover said. “Cynthia is like this shining example of somebody who has the courage of her political convictions. Her political convictions match her moral convictions.”

She added that there has been a “backlash” within the GOP since efforts to advance marriage equality succeeded.

“What we’re actually doing is fighting skirmishes that are really seeded in backlash on same-sex marriage from a politically motivated religious right,” Hoover said. “The landscape can look dim, but if you look granularly at it . if you squint, you can see real signs of hope.”

While much of the country has moved beyond opposing same-sex marriage and LGBT rights, many in the GOP have been scared to embrace progressive positions. Though the national GOP has come to largely ignore the subject, it also has not taken a strong stance.

One Colorado, a left-leaning LGBT group, believes Coffman can lead the way for other Republicans to advance gay rights issues.

“We’ve seen for years that support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer Coloradans and their families is not a partisan issue,” said Daniel Ramos, executive director of One Colorado. “In the fight for LGBTQ equality, we believe Attorney General Coffman’s support for LGBTQ Coloradans and their families serves as an example to other Republicans.”

Her friend Wright jokes that he doesn’t always agree with Coffman when it comes to Republican issues, despite their close relationship.

“We’ve had our talks about it,” Wright laughed. “I mean, it took Reagan so long to talk about gay issues, and they (Republicans) find him as their savior to save all, and he did nothing for nobody .. But I’ll vote Republican if she feels real strong about it.”

Coffman said she is not bothered by any backlash she might receive for being a member of the GOP and a strong advocate for LGBT issues.

“People will only come along if they see other people out there doing what I’m doing,” she said.

“Just as with abortion, some people’s opinions about gay rights and homosexuality are based in a biblical belief and a religious philosophy .. But I feel like I’m standing up for my friends, as well as for people I don’t know and haven’t met but I know are out there, that’s what being a representative of the people means .. I think being a leader can be uncomfortable sometimes.”",12/08/2017
The Denver Post,"Hepatitis C in Denver is booming, but a pill that tells doctors whether you’ve taken it could change that","As cases of hepatitis C boom across Colorado and doctors work furiously to guide patients from diagnosis to cure, there is one challenge that can be surprisingly difficult. Patients have to take their medicine.

So now, as part of three ambitious studies that could radically improve the detection of hepatitis C and care for people who have it, researchers at Denver Health are trying something futuristic: a pill that will tell doctors whether a patient took it.

The pill, basically a gelcap, contains hepatitis C medicine and a microscopically small sensor that, when it hits the stomach, beams out a signal. (The sensor then dissolves harmlessly.) The signal gets picked up by a patch worn on the skin, and that patch syncs with an iPad that uses mobile networks to upload the information to the internet, where a doctor can see which patients haven’t taken their pills that day and give them a call to remind them.

Dr. David Wyles, the head of the hospital’s infectious disease division, said the pill will allow doctors to track better than ever how well people stick to a course of medication. But they also may discover vital new information about treating hepatitis C, a viral disease that impacts the liver and can be fatal but is also curable through often expensive medicines.

“We really don’t know how often you need to take your hepatitis C medication to be cured,” Wyles said.

This study — along with two others at Denver Health — comes at a time when hepatitis C cases are rising across Colorado.

The state Health Department typically logs 3,000 to 4,000 new cases of chronic hepatitis C a year. But that annual figure has been trending upward since 2011, and 2016 saw nearly 5,000 newly reported cases of chronic hepatitis C. The Health Department also estimates that, for every case it hears about, there are nearly 13 others it doesn’t.

Injection drug use is the most common risk factor seen in younger patients who are newly diagnosed, and the rise in hep C diagnoses is likely partly a result of the heroin epidemic. But baby boomers are the age group with the most reported hep C cases — a legacy of an era when blood transfusions weren’t as rigorously screened — and the virus can churn along in the body for decades without showing symptoms.

“Unfortunately, it’s just really hard to detect until it’s really serious,” said Dr. Sarah Rowan, the associate director of HIV and viral hepatitis prevention at Denver Public Health.

That leads Denver Health doctors to suspect that hep C might be even more common than believed. To test the hypothesis, they are about to launch a study that will include everyone who comes into the emergency room as a potential test subject.

The study will divide patients into two groups. One group will be asked the typical questions to determine if they are at higher risk for hep C and then offered a test if they are. In the other group, everyone will be offered a test — regardless of risk factors. Dr. Jason Haukoos, a Denver Health emergency medicine specialist who is helping to lead the study, said the results could show whether a hep C test should be just a standard part of care for everyone.

Those diagnosed with hep C could be entered into another study at Denver Health. That one will use specially trained “navigators” to help patients, who may be homeless or struggling with drug addiction, better connect with treatment.

All together, the three studies represent a massive effort by the city’s safety-net hospital to tackle the hep C boom before it becomes a full explosion. But Rowan said the benefit to Denver — including its most marginalized residents — will be worth it.

The Denver Post,"Two Colorado nurses jailed for stealing drugs had hopped from hospital to hospital, losing jobs for similar behavior","Two Colorado nurses who repeatedly put patients at risk by stealing powerful painkillers from the hospitals where they worked had already lost jobs at other health-care facilities for similar behavior, court documents show.

It is the latest in a string of cases in which medical professionals in Colorado hopped from hospital to hospital without their drug problems being identified.

U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson recently sentenced the nurses in separate cases to prison terms after federal prosecutors argued that their drug thefts endangered vulnerable patients.

Jackson on Friday sentenced Lisa Marie Jones, 43, to 14 months in prison after she pleaded guilty to stealing fentanyl, morphine and hydromorphone from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Denver and UCHealth in Aurora in 2016 and 2017. On April 20, Jackson sentenced Marlene Gilmore, 28, to four months in prison after she pleaded guilty to stealing those drugs from North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley in 2016.

Their cases follow the 2016 prosecution of Rocky Allen, an HIV-infected surgical technician who prompted a multistate health scare for similar thefts at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood. Allen’s case prompted significant debate in Colorado over whether hospitals were doing enough to protect patients from drug-addicted health care personnel. A Denver Post investigation found numerous similar cases that highlighted problems both with hospital background checks and the state’s regulatory system.

Jones drew concern while working at a UCHealth six-bed emergency department facility in Aurora when a pharmacist in February 2017 determined a vial of fentanyl had been tampered with, according to court documents. She earlier had been flagged for high use of fentanyl at UCHealth, where she had begun working in November 2016. A sample of her hair tested positive for fentanyl and morphine even though she did not have a prescription for their use.

Despite that positive drug test, Jones was able to secure work as a contract nurse at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Denver from March 10, 2017, through April 27, 2017, her plea agreement states. The VA, where she had worked earlier in 2016, was not aware of her firing from UCHealth, court documents state. At the VA, she stole for her own use hydromorphone from vials intended for patients. She refilled those syringes with saline.

Jones was investigated by the Colorado State Nursing Board, which reinstated her nursing license in August after she agreed to participate in a monitoring and drug treatment program, her plea agreement states.

Jones had sought leniency from the judge, saying she suffered trauma due to being raped by a neighbor when she was 12. She added that she first became addicted to painkillers that were prescribed to help her recovery from dental surgeries. Jones also claimed that adding to her stress were the needs of her 14-year-old son, who struggles with a cleft lip and palate.

Federal prosecutors said Jones should not be shown leniency because her multiple thefts involved tampering with the vials that contained the painkillers. She would take those vials into a bathroom, where she then diverted painkillers from the vials for her own use. She then would refill the vials with saline and reseal the vials with skin glue, according to court filings. That tampering put patients at risk of not receiving adequate pain relief because their drugs had been diluted, and also at risk of being contaminated with infectious diseases, the prosecutors said in court filings.

“It is the risk to medically compromised individuals and the disregard for their well-being that places a tampering charge in a different realm than a simple theft charge,” government prosecutors said in court filings.

In the case of Gilmore, similar past indiscretions involving drug thefts did not bring an end to her medical career. Court documents show that Gilmore in 2014 resigned from the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, where she worked as a nurse in the cardiac unit, after authorities there confronted her about her diversion of drugs from the hospital. Multiple employees reported to hospital managers that she was slurring her speech, falling over in her chair and nodding off. One hospital employee also reported finding a bloody syringe and blood drops in a bathroom Gilmore had used.

Despite that resignation, Gilmore found work in 2015 at North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley in the critical care unit, where she stole fentanyl, morphine and hydromorphone, according to her guilty plea. She tried to cover up her crimes by refilling those drug containers with tap water, court documents state. At least four times, tests determined the drug containers were contaminated with bacteria or fungi, according to documents.

In court filings, prosecutors alleged she stole the drugs at least 132 times. “Though there are no reported instances of actual patient injury, the risk was very real and the defendant’s disregard for the safety of others is apparent through her conduct,” prosecutors said in the filing.",01/05/2018
The Denver Post,"Colorado Health Department confirms surgical infections at Porter, but link to sterilization flaws unclear","The head of Colorado’s Health Department announced Wednesday that officials have confirmed surgical infections in “a number of patients” at a Denver hospital at the center of an investigation into sterilization practices.

The infections occurred between July 21, 2016, and April 5 in patients who had orthopedic or spine surgery at Porter Adventist Hospital. The hospital suspended all surgeries after officials at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found problems with how the hospital was cleaning its instruments after surgeries. CDPHE also raised concerns about residue on the tools after they were cleaned — which Porter attributed to a possible water-quality problem, according to a CDPHE statement Wednesday.

In that statement, Dr. Larry Wolk, CDPHE’s executive director, said Porter has made several changes requested by state officials and that it would resume surgeries “on a limited schedule” on Thursday. His statement did not specify how many patients were found to have suffered surgical infections during the time period or what the infections were.

“It is unknown if these infections are linked to the breach, and we may not be able to determine linkage,” Wolk said.

When CDPHE announced the breach, it said patients could potentially have been at low risk of contracting hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

Porter is one of the state’s busiest hospitals for orthopedic surgeries. According to state data, surgeons at Porter performed more than 2,000 hip or knee replacements between August 2015 and July 2016, the most recent period for which numbers are available. There were eight infections associated with those surgeries, according to CDPHE.

Neither state nor hospital officials have said how many surgeries were performed during the 2016-18 period of concern for infections.

The health department, which was told of the breach Feb. 21, conducted an on-site survey of infection-control practices at Porter the next day. A disease-control investigation is ongoing.

Patients notified by the hospital are receiving a list of frequently asked questions.

The letter explains that the sterilization issue revolved around the first step in a multistep process. The first step is a pre-cleaning process that happens before instruments go through “an intense heat sterilization,” the letter says.

“Although extremely low, there is a risk of surgical site infection or bloodborne pathogen transmission,” the letter reads. “In the rare event that a patient tests positive for a bloodborne pathogen, there are many treatment options available. Your health care provider will discuss these with you in the unlikely event you receive a positive test result.”

The letter explains that a surgical site infection tends to present itself within 30 days of surgery, but in a very limited number of cases, symptoms might occur up to a year later if the surgery involved placement of a prosthetic limb.

The Denver Post,Gates: Foundation to invest $5B in Africa over next 5 years,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said Sunday his foundation will invest another $5 billion in Africa over the next five years.

Gates delivered the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture ahead of Mandela Day, when South Africans are encouraged to donate 67 minutes of their time to help others.

Gates is also in South Africa to attend a global AIDS conference that starts Monday.

Gates said the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has already invested more than $9 billion in Africa. Health is a major focus.

Gates warned that if the world doesn’t come up with more creative ways to make HIV treatment and prevention accessible, “the hard-earned gains made against HIV in sub-Saharan Africa over the last 15 years could actually be reversed” as high birth rates continue.

He said Africa is the world’s youngest continent in terms of demographics. “By 2050, 40 percent of the world’s children will live on this continent,” he said.

Still, he said Africa had made notable progress in fighting AIDS, saying that the last time South Africa hosted the global conference 16 years ago, only a few thousand Africans were on HIV drugs. At the time, the drugs were too expensive for many in the region hardest hit by the epidemic.

South Africa now says half of its infected population of 6.8 million people is on treatment.

Gates noted that Mandela fought stigma by announcing publicly the death of his son from AIDS in 2005.

Gates’ speech focused largely on youth and on how to achieve ambitious global development goals endorsed by countries last year.

In the only sharp words of his address, he said: “I get angry when I see that Africa is suffering the worst effects of climate change, although Africans had almost nothing to do with causing it.”",17/07/2016
The Denver Post,U.S. stocks mixed amid fallout from Tropical Storm Harvey,"By Marley Jay, The Associated Press

U.S. stocks finished little changed on Monday as investors focused on the effects of Tropical Storm Harvey. Insurance companies and oil drillers stumbled, while refineries rose along with gasoline prices.

With August coming to a close, Monday was one of the quietest days of the year on Wall Street. Biotech drug companies rose after hepatitis C and HIV drug maker Gilead Sciences agreed to buy cancer drug maker Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Travel booking website Expedia tumbled as investors expected the company’s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, to leave to become CEO of ride-sharing company Uber.

Lacking other major corporate or economic news, investors mostly focused on Harvey, which continues to hit parts of the Gulf Coast with historically heavy rains. Large parts of the energy and petrochemical industries are based there, and companies with a lot of stores in the area stand to lose business. While gas-price spikes will be temporary, other effects of the storm will last for years.

“There will be ripple effects that everyone is going to feel,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Capital Markets. He said that could include higher insurance premiums, as the storm is likely to cause tens of billions of dollars in flood damage. Ablin added that the storm might affect interest rates as well, as the Federal Reserve might hesitate to raise rates if it’s believed that the storm will slow the economy significantly.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 1.19 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,444.24. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 5.27 points to 21,808.40. The Nasdaq composite rose 17.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,283.02. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 4.78 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,382.23. Most of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell.

Insurance companies declined as investors worried that flooding from Harvey will lead to big losses. Travelers slumped $3.24, or 2.6 percent, to $123.23, and Progressive shed $1.09, or 2.3 percent, to $47.31. Some companies that could play a role in cleanup efforts after the storm traded higher.

Those included environmental services company Clean Harbors, which rose $1.59, or 3.1 percent, to $52.98. Gilead Sciences agreed to buy Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion, or $180 a share. Kite Pharma stock jumped $38.95, or 28 percent, to $178.05, and Gilead gained 90 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.69.

The Denver Post,Accused Aurora child sex trafficker back in jail after allegedly paying to house juveniles,"An Aurora man charged with trafficking underage boys for sex is back in jail and prosecutors say he violated terms of his bond by hanging out with juveniles, and housing two 17-year-olds and a pair of men in a Westminster hotel.

Sean Crumpler, 50, is charged with 21 counts, including sex trafficking, sexual servitude and sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust. Crumpler also is charged with one count of a sexual offense with notice of HIV and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He had been free on $100,000 bond.

Crumpler was arrested again on Jan. 6, after the FBI’s Lost Innocence Task Force said he had established relationships and paid for lodging for minor boys.

On Tuesday, an 18th Judicial District judge raised Crumpler’s bond to $500,000.

The charges Crumpler faces arose after a dozen boys and men ranging from 16 to 21 were found living with him in 2015. He allegedly housed, fed, and provided them with drugs, alcohol and iPhones and other items in exchange for sex with him and others.

A 21-year-old man who lived at the home told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” The man also said Crumpler was HIV-positive and had unprotected sex with those living in the house.

His original bond conditions included a requirement that he have no contact with anyone under 18 years of age.

On Jan. 5, members of the FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force went to the Cottonwood Suites, in Westminster to arrest Coddie Favela, 21, and Ricardo Barron, 20, who were wanted on human trafficking charges.

When officers entered room 223, they found both men and two boys, all of whom were completely naked. “There were several items of clothing, uneaten food, trash, unopened condoms, female wigs and makeup all over the room,” according to a court document.

In a police report, an investigator said that he learned that “Crumpler had rented the room for all of the males in the room.”

One of the boys said that he had stayed at Crumpler’s home “until Favela and Barron got to Colorado, at which point they were soon put into the hotel room, until they could get an apartment.”

Crumpler talked to one of the boys about his upcoming trial, saying “he has been wanting to cherish what he has now, and (stating) he could be going to jail for life, or may get out in 12 years on appeal.”

Crumpler, the owner of a Long Beach, Calif., information technology firm that claims to specialize in helping primary care physicians operate their practices, was booked into the Arapahoe County Jail after his Jan. 6 arrest. His trial on the original charges is set for April.",17/01/2017
The Denver Post,Barring gay blood donors doesn’t make sense,"The Orlando shootings have highlighted outdated federal policy regarding blood donations that is a holdover from the HIV scare of the 1980s.

Food and Drug Administration guidelines bar men who have had sex with men in the past year from donating blood. Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, who himself is gay, explains that the most absurd consequence of this policy in Orlando has been that “quite literally a spouse of a victim can’t donate to help their own spouse.”

The Boulder Democrat argues that sensible screening criteria should be behavior based, with the main concerns being intravenous drugs and unprotected sex.

Gay men still account for a disproportionate percentage of HIV cases, but the difference between the 1980s and today is the testing technology used on all donated blood. On a recent report on “PBS NewsHour,” for example, Dr. Paul Volberding, director of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, said, “The testing methods [for blood-borne diseases such as HIV] are just amazingly accurate. We don’t miss infected people. The window from the exposure to testing positive is as short as a few days.”

Volberding is one of a number of experts who believe FDA policy is “not really supported by the facts.”

Until last December, the FDA had imposed a blanket ban on any gay or bisexual man donating blood who’d ever had sex with another male — a policy that had been in place for more than 30 years. But under pressure from the American Medical Association, American Red Cross and other groups, the FDA updated the policy to allow abstinent gays to donate blood, too.

That’s progress, for sure. But it still needlessly excludes a large number of gay men — including, as Polis notes, those in married monogamous relationships.

The Denver Post,"Martin Shkreli could be forced to give up exclusive Wu-Tang Clan album, Picasso after criminal conviction","Federal prosecutors said Friday that Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund manager notorious for raising the price of a critical drug, should forfeit more than $7 million in assets after being convicted of lying to investors.

Shkreli should turn over two rap albums – the only known copy of the Wu-Tang Clan’s “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” and Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter IV” – as well as $5 million in cash, interest in a company he started, Touring Pharmaceutical, and a Picasso painting, prosecutors said. They also asked that he give up a World War II-era Enigma code-breaking machine used against Nazi Germany.

Shkreli is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, while awaiting sentencing. The prosecutors’ request did not address how much time they believe he should serve. The most serious changes can lead to up to 20 years in prison.

The forfeiture of $7,360,450 “represents a conservative computation of the proceeds Shkreli personally obtained as a result of his three different securities fraud crimes of conviction,” Bridget M. Rohde, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a court filing Friday.

Shkreli’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shkreli was convicted this summer of misleading investors in two of his hedge funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He lied to get their money and then to cover up massive losses after he made a bad stock bet, according to prosecutors. Shkreli disputed the charges and attempted to sway the jury with a simple rebuttal: His investors were wealthy and sophisticated and he ultimately made them richer.

The former hedge fund manager’s infamy hung over the case, beginning with jury selection when the judge struggled to find potential jurors who didn’t already dislike him. He is best known for raising the price of Daraprim – a 62-year-old drug primarily used to treat newborns and HIV patients – from $13.50 to $750 a pill. Shkreli faced a flurry of criticism of the move, but instead of shrinking from the spotlight, he often battled his critics online and gained the nickname “Pharma Bro” for his antics.

Even after being convicted, Shkreli struggled to repress his quirky instincts and to stay off social media. In September, a federal judge revoked his bail after prosecutors complained that his out-of-court antics posed a danger to the community. Shkreli harassed women online, prosecutors argued, and even offered his Facebook followers $5,000 to grab a strand of Hillary Clinton’s hair during her book tour.",01/12/2017
The Denver Post,Colorado lifts restrictions for treating hepatitis C patients; no longer need to have advanced liver damage to receive drugs,"Colorado soon will begin treating needy hepatitis C patients with the latest antiviral drugs instead of waiting until they are sick enough to qualify.

Friday’s decision by the state Medicaid department comes in the midst of a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado and after top health officials asked the department to lift restrictions that determined which patients could receive life-altering treatment.

It also comes as the price of the antiviral drugs — which cure up to 90 percent of patients — has dropped from $84,000 per treatment to about $14,000.

Colorado’s previous policy, which required Medicaid recipients with the virus to have advanced liver damage in order to receive treatment, was “unconscionable,” said Kevin Costello with Harvard Law School’s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, a partner in ACLU’s suit.

“Were a cure for cancer to be discovered, no one would tolerate insurance providers telling patients: ‘We need to wait until you get really sick before we treat you,'” he said in a statement after Colorado’s announcement.

Until about two years ago, the best treatment for hepatitis C included year-long, toxic injections with often-miserable side-effects and an estimated cure rate of only 50 percent. The latest antivirals, pills taken for as few as eight weeks, come with few side-effects and a 90 percent cure rate.

Because of the price drop, the state Medicaid department expects to spend the same yearly amount on treatment but treat about 20 percent more patients. Other states that lifted restrictions treated 5 to 50 percent more people, said Dr. Judy Zerzan, chief medical director for the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.

Department officials said budget figures showing how much the Medicaid department spent last year treating patients with hepatitis C were unavailable Friday. Zerzan said in 2016 that the department spent $26.6 million treating 326 hepatitis C patients — an average cost of $82,000 per person.

Friday’s policy change, she said, was “part of our usual process (in) keeping up with the pace of change and the evidence” and not related to the lawsuit. The new rules take effect Jan. 1.

Among those who asked the Medicaid department to change policy was Denver Public Health director Bill Burman. In a letter to the department last year, Burman wrote that the drug restrictions were leading to more health disparity and death at Denver Health, the largest health care provider for low-income people in Denver.

In addition, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid warned states against imposing “unreasonable” restrictions of the antiviral drugs. Medical associations have recommend the treatment for all people with hepatitis C, not just those in the later stages of liver scarring.

Dr. Sarah Rowan, associate director of HIV and viral hepatitis prevention at Denver Public Health, said she was thrilled to learn of the new policy while in Spain for World AIDS Day. “This marks a critical turning point in the epidemic,” she said via email.

The lawsuit against the Medicaid department is pending. Because the suit is a class-action one, a judge, not the attorneys, must determine whether to dismiss it.

ACLU of Colorado legal director Mark Silverstein called the policy change “a major step forward” to resolving the lawsuit and a “more fiscally sound path” for the state because patients will receive treatment before they have suffered serious liver damage.",01/12/2017
The Denver Post,Seen: Sam Cary Bar Association’s scholarship fund gala,"The ballroom at the Denver Athletic Club is a lovely venue for special events but beyond that, there’s a special reason it was selected as the site for the Sam Cary Bar Association’s Scholarship Endowment Fund Gala.

The DAC was chosen because back in 1972, Denver County Court Judge Gary Jackson, a founder of the Sam Cary Bar Association, was the club’s sole African-American member. Which, you must admit, made for a nice tie-in to the gala’s theme, Back to Our Future.

Jackson, who just weeks earlier had received the Colorado Judicial Institute’s Judicial Excellence Award for County Court Judge of the Year, had a key role in the gala, helping president Jason St. Julien present two of the association’s highest honors to Dianne Briscoe and April L. Jones.

Briscoe, a Denver County Court judge since 2011, was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for her decades of service to the legal community; Jones, an attorney who primarily assists low- and modest-income individuals, received the Warrior for Justice award.

Briscoe’s guests that night included her husband, the Rev. Gilbert McKenzie; daughter LaDawn Sullivan, the Denver Foundation’s director of leadership and equity; childhood friend Cheryl Thomas; and her law clerks, Daniella Silva and Nicole Martinez.

She dedicated the award to her mother, the late Ruth Cousins Denny, who had dreamed of a career in law but turned to teaching and civil rights, instead. “My mother gave of her time, talent and treasure until the day she died,” Briscoe said. “She fought hard for justice and equality.”

The gala also was the occasion for Arapahoe County Court Judge Cheryl Rowles-Stokes to join Don Toussaint, 18th Judicial District Magistrate and president of the Sam Cary Bar Association Scholarship Endowment Fund, in presenting scholarships to Aretha Frazier and Kiah Ellis.

Frazier, a first-year law student at the University of Colorado, lived in Zambia for a time, teaching eighth grade English and working to empower girls and women living with HIV/AIDS. Ellis grew up in Vermont where his father is a blues musician and his mother a filmmaker and came to Colorado to finish his education. He describes himself as one who is “devoted to justice and fighting for the underdog.” His goal is to “Make a difference in people’s lives when their life is the darkest.”

The gala, emceed by journalist Tamara Banks, was attended by many Colorado legal leaders, including Federal Judge Wiley Daniel; state Supreme Court Justice William Hood; Michael Bender, former chief justice of the state Supreme Court; former Denver City Attorney Dan Muse; retired Denver County Court Judges Alfred Harrell and Doris Burd; former Denver District Attorney Norm Early; attorney Jim Lyons; former state Court of Appeals Judge Russell Carparelli; and Denver’s former Manager of Safety, Al LaCabe.

Barclay Jones, son of Sam Cary Bar Association founder Phil Jones, and Velois Cary Rausch, the granddaughter of association namesake Sam Cary, also were there.

Others staying on to enjoy the music of Dotsero were Hollis Booker; Sylvia Jackson; Kimberly Jackson; Salt Creek Oil and Gas CEO Tim Sulser and his wife, Marianne; and Christopher Colley; five-year Platinum Sponsor Cornell Johnson.

The Denver Post,"Ex-surgical tech Rocky Allen, accused of stealing fentanyl, intends to plead guilty, court filing states","Rocky Allen, a former surgical technician whose federal indictment on drug theft charges prompted a multi-state health scare, intends to plead guilty, a court filing on Wednesday states.

Swedish Medical Center in Englewood fired Allen in January for an alleged theft of a needle filled with the powerful narcotic fentanyl. The hospital warned about 2,900 patients who had surgeries while Allen worked there that Allen was carrying a bloodborne pathogen, later disclosed to be HIV. Those patients have been offered free tests for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

According to Wednesday’s court filing, Allen intends to plead guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement with prosecutors. It asks for a change of plea hearing to be scheduled.

Court testimony has revealed that before he was hired at Swedish Medical Center, Allen had been fired from four hospitals in Arizona, California and Washington state. Allen also was court-martialed in 2011 for stealing fentanyl while enlisted in the U.S. Navy.

In June, federal prosecutors revealed that no reported transmissions of HIV or hepatitis B or C by Allen had surfaced at that time.

Allen’s lawyer, Timothy O’Hara, an assistant federal public defender, said during a court hearing in April that Allen’s experiences in Afghanistan left him a drug addict. Allen did not divulge his firings when he sought registration as a surgical tech in Colorado, records show. One hospital that fired him said it found him swapping a doctor’s fentanyl with a syringe of saline solution. Another discovered him passed out on the floor and, upon testing him for drugs, found fentanyl in his system.

Allen’s case also prompted hospitals where he worked in Arizona, California and Washington to warn patients to be tested as well.

Allen’s case and the 2010 drug theft convictions of Kristen Parker, another surgical tech who infected dozens of Colorado patients with hepatitis C when she stole syringes filled with powerful liquid painkillers, helped cause Colorado to tighten registration standards for that profession. The Colorado legislature this year passed legislation requiring surgical technologists and surgical assistants to submit fingerprints for criminal background checks for registration.",29/06/2016
The Denver Post,LGBT choruses perform along Denver’s 16th Street Mall,"Passersby were treated to a pop-up performance in front of Union Station yesterday morning by choruses from GALA Choruses’ Festival 2016, the world’s largest LGBT performing arts event. Singers from North Carolina, Ohio, California and Minnesota took the stage for the outreach performance, their voices echoing across the plaza as brunchers at Snooze stopped to listen.

The first chorus to perform was the Triad Pride Men’s Chorus from Greensboro, N.C. As the members filed neatly onto the risers in their white polos and khaki shorts, artistic director and conductor William Southerland took the microphone to introduce the songs.

“This next one is called ‘I Wish I Were Single Again.’ Last year, we were all really excited in North Carolina when marriage equality was granted, but then we found out that we didn’t have a law in place for us to divorce,” he quipped with a smile as audience members chuckled. “So this is how we felt about that.”

The show that followed was just as cheeky as the song title — ballet moves and a poster with a male model’s six-pack were incorporated.

The pop-up performance at Union Station was one of the outreach performances on the 16th Street Mall. The 10th international choral festival brought together more than 130 choruses with some 6,000 singers from around the world, including Cuba’s only gay chorus and the Beijing Queer Chorus. GALA Choruses holds festivals every four years; this year’s was July 2-6. The attendees spent the last few days in workshops and seminars, as well as listening to each other perform, but the outreach performances are the only ones free to the public.

Other performances were held at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House, the Buell Theatre, and the Boettcher Concert Hall.

Kevin Covell has been performing with the Triad Pride Men’s Chorus for one semester. During the festival, he saw performances by the Columbus Gay Men’s Chorus, the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus, and the Tone Clusters from Canada.

“I just want to bring a bright spot to someone’s day and fill their ears with joyful noise,” he said. “Music is a really important part of people’s lives, and it really helps shine a light in art awareness.”

The Triad Pride Men’s Chorus centered their song selections around what it means to be a man in today’s world. They belted drinking songs, brought the fierceness with a Broadway number from “Kinky Boots,” and ended with a patriotic anthem, “Song for the Unsung Hero.” That tune struck audience members particularly hard.

Alon Mazer, a member of the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington, D.C., watched his fellow choristers perform from the side. Mazer had met up with the Triad Pride members a few weeks earlier when he sang in Raleigh, N.C., in protest of House Bill 2, the law that prevents transgender people from using bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.

“This last song is especially meaningful because there’s definitely a myth that there’s some sort of tension between the LGBT community and people who serve in the armed services,” he said. “Coming from D.C., that’s definitely not true. Having a chorus sing that is very powerful.”

The last chorus to sing in front of Union Station pulled together members of regional choruses — all of them HIV-positive. This chorus was directed by Joseph Buches from the Philadelphia Gay Men’s Chorus. On Sunday, they performed in Central Presbyterian Church.

Carlos Moreno sings with the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles, but as soon as he saw information about this HIV-positive chorus, he signed up. After receiving the music, the members rehearsed just one hour before their first performance.

“I’ve never sung with a chorus that’s all HIV-positive before, so that’s super powerful and impactful,” Moreno said. “One of our songs is called ‘Make Them Hear You,’ and that’s the theme of this whole event. We just want to go out, tell our stories and creative more public awareness.”

Moreno said he hoped this performance would bring people in the audience who might be HIV-positive courage and guidance.

“I want them to know that we’re out and proud, that we’re not ashamed of this,” he said.

Covell said at the end of the day, he just wants people to know that the LGBT community is just like them.

“This event allows people to be seen and heard without all the negative stereotypes in the community,” he said. “We have fun, just like them.”

The Denver Post,"Use of meth, heroin, other drugs may be linked to growing rates of syphilis","Public health officials grappling with record-high syphilis rates around the nation have pinpointed what appears to be a major risk factor: drug use.

“Two major public health issues are colliding,” said Sarah Kidd, a medical officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and lead author of a new report on the link between drugs and syphilis.

The report shows a large intersection between drug use and syphilis among women and heterosexual men. In those groups, reported use of methamphetamine, heroin and other injection drugs more than doubled from 2013 to 2017.

The data did not reveal the same increases in drug use among gay men with syphilis, the group with the highest rates of the disease.

Researchers said the results suggest that drug use — and the risky sexual behaviors associated with it — may be driving some of the increase in syphilis transmission among heterosexuals.

People who use drugs are more likely to engage in unsafe sexual behaviors, which put them at higher risk for sexually transmitted diseases, experts said. The CDC also saw increases in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, and use of the drug was associated with higher syphilis transmission.

“The addiction takes over,” said Patricia Kissinger, an epidemiology professor at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.

For example, people using drugs may avoid condoms, have multiple sex partners or exchange sex for drugs or money — all significant risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases, said Sara Kennedy, medical director of Planned Parenthood Northern California.

“I think it’s impossible to eradicate syphilis and congenital syphilis unless we are simultaneously addressing the meth-use and IV-use epidemic,” Kennedy said.

Syphilis rates are setting records nationally. They jumped by 73 percent overall and 156 percent for women from 2013 to 2017. The highest rates were reported in Nevada, California and Louisiana.

Syphilis — which had been nearly eradicated before its resurgence in recent years — is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated it can lead to organ damage and even death. Congenital syphilis, which occurs when a mother passes the disease to her unborn baby, can lead to premature birth and newborn deaths.

The study’s authors analyzed syphilis cases from 2013 to 2017 and determined which patients had also reported using drugs. They discovered methamphetamine was the biggest problem: More than one-third of women and one-quarter of heterosexual men with syphilis reported using methamphetamine within the previous year.

Substance use among both populations was highest in 13 Western states and lowest in the Northeast. In California, methamphetamine use by people with syphilis nearly doubled for women and heterosexual men from 2013 to 2017, according to the California Department of Public Health.

The intersecting epidemics of sexually transmitted infections and substance abuse make it harder to identify and treat people with syphilis because drug use makes people less likely to go to the doctor and to report their sexual partners, Kidd said.

Pregnant women also may be reluctant to seek prenatal care and get syphilis testing and treatment because of concerns their doctor will report the drug use.

To stem the transmission of syphilis, the CDC urges more collaboration between programs that address STDs and programs that treat substance abuse.

Drug use is an “incredibly huge contributing factor” to somebody getting an STD and transmitting it, said Jennifer Howell, sexual health program coordinator for the health district in Washoe County, Nev.

“Everybody needs to see that we are dealing with a lot of the same clients,” she said.

Fresno County has the highest rate of congenital syphilis in California. Its health department analyzed 25 cases of congenital syphilis in 2017 and determined that more than two-thirds of the mothers were using drugs, said Joe Prado, the county’s community health division manager.

The county has started offering STD testing for people entering inpatient drug treatment facilities, Prado said. “That’s our opportunity to get them screened,” he said.

Those who return for the results are offered incentives such as gift cards. The county also gives people in drug treatment a care package that contains condoms and education materials about sexually transmitted infections, Prado said.

The city of Long Beach sends a mobile clinic to drug treatment facilities, where it provides HIV testing, said Anissa Davis, the city’s health officer. She said Long Beach hopes to expand services to include screening for other sexually transmitted infections.

Although increased collaboration between drug treatment providers and STD clinics is essential, it’s not always easy because they traditionally have not worked together, said Kissinger of Tulane.

“The STI people are hyperfocused on STIs, and the substance-abuse people are focused on substance abuse,” she said. It is an “opportunity lost” if people in drug treatment aren’t screened for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections, she added.

Fighting the rising rates of syphilis will also require more resources, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at UCLA.

“The STD workforce has almost entirely disappeared,” he said. “While policies could be put in place that require syphilis testing, those policies also have to come with resources.”

The Denver Post,Longtime San Francisco Giants owner Peter Magowan dies,"SAN FRANCISCO — Peter Magowan, the lifelong Giants fan who formed the ownership group that kept the team in San Francisco with a sparkling waterfront ballpark, died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 76.

Magowan was a fan ever since going to games at the Polo Grounds in New York and then played a critical role in the team’s success over the last quarter-century.

“The Giants family, the entire Bay Area and the game of baseball lost a man whose passion and loyalty to his favorite team and beloved community made it possible for all of us and future generations to experience the magic of Giants baseball in San Francisco forever,” Giants president and CEO Larry Baer said. “Peter was my mentor and dear friend, and I will forever be grateful for his guidance, support and love. His legacy will be carried on by all those he inspired.”

Magowan helped form the ownership group that bought the franchise for $100 million from Bob Lurie in December 1992 to keep the team from moving to Tampa Bay. One of his first moves was signing Barry Bonds to a six-year, $43.5 million free agent deal even before he formally completed the purchase of the team.

With the game’s greatest slugger in place, the Giants went on to have great success and Magowan put together a plan to build a privately funded ballpark on the water in downtown San Francisco. That park, the first in years built without direct public funding, opened in 2000 and became one of the jewels of the game.

Magowan stepped down following the 2008 season but had put in place the management team that helped bring San Francisco its first World Series title in 2010, followed by championships in 2012 and ’14.

“Peter’s mark on the Giants and the San Francisco community can be felt throughout the ballpark, in which he was intimately involved in the design and planning and throughout the daily operations of the organization,” Baer said. “He set forth a Giants vision to create a winning culture and to serve our fans and the community. Over the past 25 years, we have followed through on his vision and his impact on our community will be felt for decades to come.”

Magowan moved to California in 1958, the same year the Giants relocated from New York to San Francisco. He had a successful business, working 37 years for Safeway Inc., including serving as chairman and CEO from 1980-93 before stepping down after taking over the Giants.

The Giants made the playoffs four times in Magowan’s 16-year tenure running the Giants, including a trip to the World Series in 2002 before losing in seven games to the Angels.

Bonds also went on to set the single-season and career homer records during his tenure with the Giants, hitting 73 homers in 2001 and 762 in his career.

Magowan did significant work in the community, making the Giants the first professional sports team to dedicate an annual game to the fight against AIDS/HIV with the creation of “Until There’s A Cure Day” in 1994. He also formed the Junior Giants program that provided free leagues for kids to play and learn baseball.

Magowan also revered the rich history of the franchise he started following as a child, signing Hall of Famer Willie Mays to a lifetime contract and bringing back Hall of Famers Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda to the organization to serve as special advisers. In 2008, he established the Giants Wall of Fame, which serves as a tribute to the organization’s greatest players of the San Francisco era.

Magowan will be added to the Wall of Fame on Feb. 9.

“Peter Magowan has been a part of my life for a long, long time, first as a fan watching me play in New York and then, remaining a fan when we moved to San Francisco,” Mays said. “Along the way, he became my friend. Peter would call me often to check in. He and Debby cared about me and it was so easy to care about them in return. It’s hard to find the right words just now, but in losing Peter, I’ve lost a great, great friend. He was like my godfather. No one can replace him.”

He is survived by his wife, Debby five children and 12 grandchildren.

“Our family lost a great man today,” the family said in a statement. “We all know how much Peter loved his Giants and San Francisco, and he had that same love and passion for his family. He was so proud of his children and grandchildren, and we will forever cherish the memories we made together.”

The Denver Post,Trump declares U.S. opioid emergency but pledges no new money,"WASHINGTON — In ringing and personal terms, President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged that “we will overcome addiction in America,” declaring opioid abuse a national public health emergency and announcing new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.

Trump’s declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas. But it won’t bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 people a day.

“As Americans we cannot allow this to continue,” Trump said in a speech at the White House, where he bemoaned an epidemic he said had spared no segment of society, affecting rural areas and cities, rich and poor and both the elderly and newborns.

“It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction,” he said. “We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.”

Deaths have surged from opioids, which include some prescribed painkillers, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, often sold on the nation’s streets.

Administration officials said they also would urge Congress, during end-of-the year budget negotiations, to add new cash to a public health emergency fund that Congress hasn’t replenished for years and contains just $57,000.

But critics said Thursday’s words weren’t enough.

“How can you say it’s an emergency if we’re not going to put a new nickel in it?” said Dr. Joseph Parks, medical director of the nonprofit National Council for Behavioral Health, which advocates for addiction treatment providers. “As far as moving the money around,” he added, “that’s like robbing Peter to pay Paul.”

Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said, “Show me the money.”

Trump’s audience Thursday included parents who have lost children to drug overdoses, people who have struggled with addiction, first responders and lawmakers.

Trump also spoke personally about his own family’s experience with addiction: His older brother, Fred Jr., died after struggling with alcoholism. It’s the reason the president does not drink.

Trump described his brother as a “great guy, best looking guy,” with a personality “much better than mine.”

“But he had a problem, he had a problem with alcohol,” the president said. “I learned because of Fred.”

Trump said he hoped a massive advertising campaign, which sounded reminiscent of the 1980s “Just Say No” campaign, might have a similar impact.

“If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it’s really, really easy not to take ’em,” he said.

It’s a path taken by previous presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, all of whom tried to rally the nation to confront drug abuse but fell short of solving the problem. Some people have become hooked on opioids after being prescribed prescription pain killers by doctors after injuries or surgery.

As a presidential candidate, Trump had pledged to make fighting addiction a priority. Once in office, Trump assembled a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study the problem. The commission’s interim report argued an emergency declaration would free additional money and resources, but some in Trump’s administration disagreed.

“What the president did today was historic and it is an extraordinary beginning set of steps to dealing with this problem,” Christie told reporters at the White House after the speech.

Some also faulted the White House for not issuing a wider emergency declaration to deal with the crisis.

Rob Brandt, an Ohio man who lost his 20-year-old son to a heroin overdose in 2011, called Trump’s public health emergency order a “good incremental step” but urged greater focus on prevention and long-term treatment.

“The federal government has lagged behind in truly decisive action,” said Brandt, who opened an opioid recovery center in Medina, Ohio this year, run on private donations and grants.

“We lost 64,000 Americans last year,” he said, “and if you look at, if we were to have a foreign country attack us and kill 60,000 Americans or a terrorist attack that killed 60,000 Americans, we would print money to combat that.”

As a result of Trump’s declaration, officials will be able to expand access to telemedicine services, including substance abuse treatment for people living in rural and remote areas. Officials will also be able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure Department of Labor grants for the unemployed, and shift funding for HIV and AIDs programs to provide more substance abuse treatment for people already eligible for those programs.

Trump said his administration would also be working to reduce regulatory barriers, such as one that bars Medicaid from paying for addiction treatment in residential rehab facilities larger than 16 beds. He spoke of ongoing efforts to require opioid prescribers to undergo special training, the Justice Department’s targeting of opioid dealers and efforts to develop a non-addictive painkiller.

Trump said one specific prescription opioid, which he described as “truly evil,” would be withdrawn immediately from the market. White House spokesman Hogan Gildey later said he was referring to the painkiller Opana ER. That drug was pulled from the market in July at the Food and Drug Administration’s request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Trump’s effort falls far short of what is needed and will divert staff and resources from other vital public health initiatives.

“Families in Connecticut suffering from the opioid epidemic deserve better than half measures and empty rhetoric offered seemingly as an afterthought,” he said in a statement. He argued, “An emergency of this magnitude must be met with sustained, robust funding and comprehensive treatment programs.”

Democrats also criticized Trump’s efforts to repeal and replace the “Obamacare” health law. Its Medicaid expansion has been crucial in confronting the opioid epidemic.

Adopted by 31 states, the Medicaid expansion provides coverage to low-income adults previously not eligible. Many are in their 20s and 30s, a demographic hit hard by the epidemic. Medicaid pays for detox and long-term treatment.

Trump, meanwhile, tempered expectations even as he projected hope.

“Our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better. But get better it will,” he said. “It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency.

“Working together,” he said, “we will defeat this opioid epidemic. … We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse. And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America.”

The Denver Post,"Sean Crumpler, accused Aurora child sex trafficker, pleads guilty Monday to three counts","Sean Travis Crumpler, accused of luring teen boys to Colorado where he exploited them in a rented house in Aurora, on Monday pleaded guilty to three felony counts of human trafficking of a minor for sexual servitude.

As part of his plea, the 50-year-old California sex offender, agreed to a 50-year prison sentence. He also was ordered to donate a significant sum to organizations that aid homeless youth in Denver and will serve five years of parole upon his release. He will be held without bail until his formal sentencing in May.

Crumpler had been accused of 18 other counts in the case, including a pattern of sexual assault on a child by someone in a position of trust and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He also was charged knowingly exposing a victim to HIV.

He had been set to face trial in April.

Shackled and handcuffed in orange jail dress, Crumpler acknowledged to Arapahoe County District Judge F. Stephen Collins that he had victimized four boys between April and August of 2015 in Aurora.

“Yes, your honor,” he said again and again.

Crumpler was charged after authorities say they discovered a dozen boys and men between the ages of 16 and 21 living with him in Aurora. He allegedly housed, fed and provided them with drugs, alcohol, iPhones and other items in exchange for sex with him and others.

The FBI called the case “extremely unusual” because of the number of victims involved.

A 21-year-old man who lived at the home told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” The man also said Crumpler was HIV-positive and had unprotected sex with those living in the house, officials say.

According to court testimony, Crumpler would use men he had victimized as boys to recruit new teen victims. Crumpler used Grindr, a gay social network and dating website, to identify his victims.

“It was understood that if you were going to live there, you were going to have sex with Mr. Crumpler,” testified Detective Chris Fanning, a member of the FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force, which investigates human trafficking in Colorado.

Crumpler, called by his Grindr screen name “Daddy” by many of the people who lived at the house, seemed to prey on vulnerable young men, such as runaways, investigators said. During a search of the house authorities said they found sex toys and a variety of documents, including Social Security cards and a high school identification card.

Crumpler’s bail in the human trafficking case was revoked in January after authorities say he violated the terms of his release by hanging out with juveniles and paying to keep two 17-year-olds and a pair of men at a Westminster hotel. He had been free on a $100,000 bail under conditions that included a requirement that he have no contact with anyone under the age of 18.

On Jan. 5, members of the FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force went to the Cottonwood Suites in Westminster to arrest Coddie Favela, 21, and Ricardo Barron, 20, on human trafficking charges.

When officers entered room 223, they found both men and two boys, all of whom were naked.

“There were several items of clothing, uneaten food, trash, unopened condoms, female wigs and makeup all over the room,” according to a court document.

According to a police report, Crumpler had rented the room for all of the males in the room.

Before Crumpler entered his plea on Monday, Favela and Barron each pleaded guilty to one Class 4 felony count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Prosecutors say the pair were victimized by Crumpler as young teenagers and then went on to help him recruit his later victims.

They were sentenced to six years probation in a penalty Judge Collins said was “very lenient” but which accounted for their hardships.

“It does acknowledge their own victimization by Mr. Crumpler,” Collins said.

Barron said he was 15 years old and facing homelessness when he was recruited by Crumpler and flown to Colorado.

“I know what I’ve done,” Favela said. “I can’t do anything to fix it.”",06/03/2017
The Denver Post,U.S. shouldn’t quit NATO; it’s a public good,"“It has been a nervous year,” Tom Lehrer once remarked, “and people have begun to feel like … a Christian Scientist with appendicitis.” That was 1965, and he was speaking of the escalation in Vietnam and the Dominican Civil War. With President Donald Trump steering foreign policy, Americans surely know how he felt.

The latest news is that Defense Secretary James Mattis has told NATO allies that if they don’t start carrying their weight, the U.S. is going to “moderate its commitment” to the region. As an abstract matter of principle, I’m firmly behind this. Only five NATO countries actually hit their targets, and three of them are a lot poorer than the sponging grifters that have cut their militaries back … while enjoying the safety of the U.S. security umbrella.

The freeloading countries don’t even send a fruit basket to Washington to say thanks. In fact, as a rightish American who’s spent a bit of time abroad, I can personally attest that many of those NATO members’ citizens feel free to disparage our massive military budget, as if their smaller budgets were some sort of moral sacrifice rather than an unearned benefit paid for by U.S. taxpayers.

There, I got that off my chest. I hope we all feel better.

Nonetheless, even for me, Mattis’ statement is a sort of “gulp” moment. The Europeans aren’t the only people who benefit from the American security umbrella. The fact that the world’s biggest rich economy is willing to spend so much of its GDP on the military doesn’t just mean that other countries don’t have to; it also means that other countries don’t bother because they can’t possibly catch up.

There are downsides to this. Countries with a big hammer will inevitably end up using it in ways that turn out to be stupid. (See: Iraq.) It also, inevitably means that the security umbrella of the world will be used in ways that the country that owns it likes. (See complaints by every country except the U.S., many of them justified.) But for all that, you can certainly imagine a country with an America-sized military advantage doing much worse things with it. Many worse things. In fact, when you think about alternative histories, we’re pretty far into the “happy” zone of the spectrum. Not all the way to utopia, mind you. But a lot better than you’d imagine, if you’d never heard of the United States of America and you were plotting out your science fiction novel with a dominant, heavily armed nation.

A more evenly multi-polar world would look like — well, perhaps you’re acquainted with a little tiff known to historians as World War I. You may even have read about the exciting sequel they made when the first production turned out to be so great. That was terrifying enough when the nastiest stuff in the world’s arsenal was toxic gas. It gets even more terrifying when you have bombs that can flatten a city or worse.

Unfortunately, military spending is the ur-example of what economists call a “public good.” These provide a benefit to everyone, and once the benefit has been created, it cannot be taken away from anyone.

Imagine a public health campaign that eliminates HIV, wiping it off the face of the planet. That’s an enormous benefit to the world. But if I pay to get rid of HIV, I have no way to charge you for the benefit I provided. Once I’ve gotten rid of HIV, you benefit from my investment, whether you pay me back or not.

Public health, defense, crime control — these are classic public goods because for some people to get the benefit, everyone has to. Unfortunately, the optimal self-interested strategy is therefore to let other people pay for the stuff, while you ride free. If everyone practices the optimal strategy, no one gets the benefit. Enter government, which has to secure these things, if we’re going to have them, and force everyone to pay the bill.

That’s fine for crime, because its effects are local and the cost of management relatively moderate. If the Topeka City Council figures out a way to wipe out crime, there’s probably very little spillover effect in San Luis Obispo, and zero cost to San Luis Obispoans. But in the case of plagues and national defense, we can run into a problem, which is that the effects are very large, and the investment required can be huge. Imagine that we didn’t treat national defense as a federal responsibility, and handed it to the states. Maine and Texas would have gigantic militaries; places like Connecticut and Oregon might have sizeable Coast Guards. But the rational military budget for a place like Nebraska would be pretty close to zero. Because border states are of limited size and financial capacity, the militaries of those places would probably be smaller than everyone would like, even as the proud people of Montana labored under gruesome taxes to protect Coloradans from the fearsome Canadian horde.

In fact, you see this problem with NATO. Of the five countries that are actually pulling their weight, only two can be said to be doing so for reasons that aren’t strictly rational self-interest (the U.S. and Britain). The other three — Greece, Poland and Estonia — border non-NATO countries and are pretty worried about future conflict with a military power that meets or exceeds their own. The problem is that neither Poland nor Estonia could ever even remotely hope to repel a Russian invasion. If the U.S. gets fed up with its NATO partners and withdraws, Germany would be depending on the Poles to fend off any Russian aggression — or hoping that Russia got sick of all the winning after they took Poland and stopped there. (See: World War II.)

Military capacity takes time to build up; even the famous mobilizations of the 20th century were built around a core of officers who had spent their lives thinking about little things like the best tactics to repel invasions, and how to transport large numbers of troops and supporting items to the front while keeping them in condition to fight, and how to get people to overcome their self-interest to pick up a gun and run into harm’s way.

Only the U.S. has consistently invested so much in this buildup. Because the U.S. has decided to provide this public good of military protection to much of the world, other countries have let those skills atrophy. If the U.S. actually decided to become isolationist, other countries might quickly become willing to assume its military roles, but would not immediately be able to. Pouring money into the defense budget now will not create the majors and lieutenant colonels and generals you need; those arise only if you invested in lieutenants years back.

All of humanity now benefits from this public good: a world in which major wars are pointless. No government except the U.S. can possibly provide that. (Even if you think you’d fancy a world policed by China better, its economy does not yet throw off enough surplus to play “lone superpower,” and neither does Russia’s.) Multilateral institutions can step into the breach somewhat, but multilateral institutions don’t have the same taxing power that a territorial state does, and it shows. All NATO can really do is complain that members aren’t meeting their targets. The U.S., as the member picking up the tab, can threaten to pull out if other states don’t contribute more. But following through on that threat would hurt us as well as them.

Given those two choices, I’ll grit my teeth and pay the taxes and practice my frozen smile for my next trip to Europe. But if Trump makes the other choice, then I, like everyone else in the world, will have to live with the result.

The Denver Post,"Selena Gomez’s kidney transplant: Young, minority women disproportionately affected by lupus","In the world of celebrities, there are diseases such as HIV/AIDS and breast cancer that are very “popular” and well understood, thanks to years of fundraising and awareness campaigns by stars. And there are those diseases that are less so. Lupus, an autoimmune disorder that can damage organs, is in the second category.

When Selena Gomez shocked her 126 million Instagram followers on Thursday by revealing that she had disappeared from the public eye this summer because she was getting a kidney transplant because of lupus, her fans had many questions.

Many wondered how someone so young and seemingly healthy – Gomez, 25, made numerous appearances this spring, looking radiant – could suddenly need such a radical surgery. Some commented that perhaps her case was atypical.

It’s the opposite. Lupus, in which the body’s immune system turns against itself, strikes women of child-bearing age at the highest rates. Those who are minorities are especially vulnerable. While only about 10 percent of women with lupus who are white progress to kidney failure, about 20 to 40 percent of women who are African American or Hispanic do so.

Gary Gilkeson, associate dean at the Medical University of South Carolina and chair of the Lupus Foundation of America’s medical-scientific advisory committee, says the disease is incredibly challenging to diagnose because it looks like many other conditions in its early stages. People with lupus may first experience fatigue, joint pain or a little bit of rash on their bodies and can go for a long time before their doctors realize it is more serious.

“Many people see two or four physicians before it is picked up that’s what the problem is. It is difficult to diagnose early on, but the earlier the diagnosis the better the chance of us catching it before it gets too out of hand,” Gilkeson said.

A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Thursday:

“I’m very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn’t promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of. So I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health. I honestly look forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these past several months as I have always wanted to do with you. Until then I want to publicly thank my family and incredible team of doctors for everything they have done for me prior to and post-surgery. And finally, there aren’t words to describe how I can possibly thank my beautiful friend Francia Raisa. She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me. I am incredibly blessed. I love you so much sis. Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made. For more information regarding Lupus please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org/ -by grace through faith”

No one knows exactly what causes lupus. More than 60 genes have been identified as putting people at higher risk, but environmental factors also seem to play a large role. Some scientists believe that certain viral infections may trigger lupus. There is evidence that different organic pollutants and even exposure to radiation through substances like uranium could activate the disorder.

Some of the most important research on lupus going on right now involves early identification of people who may develop lupus before they have full-blown symptoms. The National Institutes of Health is funding a study that looks at people with a certain blood-based indicator and one or two symptoms that suggest lupus. Some of those people will actually progress to the disease and some will not, and the goal is to try to figure out what the difference is between the two groups.

While kidney failure is a serious, life-threatening complication of lupus, the number of people having successful treatment with transplants is increasing. People have two kidneys but need only one. So a growing number of patients have managed to find friends or family members who are matches and can donate, or they participate in “kidney exchanges” in which a friend of one patient will donate to a stranger who is a match in exchange for the second patient’s friend donating to the first patient.

In Gomez’s case, the donor was one of her BFFs, actress Francia Raisa, who has appeared on “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” and played a hockey player turned figure skater in one of the recent remakes of “The Cutting Edge.”

The good news for patients like Gomez, Gilkeson said, is that many women with lupus who undergo transplants go on to live long, healthy lives. There’s something about the immuno-suppressants that transplant patients must take to prevent rejection of the new organs that also keeps lupus at bay.

“I think it’s important to emphasize that lupus patients can lead relatively normal lives,” he said. “She will be able to resume her career, go to college if she wants, and having children is possible.”",14/09/2017
The Denver Post,Prosecutors: Rocky Allen’s likely sentence could be just over 11 years in prison for drug thefts,"A former surgical technologist could face a sentence of just over 11 years in prison and fines as high as $300,000 for jeopardizing the health of thousands of patients by stealing fentanyl syringes on the job while carrying HIV, federal prosecutors said in a court filing.

Rocky Allen repeatedly landed jobs in health care facilities in multiple states by lying about his addiction, drug thefts and work history, the filing states. In a previous court filing, Allen said he intends to plead guilty to two drug-theft counts. A plea hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

“The defendant has been addicted to fentanyl since at least 2011,” the filing states. “He used his employment in medical hospitals as a surgical technologist to gain access to the drug and stole fentanyl from his employers.”

Allen, who is HIV positive, prompted a health scare when Swedish Medical Center in Englewood fired him in January for allegedly stealing a fentanyl syringe. The hospital has offered free testing to about 3,000 patients to determine whether they contracted HIV or hepatitis B or hepatitis C during surgery. So far, no public disclosures have been made that Allen has infected any of those patients.

The prosecution filing shows that Allen was fired from at least five health care facilities in California, Arizona and Washington before Swedish hired him in August. He also had been court-martialed for stealing fentanyl in 2011 while enlisted in the Navy and stationed at a hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He also created a fake company to bolster his credentials and hide his true employment history, according to the filing.

Jan. 22, a Swedish employee saw Allen acting suspiciously in an operating room to which Allen was not assigned, according to the filing. While medical personnel were preparing for surgery, Allen switched a syringe filled with fentanyl with a syringe containing saline, the filing states.

It was not the first time Allen had stolen fentanyl and placed “replacement” syringes in operating rooms, the prosecutors added.

“Because fentanyl is a powerful opiate used in major surgeries, 100 times more powerful than morphine, administration of a substance other than the opiate itself caused serious pain, or prevented the relief of serious pain, to the patients who were intended to receive the drug during the surgeries,” the filing states.

Allen likely will face between seven years and three months in prison to 11 years and three months in prison, according to the filing. He also may face a fine of between $25,000 to $250,000. If additional criminal conduct in his past is discovered, the probable sentence could rise to more than 17 years, the prosecutors add.

The defense has not filed documents detailing what it believes the proper sentence for Allen should be. Allen’s lawyer, Timothy O’Hara, an assistant federal public defender, said during a court hearing in April that Allen’s experiences in Afghanistan left him a drug addict, and that he had not received proper drug treatment.

Allen’s case and the 2010 drug theft convictions of Kristen Parker, another surgical tech who infected dozens of Colorado patients with hepatitis C when she stole syringes filled with powerful liquid painkillers, helped cause Colorado to tighten registration standards for that profession. The Colorado legislature this year passed legislation requiring surgical technologists and surgical assistants to submit fingerprints for criminal background checks for registration.",11/07/2016
The Denver Post,Hurricanes drive addiction issues into public square,"By Carla K. Johnson and Nomaan Merchant, The Associated Press

In the whirr of preparations for Hurricane Irma, a needle exchange program in Miami’s Overtown neighborhood handed out extra syringes to heroin users. Others trying to break from the drug’s grasp picked up advance medication from methadone clinics.

Disasters cause stress, and stress can cause relapse for people struggling with addiction, whether their problem is alcohol, tobacco, pills or heroin. Authorities planning for the devastating effects of hurricanes now factor in the heightened danger of relapse and overdose.

The problems of alcoholism and addiction become more public in a storm, said researcher Andrew Golub of the National Development and Research Institutes in New York, who studied illicit drug users in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

“During a storm, it becomes harder to hide and cope with one’s addiction in private,” Golub said.

Scientists learned from Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy . Drug users took chances during storms, researchers found, avoiding evacuation to stay near their dealers or sharing needles with strangers putting themselves in danger of HIV and hepatitis. Those in treatment missed doses of medications and went back to street drugs to avoid withdrawal sickness. During Sandy, clinics that lost power measured methadone by candlelight.

“Disasters like this interrupt treatment,” said Enrique Pouget, whose team interviewed 300 injection drug users in New York after the 2012 storm.

Methadone programs, highly regulated by the government, are required to have disaster emergency plans. The state of Florida, in cooperation with federal authorities, granted methadone clinics discretion to provide up to five days of medication ahead of Hurricane Irma.

In Texas and Louisiana, some patients took home advance doses of methadone. Others received it in shelters or from alternative facilities.

Florida’s first needle exchange program — aimed at preventing overdoses and blood-borne infections — faces its biggest challenge yet with Irma. This past week, Dr. Hansel Tookes and his team gave away a week’s supply of clean needles and overdose reversal kits, or Narcan.

“We want to make sure all of our people have Narcan so they can save lives and be first responders in the storm,” Tookes said of the 400 drug users who rely on his program . Drug users equipped with Narcan can save others who overdose.

Mark Kinzly, co-founder of the Texas Overdose Naloxone Initiative, said his group distributed around 500 kits to clinics along the Texas coast in the midst of Harvey cleanup. Storms can be disastrous for people with addictions because they interrupt routines and schedules, he said.

“There’s people that are going to be without jobs and without homes because of this hurricane,” Kinzly said. “They’re going to be less stable in their overall lives to begin with. That can be dangerous.”

In the aftermath of flooded Houston, Julie Boon oversaw repairs at a sober-living home while giving advice to residents based on her own 30 years of sobriety.

“Have faith in the foundation you’ve built,” said Boon of Eudaimonia Recovery Homes. “If you get into fear, reach out and speak to somebody.”

People in long-term recovery have the ability to cope with disasters, said Julia Negron of Venice, Florida, a former injection drug user and organizer of the Suncoast Harm Reduction Project, a grassroots group working to prevent overdoses.

“You deal with life as it comes. So here you go: Here’s a test,” she said.",09/09/2017
The Denver Post,Gilead to pay $11.9B for cancer treatment developer Kite,"By Tom Murphy, The Associated Press

Gilead Sciences will pay $11.9 billion in cash to buy Kite Pharma and plant a stake in an emerging area of cancer treatments that train a patient’s immune cells to attack tumors.

Kite’s portfolio of potential treatments includes one for the blood cancer lymphoma that could receive U.S. regulatory approval later this year.

The Santa Monica, California-based company specializes in developing treatments that are custom-made to target a patient’s cancer. Called CAR-T, this type of therapy involves removing immune cells from a patients’ blood, reprogramming them to create an army of cells that can zero in on and destroy cancer cells and injecting them back into the patient.

Gilead has developed top-selling treatments for HIV and the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus, but leaders of the biotechnology company told analysts Monday that its push into oncology has been largely nascent so far. They said that the Kite deal helps establish Gilead as a leader in so-called cellular therapy and provides an opportunity to diversify revenue.

“(Kite’s) work has opened a clear path towards the potential cure for lymphoma patients who’ve run out of options and are desperately in need of treatment,” Gilead President and CEO John Milligan said.

Investors have been pushing Gilead management for a couple years to diversify by making a big deal, because its once-surging revenue from hepatitis C drugs such as Sovaldi and Harvoni has been declining amid increased competition and pressure from insurers for lower prices.

“It got those drugs when it acquired Pharmasset,” for $11.1 billion in early 2012, noted Erik Gordon, a professor and pharmaceuticals analyst at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

With the Kite deal, he added, “Gilead is paying a large premium on top of Kite’s stock price, which already has run up this year. ”

The companies expect approval for Kite’s potential treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma around November in the United States and next year in Europe.

Others developing CAR-T therapies include Novartis Corp. Earlier this summer, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 10-0 in favor of the leukemia treatment developed by the University of Pennsylvania and Novartis. That pushed the treatment for a common childhood blood cancer closer to becoming the first gene therapy available in the United States, with approval possible as early as September.

Foster City, California-based Gilead Sciences Inc. said that it will pay $180 for each share of Kite Pharma Inc., marking a 29 percent premium to the company’s closing price on Friday. The deal has been approved by both companies’ boards and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

Shares of Kite jumped 28.2 percent to $178.32 in afternoon trading on Monday. Gilead’s stock rose 2.3 percent to $75.46.

The Denver Post,"In record-setting veto, Hickenlooper rejects bill adding autism to conditions eligible for medical marijuana","Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday set a new benchmark for vetoes in a year as he rejected a measure that would have provided medical marijuana access for people with autism spectrum disorder, saying he could not ignore “overwhelming concerns from the medical community.”

“If we sign that bill we end up, without question, in some way encouraging more young people to look at this as an antidote for their problems,” he told reporters before turning down the legislation, House Bill 1263.

The measure would have added autism spectrum disorder to the list of conditions eligible in Colorado for medical marijuana treatment, a list that includes cancer, glaucoma, HIV or AIDS, post-traumatic stress or certain chronic or debilitating diseases or medical conditions with certain symptoms.

State lawmakers cannot override Hickenlooper’s veto because they are no longer in session.

According to legislative fiscal analysts, 93,314 people were authorized to use medical marijuana in Colorado as of the end of February, 314 of whom were under age 18.

The governor’s office says Hickenlooper on Tuesday met with families of children with autism as he weighed whether to sign House Bill 1263. Several mothers and their children set up camp outside his office doors at the Colorado Capitol as they waited for news.

“I think its unfortunate,” said state Sen. Steve Fenberg, a Boulder Democrat and one of the bill’s prime sponsors. “I think there are a lot of families that it would benefit. The reality is the traditional pharmaceuticals aren’t always the right choice for these kids, either.”

Fenberg also rejected the notion that the legislation could have led to more kids — outside of those with autism — using marijuana.

“This is not for people who have just a little bit of Asperger (syndrome) or something,” he said. “This is for people who have kids who at the end of the day are hurting themselves. It’s not a justification to be able to smoke pot. It’s genuinely about medicine to help people. And there’s science behind it.”

Hickenlooper, as part of his veto, ordered state health officials to study whether marijuana can be an effective and safe treatment for autism.

Hickenlooper vetoed three other bills Tuesday — House Bill 1083, House Bill 1011 and Senate Bill 156. They dealt, respectively, with exempting private planes from sales and use taxes, allowing publicly traded corporations to invest in marijuana businesses and loosening requirements that counties publish financial information in newspapers.

In all, the governor has rejected 9 measures from the recently ended 2018 legislative session — the most he’s ever turned down in one year.

Since taking office in 2010, Hickenlooper has vetoed 23 bills, according to his office.

The year of his second-highest number of vetoes was 2014, when he turned down five bills.

With the veto, Hickenlooper was nearing the finish line Tuesday of sifting through the more than 400 bills sent to him by the Colorado General Assembly this year.

“Some of these bills have very good sides and very bad sides,” Hickenlooper told reporters.

He chose a piece of workforce development legislation — House Bill 1266, a symbol of one his biggest priorities over two terms — for his final public bill signing Tuesday before a crowd huddled into his office.

Hickenlooper had a pretty good comeback when I asked him who he will be voting for in the governor's race in light of ballots going out yesterday (https://t.co/BisrFHnxgn) ""I haven't gotten my ballot yet,"" he said. — Jesse Aaron Paul (@JesseAPaul) June 5, 2018

“Hopefully these programs are going to thrive and endure long after the name Hickenlooper has lost any currency,” he said.

Hickenlooper was then handed a set of pens from every year of his administration to sign the measure.

“It is, I will say, a little bit bittersweet,” he said as he prepared to turn the bill into a law.

After creating the new policy, Hickenlooper took a few questions from reporters — whom he thanked for their hard work over the years — before being showered in applause and preparing to head off to Detroit for a speaking engagement.",05/06/2018
The Denver Post,One Colorado to honor Ted Trimpa and other allies at Aug. 20 event,"Lawyer, lobbyist and gay political activist Ted Trimpa will finally get the recognition he’s had coming for a while on Aug. 20, when he receives a lifetime achievement award from One Colorado, the state’s largest advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Coloradans.

Trimpa was going to be honored at last year’s Ally Awards but had to postpone due to emergency heart surgery.

Instead, he leads a list of civil rights allies to be honored at the fundraiser at the Four Seasons hotel in Denver from 6:30 to 10 p.m.

“The 2016 Ally Award winners truly embody what it means to be a friend and champion for LGBTQ Coloradans,” Daniel Ramos, the interim executive director of One Colorado Education Fund, said in a statement Tuesday. “One Colorado Education Fund celebrates the work of allies because their courage is an incredible asset to our work.”

“This year has been filled with achievements for the LGBTQ community — but it has also been touched by tragedy. It is because of the commitment and passion of our allies that we are able to continue advocating for LGBTQ Coloradans and their families.”

Tickets are available at www.allyawards.com.

Here are bios of this year’s honorees provided by One Colorado:

TED TRIMPA | Lifetime Achievement Award

Ted Trimpa, from a tiny farm town in Kansas, eventually came to Colorado and joined forces with activist Tim Gill to change the political landscape across the state and nation. The two leveraged donors — gay and straight — to target legislative candidates who were attempting to ban same-sex marriage in their states. It is because of Ted’s ability to compromise that he was largely responsible for the Democratic takeover in the Colorado Legislature in the 2004 election. While Ted’s work isn’t done, he is deserving of a Lifetime Achievement Award because of his dedication to improving lives of LGBTQ Coloradans, and his ability to find middle ground.

MATTHEW HURON | CEO, Good Chemistry

With fifteen years of experience in the marijuana industry, and widely recognized as one of the most experienced cultivators of marijuana in the United States, Matthew Huron started Good Chemistry Colorado in 2010. Huron became involved in the medical marijuana industry when his father and his father’s partner were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. In 1996, when medical marijuana became available in California, Huron saw firsthand the symptomatic relief patients experienced from this alternative medical treatment. In 2000, he began growing medical marijuana for AIDS patients throughout the state, founding and operating a nonprofit medical marijuana co-op that became one of the most respected and well-known facilities in San Francisco. In 2010, he launched Good Chemistry Colorado, which is considered to be one of the finest vertically-integrated cannabis companies in the state.

KRISTIN STROHM | managing partner, Starboard Group

Kristin Strohm co-founded the Starboard Group in 2008 to marry her love of politics with her desire to give back to the community. Known for her ability to maintain grace under pressure, Managing Partner Kristin Strohm’s poise, confidence and creativity give her an edge in the fast-paced world of politics. Kristin is intimately acquainted with Colorado’s local businesses, foundations, and nonprofits. She was a founding member and served on the board of Coloradans for Freedom, the group that successfully organized conservatives to advocate for the passage of civil unions at the state legislature. Kristin is also one of Congressman Mike Coffman’s closest, longtime advisers. Due in large part to her counsel, Coffman has bucked Congressional Republican Leadership to take a number of pro-LGBTQ votes.

The Denver Post,This won’t hurt a bit: Good news about health that was overshadowed in 2016,"By Lenny Bernstein, The Washington Post

In a year of birth defects from the Zika virus, lead contamination of Flint’s water, a startling decline in life expectancy and the ever-rising death toll from opioid overdoses, there was, in fact, some good news about health. In keeping with the holiday spirit, and in recognition of the vast sums of money devoted to our well-being, please consider some of the bright spots from last year.

– The number of people who smoke continued to decline to record lows. This partly contributed to the lone bright spot in the life expectancy report: Cancer rates are down, though the disease remains the No. 2 killer of Americans. Teen pregnancy rates also continued their record-setting slide.

– Another reason cancer rates have dropped: New immunotherapy drugs are having a significant impact for a longer period of time against a wider array of cancers.

– There’s new hope for an HIV vaccine; it’s being tested right now. A vaccine against Ebola proved 100 percent effective in a study in Guinea. And more boys are being vaccinated against HPV. A lot more.

– A woman received the first uterus transplant performed in the United States in February. (It soon failed however, because of infection.)

– Some outside-the-box thinking may expand the pool of available organs for transplant.

– And another innovative project gave a paralyzed man a sense of touch.

– Scientists found a new antibiotic in an unlikely place: inside the human nose.

– A new way of safeguarding children from potentially lethal peanut allergies appears to provide lasting protection.

– A sharp-eyed lab tech, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and two good hospitals saved a Baltimore man from certain death when he picked up a rare parasite.

– And at 70, a man underwent the gender-altering surgery he always wanted, supported by his wife of 48 years.",26/12/2016
The Denver Post,Bone fragment stuck to surgical tool provided early clue to Porter hospital’s cleaning woes,"Officials at Porter Adventist Hospital first learned of possible trouble with its processes for cleaning surgical instruments as early as last April, when a doctor in the middle of a spine operation found a bone fragment from a previous surgery stuck to a tool waiting on a nearby tray, hospital officials said Thursday.

It wasn’t until a year later, though, that the hospital began notifying thousands of patients who underwent certain surgeries there of an infection risk related to its sterilization procedures. The notification also came two months after inspectors from a national hospital accreditation organization warned Porter officials in February of flaws in the cleaning process.

Those details were among the deeper insights Porter officials offered Thursday in their most public accounting to date of the turmoil that also caused the hospital to suspend all surgeries for nearly a week.

Morre Dean, a senior vice president for Centura Health, which operates Porter, said the hospital delayed in notifying patients after the February inspection because it needed time to gather information and because there was no indication that patients were suffering an abnormally high rate of infections.

“It was a process issue,” Dean said. “It wasn’t necessarily something that was flagging out that ‘You have an outcomes issue.'”

As surgeries resumed on a limited schedule at the hospital Thursday, the Porter officials said they had sent approximately 5,800 precautionary letters to patients who received orthopedic or spinal surgeries at the hospital between July 21, 2016, and April 5. The early date corresponds with the most recent certification for the hospital’s cleaning practices, and Dean said the hospital decided to go all the way back to that date when notifying patients out of an abundance of caution.

The Colorado Health Department announced Wednesday that it had learned of a number of patients who suffered surgery-related infections during that time period, although it could not tie the infections specifically to the hospital’s instrument-cleaning practices.

Dr. Patty Howell, the hospital’s chief medical officer, said Thursday that all of those cases involved infections at the incision site and were probably caused by bacteria. The hospital has identified no infections caused by viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. While Howell said the hospital is still gathering information about all the cases, she said there is no indication there was a spike in infections during the time period in question.

“We have not seen a bump in our overall totals or infection rates,” she said.

But the case of the tainted tool on the surgical stand provides insight into the hospital’s cleaning troubles and its response.

Howell said the surgeon found the bone fragment on a tool that was on a tray adjacent to the operating table and waiting to be used. The contaminated tool was not used on the patient, the entire tray of tools was swapped out for a clean one, and Howell said the patient received extra monitoring to watch for infection. It was the only instance Porter found of a contaminated tool making it that close to a patient, Howell said.

The problem, Howell said, had to do with the first step in the hospital’s cleaning process: hand-scrubbing of instruments. The instruments then go through a machine wash and then through a separate sterilization machine. But she said pieces not wiped off well enough initially can make it all the way through the process.

A series of checks is designed to catch such mistakes. But she said orthopedic and spinal surgeries — which often involve small bits of bone and more complicated instruments — are trickier to clean up.

At the time, the hospital viewed the contaminated tool as an isolated incident and did not see a broader trend, a Centura spokeswoman said.

But in February, The Joint Commission, a hospital standards and accreditation organization, visited Porter after receiving a complaint about the hospital’s cleaning processes and found “opportunity for improvement,” Dean said

After working with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Dean said the hospital decided to notify patients.

“Patients would rather be notified than to not be notified if they think there is any risk at all,” Dean said.

Porter suspended surgeries last week for a separate issue, though, after noticing small spots of mineral residue on its instruments, Howell said. The hospital was concerned about water quality, but subsequent testing showed the water to be fine and the residue to be the result of mineral buildup in one of its cleaning machines.

Howell said the hospital has installed some new equipment and made other upgrades to ensure that the problems don’t recur.

“We’re sorry for any anxiety that we caused,” Dean said.",12/04/2018
The Denver Post,Panel calls on FDA to review safety of opioid painkillers,"By Carla K. Johnson, The Associated Press

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration should review the safety and effectiveness of all opioids, and consider the real-world impacts the powerful painkillers have, not only on patients, but also on families, crime and the demand for heroin.

That’s the conclusion of a sweeping report Thursday from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. It urges the FDA to bolster a public health approach that already has resulted in one painkiller being pulled from the market. Last week, the maker of opioid painkiller Opana ER withdrew its drug at the FDA’s request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.

“Our recommendation is for a much more systematic approach, integrating public health decision-making into all aspects of opioid review and approval,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School, a member of the report committee. “It would be an ambitious undertaking.”

The report details how two intertwining epidemics ’ prescription painkillers and heroin ’ led to the worst addiction crisis in U.S. history and provides a plan for turning back the tide of overdose deaths.

Prescribed, legal drugs are a gateway to illicit drugs for some, the report says. Other users start with pills diverted to the black market. Crush-resistant pills and other restrictions can have unintended consequences, shifting use to heroin and illicit fentanyl.

The epidemic’s broad reach into rural and suburban America “has blurred the formerly distinct social boundary between use of prescribed opioids and use of heroin and other illegally manufactured ones,” the report says.

The authors say it’s possible to stem the crisis without denying opioids to patients whose doctors prescribe them responsibly. But long-term use of opioids by people with chronic pain should be discouraged because it increases dangers of overdose and addiction.

Requested by the FDA last year under the Obama administration, the report was greeted by FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a Trump appointee. Gottlieb said in a statement that the opioid epidemic is his “highest immediate priority” and he “was encouraged to see that many of (the) recommendations for the FDA are in areas where we’ve already made new commitments.”

Still, no immediate review of opioids as a class of drugs is planned by the FDA, other than the agency’s routine safety surveillance. Gottlieb said the FDA re-evaluates the safety of approved drugs with post-market information required from drugmakers and other sources.

“We will continue to consider what additional information is needed to ensure we have the right data to make important, science-based decisions,” he said.

Beyond the FDA, the report recommends:

’Better access to treatment for opioid addiction, including use of medications such as buprenorphine, in settings including hospitals, prisons and treatment programs. (The revised Senate Republican health care bill released Thursday includes $45 billion for states to use for addiction treatment and other responses to the opioid crisis, a boost over the $2 billion in the initial bill.)

’Year-round programs that allow people to return unused opioids to any pharmacy at any time, rather than only at occasional events. Some pharmacies, including Walgreens, have installed kiosks where people can get rid of pills.

’Insurers pay for pain control that goes beyond opioids to include non-drug treatment. The report doesn’t specify which treatments insurers should cover, but does outline what early evidence exists for acupuncture, physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation, calling them “powerful tools.”

’More research on the nature of pain and dependency on opioids and development of new non-addictive treatments.",13/07/2017
The Denver Post,Trump order would ban most transgender troops from serving,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under “limited circumstances,” following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.

The White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of “gender dysphoria” — those who may require substantial medical treatment — “presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.”

Trump surprised the Pentagon’s leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said his state will continue its legal fight against the ban.

“California will take every measure available to prevent President Trump’s discriminatory action that harms or marginalizes transgender service members — or any other transgender Americans who wish to courageously defend our nation,” he said.

“This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards — including those regarding the use of medical drugs — equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.

The new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, “No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.”

The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing “anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.”

“There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,” said HRC President Chad Griffin.

Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy “effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.”

Trump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.

In Mattis’s Feb. 22 memo to Trump explaining his recommendation, which the Pentagon made public late Friday night, he cited exceptions to the ban.

“Currently serving service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration’s policy took effect and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria,” Mattis wrote.

Earlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.

The issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It’s unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump’s decision.

The Justice Department issued a statement Friday saying it will continue to defend the Pentagon’s “lawful authority to create and implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation. Consistent with this new policy, we are asking the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions.”

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama’s administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.",24/03/2018

The Denver Post,"Ex-CEO Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli’s reputation precedes him, affects jury selection","By Tom Hays, The Associated Press

NEW YORK — Several potential jurors at the federal securities fraud trial of Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli were excused on Monday after telling the judge they couldn’t be impartial toward the flamboyant former pharmaceutical CEO because of his notoriety for raising the cost of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent.

At jury selection in a Brooklyn courtroom, U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto questioned the potential jurors at sidebars out of earshot from Shkreli. One called him “the face of corporate greed,” another labeled him “the most hated man in America” and a third gestured as if wringing his neck.

Yet another was sent home after confiding that when she saw Shkreli sitting at the defense table, “I said in my head, ‘That’s a snake.'”

Opening statements could come as soon as Tuesday.

Since his high-profile arrest in late 2015 when he was led into court in a gray hoodie, the 34-year-old Shkreli has been free on bail and free to speak his mind on social media in ways that could complicate his defense. He went on Twitter to label members of Congress “imbeciles” for demanding to know why his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of Daraprim, a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis and HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill.

He took to YouTube for a series of lessons on chemistry and stock market analysis. His Twitter posts mocking a freelance journalist turned so creepy — one showed a fake photo of him canoodling with her — that his account was shut down. And on Facebook, he mused about the possibility of being “unjustly imprisoned.”

Shkreli “travels to the beat of a very unique drummer,” exasperated-sounding defense attorney Benjamin Brafman said at a pretrial hearing this month.

Columbia law professor John Coffee compared the situation to President Donald Trump’s unruly tweeting habits. “A lawyer can caution him,” he said. “But just like Trump, he doesn’t have to listen.”

Though Shkreli’s notoriety came from Daraprim, the federal securities fraud case is unrelated. Prosecutors say that after Shkreli lost millions of dollars through bad trades through his side business hedge fund, he looted a second pharmaceutical company for $11 million to pay them back. The defense has argued that he had good intentions.

“Everybody got paid back in this case,” his lawyer said. “Whatever else he did wrong, he ultimately made them whole.”

The defense has floated the possibility that it would put Shkreli on the witness stand to try to highlight how he grew up in a working-class Albanian family in Brooklyn, taught himself chemistry, interned at a financial firm founded by CNBC’s Jim Cramer and struck out on his own to become a rising star in biotechnology startups. He wanted to develop new life-saving drugs after seeing “several classmates and other children he knew struck down by debilitating disease,” court papers say.

Prosecutors call it a ploy to portray the boyish-looking Shkreli as “a Horatio Alger-like figure who, through hard work and intelligence, is in a position to do great things if only the jury would ignore the evidence and base its verdict on sympathy.” The real Shkreli was a con man often undone by his own mouth, they say.

The government has cited claims by one of Shkreli’s former employees that Shkreli harassed his family in a dispute over shares of stock.

The Denver Post,Poll: Lift ban on gay blood donation?,"Following the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, there have been renewed calls for the FDA to abolish its policy of not allowing gay men who have been sexually active in the past 12 months to donate blood.

The FDA justifies its policy by pointing to higher rates of HIV infection experienced nationally among gay and bisexual men.

Until this year, the FDA had excluded all men who had had sex with other men in their lifetimes from giving blood.

Colorado’s U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, who is gay, argues that sensible screening criteria should be behavior based, with the main concerns being intravenous drugs and unprotected sex.

What do you think? Should the FDA lift its ban on gay blood donation?",15/06/2016

The Denver Post,Ask Amy: Parents refuse to vaccinate a child. Are others at risk?,"Dear Amy: My 2-year-old grandson’s parents refuse to have him immunized. This is causing a huge problem with the parents of our other grandchildren.

Our 6-month-old granddaughter has not had all of her vaccinations yet, and her mother is worried about her being around the unimmunized 2-year-old. She is refusing to come to our home for the holidays if the unvaccinated child is there. We have several other grandchildren under the age of 10 whose parents are also concerned.

Someone is going to miss this family gathering.

How vulnerable is our youngest grandchild, who is still in the process of getting her first-year shots?

— Frustrated and Concerned

Dear Frustrated: I turned to David Thoele, a pediatrician at Advocate Children’s Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois, for professional guidance.

Dr. Thoele responds: “Back in the ‘bad old days,’ when everyone saw polio, measles, diphtheria and other diseases causing severe illness and death, few questioned the value of vaccines.

“With the widespread success of vaccinations, these diseases have almost disappeared, thanks to individual immunity (people who are immunized) and ‘herd immunity.’ Herd immunity means most people are vaccinated, so everyone is protected: the disease is so rare it can’t spread. Herd immunity protects us all, but is especially important for people with weak immune systems, such as babies, people with cancer, HIV, and cystic fibrosis.

“If enough people don’t vaccinate their children (vaccination rates have been decreasing), herd immunity will decrease, leading to outbreaks of these diseases. A recent outbreak of measles occurred in children who visited Disneyland — and most who caught the disease were unvaccinated, or infants.

“The American Academy of Pediatrics notes that: Unimmunized children are at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, and also create risk of disease outbreaks in young infants and children who medically cannot be immunized.”

I note the irony that this fortunate 2-year-old is likely protected from preventable disease by being surrounded by others who have been immunized. Because of this, understand that unless this toddler is in contact with people with active measles, polio or other diseases (highly unlikely), the chance the other children would catch one of these illnesses is exceedingly rare.

Dr. Thoele and I both hope that everyone attends the family get-together, and that all family members should try their best to be nice to one another. There is, fortunately, no vaccine preventing that.

Dear Amy: I recently got married. I am 44, my husband is 50.

It is a second marriage for both.

He told me his first wife was crazy and that she fabricated abuse allegations to the point where she has a lifetime restraining order against him.

Twice he appealed the court’s decision and lost, so the order remains in place. I chose to believe him.

Someone sent me some of the court documents outlining what his crazy ex-wife claims he did to her.

It was full of physical, financial, verbal and sexual abuse.

I wonder if I was wrong to believe him.

What do you think?

— Worried

Dear Worried: My understanding is that a “lifetime” (or “permanent”) restraining order is issued through the courts, after both sides have presented evidence. The allegations would have to meet a standard of proof at this hearing. Your husband’s “crazy” ex would have had to convince the court that her allegations were true and that she was in continuing danger.

Your husband allegedly went to court twice to try to get this lifted, but was unable to convince the court that he was no longer a danger to his ex.

Understand that if the ex-wife is volatile, having a restraining order in place would also protect your husband from any contact with her. Without contact, she can’t continue to make allegations. Why appeal it?

You don’t mention who sent you these documents, but you should assume that the person was trying to warn you, and yes, you should take this very seriously. You should go to the courthouse in the county where the alleged offenses happened (if you are able) to access these public records for yourself, or see a lawyer to try to verify them — and the claims they contain.

You can also contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at thehotline.org.

Dear Amy: Your answer to “Worried Sister,” who was concerned about exposing her adolescent daughters to her violent, sex offender brother over the holidays was spot-on. That answer ranks as one of the best pieces of advice you have ever written.

— Cynthia

Dear Cynthia: Thank you. My advice was to trust her instincts.

The Denver Post,"Pollution kills 9 million people each year, new study finds","Dirty air in India and China. Tainted water in sub-Saharan Africa. Toxic mining and smelter operations in South America. Pollution around the globe now contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths annually – or roughly one in six – according to an in-depth new study published Thursday in the Lancet. If accurate, that means pollution kills three times more people each year than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, with most of those deaths in poor and developing countries.

“Going into this, my colleagues and I knew that pollution killed a lot of people. But we certainly did not have any idea of the total magnitude of the problem,” said Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and co-chair of the commission behind the report. “I think all of us were really surprised when we saw this.”

The two-year project, which relied on data from researchers in more than 130 countries documenting the causes of disease and premature deaths in recent decades, found that poor air quality was the most significant pollution-related killer. That includes both outdoor pollution tainted by mercury, arsenic and other harmful particulates, and household air dirtied by the burning of wood, dung and other organic materials. The result: An estimated 6.5 million deaths in 2015 from heart disease, strokes, lung cancer and other respiratory problems.

Water pollution, which includes everything from unsafe sanitation to contaminated drinking water, accounted for an additional 1.8 million annual deaths from gastrointestinal diseases and other infections, researchers found.

Pollution in the workplace also took a heavy toll on some of the world’s poorest workers. From bladder cancer in dye workers to the lung disease pneumoconiosis in coal miners, researchers found that occupational exposure to various carcinogens and toxins was linked to about 800,000 deaths annually.

In 2015, the largest number of deaths attributable to pollution occurred in India and China, with an estimated 2.5 million and 1.8 million deaths respectively. Other severely affected countries include Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya.

Beyond the massive human toll, the authors of Thursday’s report also focused on the financial toll caused by pollution-related health problems.

“Until now, people haven’t recognized what an incredible hit pollution makes on the economy of a country,” Landrigan said. “Pollution control can stimulate the economy because it reduces death and disease.”

They estimated the hit to national budgets at about 1.3 percent of gross domestic product in low-income countries, compared to about 0.5 percent in developed, high-income countries. In addition, nations facing crippling pollution tend to spend much more on health care to treat diseases related to the problem.

“When you’re looking at developing countries, you really have to address this challenge if you want to move people out of poverty and into the middle class,” said Gina McCarthy, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who was not involved in the study but had studied its conclusions. “It is holding people back.”

And the warming of the Earth’s climate is likely to fuel more deaths in the absence of international action, she said.

“Climate change is going to exacerbate the very problems that are identified in this article. There will be more contagious and infectious diseases. There will be more lives lost, more injuries, if we don’t identify a path that gets us out of the hole that we’re in,” McCarthy said. “What people don’t realize is the instability that results from poverty, the instability that results from migration as a result of climate change.”

The startling conclusion that pollution accounts for 16 percent of deaths worldwide is, of course, an estimate. But the findings build on previous studies, including a 2016 report from the World Health Organization, detailing the extent to which pollution represents a public health crisis. “If countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy, millions will continue to become ill and die too young,” then-WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said last year.

McCarthy said the Lancet study also is built on the most complete epidemiological data available.

“These are the best numbers that we have available to us. And even if they’re off by a factor of 10, you’re still talking about huge, huge impacts. But they’re not off by a factor of 10,” she said. “It’s very clear if you go to other countries and it’s clear if you go to some of our own communities that they are being held back because of the impact of pollution on their kids and their elderly. And we have to stop thinking that because we can’t see the pollution and it’s not as visible that it’s not there.”

Landrigan said there is “an old wive’s tale” that developing countries inevitably suffer through troublesome pollution and disease on their way to becoming more prosperous.

Rather, he and the study’s other authors insisted that countries must do much to reduce pollution and improve the health of their citizens – and that they will reap economic benefits for doing so. In addition, he said developed nations can play a meaningful role in helping poorer countries slash pollution, and major nonprofit foundations that have largely steered clear of the problem must be convinced that it is a global priority.

“It doesn’t have to [get worse]. It’s not an inevitable outcome,” Landrigan said of the annual death toll. “Pollution control is a winnable battle.”",19/10/2017
The Denver Post,A Georgia 2-year-old’s kidney transplant was put on hold — after his donor father’s probation violation,"A father in Georgia who had prepared to donate a kidney to his 2-year-old son said last week that he is being forced to wait after a recent stint in county jail.

Anthony Dickerson’s son, A.J., was born without kidneys and Dickerson, who is a perfect match, was ready to donate one of his, he told NBC affiliate WXIA. He was arrested days before the planned transplant but released from Gwinnett County Jail this month to undergo surgery. Now, he said, the transplant center at Emory University Hospital has put it on hold – in a case that one expert called befuddling.

“That’s all I ever wanted – was a son,” the 26-year-old father told the news station. “And I finally got him, and he’s in this situation.”

Dickerson, who was already on probation over numerous charges, including theft and forgery, was arrested Sept. 28 on charges of possession of a firearm and fleeing or attempting to elude police, said Shannon Volkodav, a spokeswoman for Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office.

The family told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that medical personnel sent a letter to authorities, requesting that Dickerson be escorted to Emory for a preoperative appointment so he could continue with the scheduled surgery. The next day, A.J.’s mother provided authorities with the necessary documentation showing that Dickerson was scheduled to donate a kidney on Oct. 3, Volkodav said.

“Our staff worked diligently with court personnel and the District Attorney’s Office to make arrangements for Mr. Dickerson’s early release so that he could follow through on his scheduled kidney donation for his young son, AJ,” Volkodav said in a statement Monday to The Washington Post. As a result, she said, Dickerson was released Oct. 2 on a $1,000 bond.

“We wish this family well in their pursuit of medical assistance for their son and hope that little AJ is soon enjoying good health,” she said in the statement.

But after authorities secured his release, the family said, the hospital backpedaled.

In a second letter, hospital officials said the Living Donor Transplant Team at Emory would now require Dickerson to provide evidence that he has complied with his parole officer for the next three months.

“We will reevaluate Mr. Dickerson in January 2018 after receipt of his completed documentation,” it read, according to the newspaper.

But the family argues that the transplant should not be about Dickerson.

“It’s about my son,” the child’s mother, Carmella Burgess, told WXIA. “He’s been through a lot. It’s like we’ve been waiting on this. And Dad making a mistake shouldn’t affect what he wants to do with our son.”

The family told the news station that they are at a loss – A.J., who had a stroke a couple of months ago, needs the transplant, and putting him on a waiting list for a kidney will take too long.

Asked about its decision to postpone the transplant, Emory spokesman Vincent Dollard said in a statement to The Post:

“Emory Healthcare is committed to the highest quality of care for its patients. Guidelines for organ transplantation are designed to maximize the chance of success for organ recipients and minimize risk for living donors. Transplant decisions regarding donors are made based on many medical, social, and psychological factors. Because of privacy regulations and respect for patient confidentiality, we cannot share specific information about our patients.”

Though it’s unclear why exactly Emory appeared to go back on its decision, experts say transplant centers look at many factors when evaluating a living donor, including health risks and whether the donor will be reliable and accessible.

Dickerson’s medical history is not publicly known.

But according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit that manages the transplant system in the United States, living donors “should be in good overall physical and mental health.

“Some medical conditions could prevent you from being a living donor. Medical conditions that may prevent a living kidney donation may include uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, HIV, hepatitis, acute infections, or a psychiatric condition requiring treatment. Since some donor health conditions could harm a transplant recipient, it is important that you share all information about your physical and mental health. You must be fully informed of the known risks involved with donating and complete a full medical and psychosocial evaluation.”

Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics and head of the division of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, said policies are determined by authorities and transplant centers, not by law.

“Usually when centers balk at a donor, it’s for some reason having to do with a medical problem that hasn’t been disclosed that poses additional risk . . . or a worry that the donor can’t follow up with medical care if something goes wrong,” Caplan said Monday in a phone interview. “But I don’t find either of those particularly great reasons not to use him as a donor.”",17/10/2017
The Denver Post,Mike Pence is Donald Trump with a veneer of seriousness,"By Evan Fleischer, Special to The Washington Post

When Mike Pence was selected as Donald Trump’s running mate, the descriptions followed a familiar pattern: “a sober, conservative legislator” (The Atlantic), “a seasoned politician who could help bring together disparate blocs of the Republican coalition” (The Washington Post) and “the best choice Trump could have made” (the political blog FiveThirtyEight).

On Tuesday, after the vice-presidential debate, the pattern continued: The National Review deemed him “more serious, more mature, more knowledgeable, more his own man, more presidential” than his opponent, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. On MSNBC, Chris Matthews said that Pence “came across as a grown-up.” Overseas, the French newspaper Le Monde ran the headline that Pence “rekindled the Republican flame.”

With a candidate like Trump at the helm of their party, it’s no wonder Republicans are in a hurry to cast Pence as the sober counterpart to wild and unpredictable Donald, a kind of check on his running mate’s propensity for immaturity and bombast.

The problem is simply that Pence is an inane man — not just silly, but a little bit empty, too. Pence isn’t so much a balance for Trump’s frenzied, aimless energy as he is a translator for it, someone who can lend the veneer of seriousness to the patently absurd, but only briefly, and with very little to add of his own.

Consider: Pence is a man who opposed the 2008 bailout (and, for those who might be coming into political consciousness now, let’s make this clear: The world financial economy really was on the verge of collapse in 2008); who claimed that no one dies from smoking; that the movie “Mulan” was liberal propaganda. Pence signed a law that required funerals for fetuses, once claimed a law that would allow businesses to refuse service to gay people wasn’t about discrimination (it led to discrimination within a week of its signing), and once said that money shouldn’t be given to AIDS groups that “celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus” — as if people were perhaps attempting to fight against HIV by spreading it.

By way of substance in the transcript of the debate, Pence was thick on platitudes and low on tangible plans: “We are going to meet obligations to our seniors.” “Really restore law and order.” Talking about institutional racism “really has got to stop.” He cited Trump’s Arizona speech as Trump’s immigration plan. He advanced the canard of false equivalence that to be a Syrian refugee is to be a terrorist. He criticized Obama for not getting a status of forces agreement in Iraq, though there’s no guarantee that a perpetual U.S. soldier presence would have made the situation in Iraq any better. He spoke about the need to demilitarize North Korea. He also repeated the false claim that ICE endorsed Trump, which did not happen. Pence also claimed Trump had never uttered a series of insults he most definitely did, many in the past several months, some on camera.

That sort of rhetorical paucity was on display when I went to see Pence speak last month on an exceptionally rainy night in colonial Williamsburg, Va. On the fringes of his small crowd, I wondered what sort of man decides that he will be the vice-presidential pick for Trump.

But Pence’s presentation provided nothing by way of reply: Indeed, it didn’t provide much of anything at all. He was a sleepy version of Pappy O’Daniel from “O Brother Where Art Thou,” telling the crowd how great it was, and how he’d be “call[ing] the man” that was Trump on the phone after the rally was over and finished to tell him what a great crowd the great crowd was, letting the tautological loop carry itself off into the great unknown. It was a solid Trumpism, yet another sign that the potential VP is only quieter than his running mate, but not much more substantive.

In his 2005 essay “Host” — about John Ziegler, who hosted an eponymic talk show in Los Angeles from 2004 to 2007 — David Foster Wallace considered the strange climate wherein passionate disquisitions on O.J. Simpson were de rigueur (with Ziegler assuring a black caller at one point that “the last thing I am is racist on this”), and observed that “it’s unlikely that any middle-aged man could really go around this upset all the time and not drop dead. It’s a persona, in other words, not exactly fabricated but certainly exaggerated … and of course it’s also demagoguery of the most classic and unabashed sort.” This is the role of a talk radio host: To channel the anger and discontent of his listeners and to translate it into some language that sounds at once respectable and valid and provocatively familiar.

And that’s where it hit me: If — as its most reductive — Trump is the man from reality TV, then Pence is the man from talk radio.

He is a host.

The Denver Post,Bill Clinton to leave board of foundation health project,"By LISA LERER, Associated Press

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — Former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea will leave the board of a health project connected to the Clinton Foundation, should Hillary Clinton win the White House.

Their departure from the Clinton Health Access Initiative was one of several changes outlined by the organization on Wednesday aimed at minimizing potential conflicts of interest in a future Clinton administration.

Already, the Democratic presidential nominee has faced significant criticism about ties between the charitable foundation started by her husband and her role as secretary of state. Those questions are only likely to intensify should she become president, forcing the Clinton Foundation to begin taking steps to insulate her from future political fallout.

Bill Clinton announced last month that if his wife was elected president, the foundation would no longer accept foreign and corporate donations, he would step down from its board and he no longer would raise money for the organization.

But the Clinton family would maintain some control over its sprawling charitable empire. Chelsea Clinton would remain on the foundation’s board and CHAI, the affiliated health project, would continue to accept corporate and foreign money.

In a statement, CHAI said it would no longer use the Clinton name in its branding even though the organization has no plans to change its acronym. Along with Bill Clinton and Chelsea, three other board members appointed by the Clinton Foundation who are also longtime friends and advisers to the Clinton family will step down from the board: Bruce Lindsey, Ira Magaziner and Maggie Williams.

“If Secretary Clinton is elected President, the changes outlined here will be implemented and CHAI would become an organization completely independent of the Clinton Foundation,” said the group, in a statement.

Founded in 2002, CHAI has worked to expand access to antiretroviral treatment to millions of people suffering from HIV/AIDS in the developing world, increase pediatric AIDS treatment and accelerate the rollout of new vaccines.",14/09/2016
The Denver Post,"Tillerson to abolish most special envoys, including climate","WASHINGTON — Most of the United States’ special envoys will be abolished and their responsibilities reassigned as part of the State Department overhaul, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Congress on Monday, including envoys for climate change and the Iran deal.

Special envoys for Afghanistan-Pakistan, disability rights and closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center will be eliminated under the plan. But President Donald Trump’s administration plans to keep envoys for religious freedom, fighting anti-Semitism and LGBT rights, despite speculation from critics that it would seek to downgrade those priorities.

Lawmakers of both parties, think tanks and even the diplomats’ association have long called for absorbing some of the countless U.S. envoys and special representatives into related offices, to help reduce redundancies across the State Department’s notoriously unwieldy bureaucracy. But the idea has attracted new scrutiny amid the Trump administration’s plans to drastically cut the State Department’s budget and concerns that Trump was eschewing the promotion of American values overseas.

While State Department officials stressed that changes to the flow chart don’t necessarily signal a change in priorities, in some cases the policy implications are clear. Elimination of the Guantanamo closure envoy dovetails with Trump’s plans to keep the prison open. The president has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris global climate deal and threatened to do the same with the Iran nuclear deal.

Of 66 current envoys or representatives, 30 will remain, a cut of 55 percent. Nine positions will be abolished outright. Twenty-one will be “integrated” into other offices, five merged with other positions, and one transferred to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government’s foreign aid arm.

In each case, the envoys’ staff and their budgets will be absorbed by the office taking over their functions. That shift will free up significant funds that Tillerson can draw upon as he restructures other parts of the agency, said a State Department official, who wasn’t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. For example, merging the cyber envoy into the broader Economic and Business Affairs bureau will boost the latter’s budget by $5.5 million.

Tillerson, in a letter to Congress, said he believed the State Department could “better execute its mission” by integrating some positions, pointing out concerns that the current system diluting the government’s effectiveness by creating multiple power centers dealing with the same issue. The number of special envoys has grown over the years.

“Today, nearly 70 such positions exist within the State Department, even after many of the underlying policy challenges these positions were created to address have been resolved,” Tillerson wrote.

The pruning offers the first concrete information about how Tillerson’s sweeping overhaul will affect the State Department and its approximately 75,000 employees. Since taking office in February, Tillerson has been scouring the agency and soliciting input from diplomats about how to trim the agency down. A roughly one-third budget cut and elimination of thousands of jobs are expected.

Those anticipated cuts have driven down morale among diplomats, as Tillerson has acknowledged, playing into concerns that Trump’s “America First” approach means the U.S. will stop promoting human rights or helping the most vulnerable global populations.

The Trump administration will keep envoys or at-large ambassadors for women’s issues, hostages, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, human trafficking, HIV/AIDS and Holocaust issues. There will no longer be special envoys for the Arctic, Syria, Myanmar, Libya, Haiti, Sudan and South Sudan, though regional offices will assume those portfolios. The envoy for six-party talks in North Korea, currently vacant, won’t be filled.

In a 2014 report, the American Foreign Service Association, which represents career diplomats, recommended retaining only a handful of envoys while eliminating or merging the rest.

Tillerson’s letter responded to legislation passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July that took aim at the proliferation of special envoys by forcing Tillerson to tell Congress which positions he wanted to keep, and to secure Senate confirmation for all envoys in the future. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the committee’s chairman, praised Tillerson for working to “to responsibly review the organizational structure of special envoys.”

Some special envoys are mandated by Congress. The Trump administration will ask lawmakers to repeal those mandates.",29/08/2017
The Denver Post,"Report reveals underground U.S. haven for heroin, drug users","NEW YORK — A safe haven where drug users inject themselves with heroin and other drugs has been quietly operating in the United States for the past three years, a report reveals.

None were known to exist in the U.S. until the disclosure in a medical journal, although several states and cities are pushing to establish these so-called supervised injection sites where users can shoot up under the care of trained staff who can treat an overdose if necessary.

In the report released Tuesday, two researchers said they’ve been evaluating an underground safe place that opened in 2014. As a condition of their research, they didn’t disclose the location of the facility — which is unsanctioned and potentially illegal — or the social service agency running it.

The researchers offered little data, and their main finding was that no one died while injecting at the safe place. There were two overdoses on site, which were reversed by staff members using the overdose medication naloxone.

Advocates and some politicians in recent years have called for government-sanctioned injection sites as the U.S. grapples with the opioid epidemic. More than 52,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015 — the most ever — fueled by soaring abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers. Government statistics for the first nine months of last year, also released Tuesday, show overdose death rates continuing to spiral.

Some say the new report could have an impact on efforts to establish safe injection sites around the U.S. Such sites have been backed by lawmakers in New York, California and other states, along with officials in cities like Seattle, San Francisco and Ithaca, New York.

“It shows people that it’s possible” to operate one of these in the U.S., said Lindsay LaSalle, an attorney with Drug Policy Alliance who has helped draft safe haven legislative proposals in six states.

Injection sites are legal in countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland where medical professionals monitor drug users. They also provide clean needles to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis C. Ideally, they also steer users into treatment and other services.

Some experts say new approaches are needed to fight the opioid epidemic, including safe havens. But they’ve faced legal and political hurdles. Critics have argued these places may undermine prevention and treatment, and seem to fly in the face of laws aimed at stopping use of deadly illicit drugs.

Safe injection sites are different from syringe exchange programs, which were once controversial but now exist in 33 states.

The underground safe haven is open between four and six hours a day, five days a week, according to Alex Kral, a San Francisco-based researcher with RTI International, and Peter Davidson of the University of California, San Diego. Their report was published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The space consists of two rooms — an “injection room” with five stainless steel stations with mirrors and stools and a room next door where users are monitored afterward. There are trained staff on hand, but no one who is medically licensed, according to the researchers. Smoking is not allowed there, but drugs like heroin, pain pills, cocaine and methamphetamine are.

Use of the space was by invitation only. Most visitors are white, homeless men. It was used 2,500 times over two years by over 100 people, although researchers say the exact number of participants isn’t known because the facility relies on anonymous surveys.

There’s no data on deaths or drug use by clients who injected when the site was closed and it’s not known whether any went into treatment, Kral said.

The study also didn’t look at issues opponents worry about, like whether creation of a safe place is associated with an increase in people beginning to try drugs, said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University who nonetheless applauded the organization’s effort to try to stop overdose deaths.",07/08/2017
The Denver Post,Third hospital that employed Colorado surgical tech to test patients,"A second Arizona hospital said Monday it will offer free HIV and hepatitis tests to surgical patients who may have been put at risk by a former surgical technologist alleged to have stolen drugs and swapped needles at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood.

Former surgical tech Rocky Allen worked at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale, Ariz., from May 19 to July 2, 2014, spokesman Jeff Nelson said.

Hospital officials “understand this situation may cause anxiety among some of our former patients,” Nelson said. The hospital is “moving toward establishing free testing for Hepatitis B & C and HIV as early as possible for those surgical patients who were treated at the time of Mr. Allen’s employment.”

Allen also previously worked for HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenixbefore getting fired for a “violation of a workplace policy when he tested positive for use of a controlled substance,” according to the hospital, which also is offering free testing.

Allen did not include information from Arizona on his application to work as a surgical tech in Colorado.

The Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies requires surgical techs seeking work here to disclose names of former employers and misdemeanor criminal convictions relating to drugs or alcohol. Failure to do so is grounds for denial or license revocation.

In Allen’s Colorado application obtained by The Denver Post, Allen answered “no” to history of disciplinary action taken against him by “any board or licensing agency in any state or country.” He also failed to cite his employment history with both Arizona hospitals.

Swedish has offered free blood tests to about 2,900 patients who had surgery from Aug. 17, 2015, to Jan. 22. Allen was fired and his license suspended last month after he was accused of removing a fentanyl syringe during a surgical procedure and replacing it with another.",15/02/2016
The Denver Post,One Colorado honors Ted Trimpa as lifetime advocate who “dreams big”,"Lobbyist Ted Trimpa was honored for the “fingerprints” he has left on the struggle for gay rights nationwide, but his story marches hand in hand with his upbringing in Kansas.

His longtime friend Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor who served as secretary of Health and Human Services during President Obama’s first term in the White House, explained Trimpa’s long history of struggle and victory as she presented him a lifetime achievement award at One Colorado’s sixth annual Ally Awards at the Four Seasons hotel in Denver Saturday night.

“Ted is the epitome of our state slogan, which is, ‘To the stars through difficulty,'” she said of Trimpa, the principal and chief executive director of the Denver-based Trimpa Group.

“Ted is always shooting for the next horizon. Ted does not dream little. He dreams big.”

Colorado. Lt. Gov, Donna Lynne spoke of Trimpa’s subtle approach to influencing change, before Trimpa characterized change as a process driven by personal philosophy.

“The main lesson I would take away from what I do is always assume positive intentions, give people the benefit of the doubt, try, look for common ground, not common enemies,” Trimpa said in his acceptance speech. “It is much easier to poison a well than to dig one.”

One Colorado lauded Trimpa for working with activist Tim Gill to leverage donors and to campaign against legislative candidates against same-sex marriage. The organization credited Trimpa with helping Democrats take the majority in the Colorado legislature in 2004.

One Colorado is the state’s largest advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer Coloradans and their families.

Other award recipients Saturday night were:

Nita and Rudy Gonzales and the Gonzales Family, Servicios de La Raza; Escuela Tlatelolco.

Matthew Huron, CEO of Good Chemistry, which provided medical marijuana for those who were suffering from HIV/AIDS and created a compassion program to provide cannabis to sick patients who could not afford it.

Kristin Strohm, managing partner of the Starboard Group, who worked to help pass civil unions by recruiting Republicans to the cause.

The People’s Choice Award winner was Dan Reirden, an attending physician in the adolescent medicine and infectious disease sections at The Children’s Hospital of Colorado and the medical director of The Children’s Hospital Youth and Young Adult HIV program. The runner-up was the Rev. Christopher Gilmore of Sixth Avenue United Church of Christ in Denver.

One Colorado earlier released bios of the honorees.

Dave Montez, One Colorado’s executive director, introduced the organization’s new leader, Daniel Ramos, at the beginning of the evening. Montez is stepping down to become director of the Latino Engagement Fund for the Democracy Alliance in Washington, D.C.

Montez is the former acting president of GLAAD and its former chief of staff. For five years he was a program officer at the Colorado-based Gill Foundation.

“While tonight is about allies — and most people know I never met an unexpected ally I didn’t like — those days after the marriage victory and the Orlando tragedy reminded me of something,” Montez said. “No organization will fight for the LGBTQ community like an LGBTQ organization.

“We must continue that fight and we must continue to invest in LGBTQ organizations that are doing this work. During our moments of unity, the One Colorado team endured long hours of tireless work away from their families to make sure that all of us had somewhere to share our joy and our sorrow. In those moments, I could not have been more proud to be part of One Colorado. And I am incredibly grateful for the trust that this organization placed in me. It has been a ride that I won’t soon forget.”

Ramos, most recently One Colorado’s deputy director, congratulated Montez for “making it to your last day.”

“Dave led us through bringing the Freedom to Marry to Colorado,” Ramos said. “And at a time when many equality organizations closed their doors around the country, Dave ensured our work continued to move forward.”

The crowd of 400 included some of Colorado’s top Democratic and Republican leaders, including Lynne, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette and Mike Coffman, as well as Attorney General Cynthia Coffman.",20/08/2016
The Denver Post,29th annual AIDS Walk Colorado may be Denver’s last,"The streets of Cheesman Park swelled Saturday morning for what may be the last annual AIDS Walk Colorado.

Fundraising concerns have weighed heavy on organizers’ minds since the 2015 5K walk and run, but crowds came out in numbers similar to recent years.

“People think there’s a cure — they don’t hear much about AIDS deaths anymore,” said Monique Apolinar, a 56-year-old mother from Westminster. “It’s kind of gone on the back burner.”

Colorado Health Network, an organization that provides resources like housing, dental care and food assistance for about 6,000 people in Colorado with HIV, hopes to raise $250,000 from AIDS walk participants this year, said Jeff Trujillo, event manager for AIDS Walk Colorado.

At a meeting of its partner agencies around the state after the 2015 walk, the groups decided the annual walk could end and be replaced with a smaller memorial event if fundraising falls short of the event’s goal, Trujillo said. That decision would be made by November .

About 1,000 people register for the event each year, but the number of registered participants who raise money has gradually declined during the past two decades. Only about 500 of this year’s walkers raised money, Trujillo said.

“People think that the disease isn’t something they have to think about,” said Trujillo, who added that the public has turned its attention to more talked-about diseases and fundraising events.

Apolinar has seen that shift through her 23-year streak of participating in the walk.

“You hear a lot of ads about the breast (cancer) walk, but you don’t hear as much for the AIDS walk,” said Apolinar, who has known about a dozen friends who have died of AIDS in the past three decades.

Her family, standing out in purple and yellow shirts, walked carrying a banner with the beaming face of Apolinar’s brother, Richard, who died of AIDS in 1993 at age 32, Apolinar said. Every year since, the family has come to honor him. On Saturday, the walk drew four generations of family members.

Apolinar said her brother knew the cure wouldn’t come in his lifetime and he stopped taking his medication because it made him hallucinate, have bad thoughts and feel nauseated.

Now, Apolinar, a registered nurse at Denver Health medical center, says AIDS medication helps keep patients alive longer and gives them a better quality of life. She sees about 10 AIDS patients on her floor each month, but that’s far fewer than what the center used to draw, she said.

And Apolinar emphasized there’s still no cure.

“There’s apathy toward the disease,” Trujillo said, adding that he thinks there’s a lack of education among younger people and consequently, most new HIV infections occur in that age group.

“It’s important to (raise awareness) so that we don’t have a repeat of that epidemic three decades ago,” Trujillo said.

At its peak in 1996, the event raised about $1.6 million, according to Trujillo. It only raised about $275,000 in 2015, but attendance has been fairly consistent throughout the years, and this year’s turnout looked slightly bigger than last year’s, Trujillo said. 2015’s attendance was about 7,000, according to a news release from Colorado Health Network.

“If it goes on, it’s gonna be something more low-key,” said Trujillo, who added that the food vendors, merchandise and beer garden that were added to the event in recent years would not return. “It may be just a memorial rally. It probably won’t even be at Cheesman Park.”

But Darby Bailey, a 31-year-old Aurora mother, worries about ending the walk.

“I think any kind of education is important … (It’s) uncomfortable because we’re in 2016 and people still don’t know the basic facts of the disease,” said Bailey, who has an uncle with AIDS.

“The more you know, the harder it is to ignore,” she said.",20/08/2016
The Denver Post,Feds arrest Swedish Medical surgical tech accused of stealing drugs,"The surgical technologist accused of stealing a powerful narcotic drug at Swedish Medical Center, prompting wide-scale testing of thousands of patients for HIV and hepatitis, was arrested Tuesday.

The hospital has not released any results, but a Denver attorney claimed Tuesday night that two people had tested positive for hepatitis B.

Rocky Allen, 28, shuffled into a federal courtroom Tuesday afternoon wearing bluejeans and a sweatshirt, with his arms and legs shackled. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen L. Mix advised him of his rights, and Allen asked for a court-appointed lawyer.

Federal agents tried to arrest him last week, but Allen surrendered to authorities around 9 a.m. Tuesday. Officials did not say where he was in the interim.

The former surgical tech remains in custody on charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit, according to a U.S. attorney’s office news release.

A federal grand jury indictment says Allen tampered and attempted to tamper with a syringe containing fentanyl citrate by removing the syringe containing the substance and replacing it with a similar syringe containing “other substances.”

Further, Allen obtained the controlled substance, fentanyl citrate, by deception and subterfuge, the indictment said.

Swedish Medical Center has asked about 3,000 patients who had surgery between Aug. 17 and Jan. 22 in the main operating rooms and in the orthopedic operating room on Oct. 28 to be tested for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

Tuesday evening, Denver lawyer Jim Avery posted on Twitter that two of his patients had tested positive for hepatitis B. He later told Denver7 that Swedish was trying to suggest they got hepatitis B somewhere else, but the clients did not have hepatitis B before their surgeries at Swedish.

Allen faces one count of tampering with a consumer product that could put him in federal prison for 10 years with up to a $250,000 fine if found guilty.

Allen also faces one count of obtaining a controlled substance by deceit and subterfuge, which could land him, if convicted, in prison for four years with a $250,000 fine.

Federal authorities said the case remains under investigation.

Allen has a second court appearance Friday, when prosecutors will argue he should be held without bail.

Two Arizona hospitals have said they will offer free HIV and hepatitis tests to surgical patients who may have been put at risk by Allen. He also served as a surgical technologist in the Navy.

Allen worked at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale, Ariz., from May 19 to July 2, 2014, spokesman Jeff Nelson said.

Allen also previously worked for HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix before getting fired for a “violation of a workplace policy when he tested positive for use of a controlled substance,” according to the hospital.

On his application to work as a surgical tech in Colorado, Allen answered “no” when asked whether he had ever been fired as a surgical tech.",16/02/2016
The Denver Post,Guest commentary: Jussie Smollett isn’t the reason black LGBT hate-crime victims aren’t believed,"Even before “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was criminally charged for allegedly making a false report that he was the victim of a violent hate crime, the hand-wringing over the damage to the credibility of hate-crime victims had already begun: Observers worried that the case could “cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected,” make it “even harder” for genuine victims to speak up and embolden “those who are inclined to dismiss prejudice in America as a manufactured crisis.” But anyone who’s looking to dismiss prejudice or downplay the targeting of black people in the LGBT community doesn’t need Smollett.

To be clear: If his story is proven to be a hoax, there’s no justification. I’m black and gay, and I was saddened when I heard the initial reports that Smollett said he was attacked. But if he made it all up, I wouldn’t defend him for it. Black LGBT hate-crime victims, though, have always struggled to be believed. To suggest that their credibility turns on whether his story is fabricated is its own kind of hoax.

When I was 21, my best friend, also black and gay, was assaulted outside his home by two men. He was kicked, punched and had his face pounded into the pavement. Passersby saw him and did nothing to stop it or come to his aid. Afterward, he declined to call the police. When I asked why not, he said: Do I look like Matthew Shepard to you? No one’s going to do a documentary on another black (expletive) getting beat up.

My friend’s story isn’t unique. Not even close.

As the Advocate reported last year, in 1992, transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson was found dead in the Hudson River. Her death was initially classified as a suicide, but after LGBT activists investigated further, her cause of death was reclassified as “undetermined.”

A New York man was convicted of manslaughter in 2016 for the 2013 killing of transgender woman Islan Nettles. According to the New York Times, the killer told police he had “flown into ‘a blind fury'” after being taunted by others for talking to a trans woman, but the district attorney declined to charge a hate crime.

In 2012, Mother Jones reported on the case of Crishaun “CeCe” McDonald, who was walking with several people past a group of people at a bar who called her and her friends racist and homophobic expletives before one of the bar patrons hit her in the face with a glass, causing a gash that required stitches. When McDonald was followed by one of the men coming after her group, she turned and confronted him with a pair of scissors that she had pulled from her purse, and he was stabbed and killed. She was defending herself — standing her ground, some would say — but was arrested and later convicted of manslaughter.

“The number of hate crime incidents reported to the FBI increased about 17 percent in 2017,” compared to 2016, according to an FBI report. “According to the report, the most common bias categories in single-bias incidents were race/ethnicity/ancestry (59.6) percent, religion (20.6 percent), and sexual orientation (15.8 percent). In addition to the 7,106 single-bias incidents reported last year, there were also 69 multiple-bias hate crimes reported.”

A 2018 report by California State University, San Bernardino, points out that “since federal record-keeping began, race was the most common category, constituting 57 percent of all hate crimes, with African-Americans being the single most targeted group at 28.4 percent” and “the next most frequent targets involved sexual orientation at 17.6 percent.”

The Human Rights Campaign website states: “According to a 2014 report on hate violence against LGBT and HIV-affected communities, black survivors of hate violence were 1.3 times more likely to experience police violence than their non-black counterparts. Black survivors were also twice as likely to experience any physical violence, twice as likely to experience discrimination and 1.4 times more likely to experience threats and intimidation during acts of hate violence. Additionally, black transgender women face the highest levels of fatal violence within the LGBT community and are less likely to turn to police for help for fear of revictimization by law enforcement personnel.”

And whether LGBT or not, no one should be surprised that there’s skepticism about law enforcement within the black community. Officers from the Chicago Police Department — the primary agency involved in the Smollett investigation — were just acquitted in January of charges that they tried to cover up the 2014 murder of African-American teenager Laquan McDonald by fellow officer Jason Van Dyke, even though those officers were reported to have huddled with Van Dyke right after the killing to sync their stories, all using the same phrase to describe the victim “swinging” a knife, at best a misleading description of what anyone could see for themselves in the dash-cam video released later.

Then there are the well-known stories of accusations leveled at African-Americans that were later found to have been made up: In 1994, for instance, Susan Smith infamously killed her two small children by leaving them in her car and letting it roll into a South Carolina lake — but she initially told police that a black man had taken her car with the children still inside it. A 2017 report noted that “As of October 15, 2016, the National Registry of Exonerations listed 1,900 defendants who were convicted of crimes and later exonerated because they were innocent; 47% of them were African-Americans, three times their rate in the population.” But we rarely say that those who wrongly accuse black people damage the overall credibility of real crime victims.

And there are the well-known instances of people who’ve been given the benefit of the doubt in circumstances where African-Americans might not be: think of George Zimmerman, an armed adult who followed unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin down a dark street in Florida and was found not guilty of murder or manslaughter after claiming he had killed the teenager in self-defense after a scuffle.

Two wrongs don’t make a right, of course. The point isn’t that we should start believing people less if they’re not black or LGBT. I don’t know what happened to Smollett and don’t excuse any lies he may have told. If he lied, he should be prosecuted. But part of the insidiousness of racism in our society is that, too often, black and LGBT people aren’t believed in instances where others are, and then, somehow, the hard-to-believe story of one gay black person is used as an explanation of why that dichotomy persists. Pointing to Smollett as the reason hate-crime victims, particularly LGBT African-Americans, will now be “harder to hear” distracts us from the reality: Not enough of us try to hear them in the first place.

The Denver Post,"New information “has shifted” investigation into Jussie Smollett’s assault claims, Chicago police say","Chicago police say new information in the case involving an alleged assault against Jussie Smollett has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation” and that they want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

In a statement Saturday night, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the information was received in interviews with two individuals who were previously questioned by police and that the department has reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.

Chicago police said last month they were investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime. Smollett told police he was attacked about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance, which he believes was bleach, on him. According to Smollett, at least one assailant told him “this is MAGA country” during the alleged attack.

On Friday, Chicago police said they had arrested two potential suspects on “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.” Guglielmi told The Post that at least one of the two men, who were later released without being charged, has worked on the Fox drama. Guglielmi did not confirm whether the men — who are of Nigerian descent and believed to be the “persons of interest” seen in surveillance images released by police last month — knew Smollett.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said in a tweet Friday night.

The latest police statement comes amid increasing news reports, which cite unnamed police sources, that Smollett may have staged his own attack in the city last month.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” attorneys for the actor said in a statement late Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying … Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Local outlets published reports Thursday evening that questioned the veracity of Smollett’s allegations. CBS Chicago — citing an unnamed “source with intimate knowledge of the investigation” — reported that investigators believe that Smollett and two “non-cooperating witnesses” had staged the attack. ABC7, meanwhile, published a report citing “multiple sources” who told the ABC affiliate that police were investigating whether the actor and the “two persons of interest” had “staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off ‘Empire.’

But in a tweet Thursday night, Guglielmi said the hoax reports were “unconfirmed by case detectives.” He noted that police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who told ABC7 earlier this month that Smollett “had been cooperative” in the investigation, had followed up with them “to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Entertainment also responded to the reports Thursday in a strongly worded statement: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Several of Smollett’s “Empire” colleagues, including co-creator Danny Strong, also denied the show had considered writing off the actor’s character, Jamal Lyon, an openly gay R&B artist.

The hoax reports surfaced on the same day “Good Morning America” aired an interview with Smollett, who talked in detail for the first time about the alleged attack. Smollett appeared emotional as he spoke to ABC’s Robin Roberts. He said he was “pissed off” about the attack — and at critics doubting his account.

“At first, it was like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,’ ” Smollett said. “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’ ”

The actor told Roberts he believed some doubted his story because he said his attackers referenced President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett also said some media reports about his alleged assault were inaccurate. He said he never told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats. “I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

He explained some of the more scrutinized details of the case, including why he didn’t change his clothes or remove the rope from his neck after the attack (“I wanted [the police] to see what this was,” he told Roberts). Smollett also explained his initial hesitation — referenced in the police report — to go to police.

“There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak,” he said. “And I’m not weak. We, as a people, are not weak.”

Outside of acting, Smollett has established himself as an activist, working alongside organizations dedicated to HIV/AIDS awareness, civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy — a background he referenced while addressing the skepticism surrounding his claims.

“I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way,” he told Roberts. “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”

The Denver Post,Could anyone have stopped gene-edited babies experiment?,"HONG KONG — Early last year, a little-known Chinese researcher turned up at an elite meeting in Berkeley, California, where scientists and ethicists were discussing a technology that had shaken the field to its core — an emerging tool for “editing” genes, the strings of DNA that form the blueprint of life.

The young scientist, He Jiankui, saw the power of this tool, called CRISPR, to transform not only genes, but also his own career.

In visits to the United States, he sought out CRISPR pioneers such as Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University’s Dr. Matthew Porteus, and big thinkers on its use, like Stanford ethicist Dr. William Hurlbut.

Last week, those shocked researchers watched as He hijacked an international conference they helped organize with an astonishing claim: He said he helped make the world’s first gene-edited babies , despite clear scientific consensus that making genetic changes that could be passed to future generations should not be attempted at this point .

U.S. National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins called He’s experiment “a misadventure of a major sort” — starring “a scientist who apparently believed that he was a hero. In fact, he crossed every line, scientifically and ethically.”

But nobody stopped him. How can that be?

To be fair, scientists say there’s no certain way to stop someone intent on monkeying with DNA, no matter what laws or standards are in place. CRISPR is cheap and easy to use — which is why scientists began to worry almost as soon as the technology was invented that something like this would happen.

And there is a long history in science and medicine of researchers launching experiments prematurely that were met with scorn or horror — some of which led to what are now common practices, such as in-vitro fertilization.

Gene-editing for reproductive purposes is effectively banned in the U.S. and most of Europe. In China, ministerial guidelines prohibit embryo research that “violates ethical or moral principles.”

It turns out He wasn’t exactly tight-lipped about his goals . He pursued international experts at Stanford and Rice Universities, where he had done graduate studies work, and elsewhere, seeking advice before and during the experiment.

Should scientists who knew of He’s plans have spoken up? Could they have dissuaded him?

The answers aren’t clear.

“It doesn’t fall into the category of legal responsibility, but ethical responsibility,” said Collins. He said that not speaking up “doesn’t seem like a scientist taking responsibility.”

China’s National Commission of Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences and He’s own university have said they were in dark and have since condemned him .

But three Stanford scientists — Hurlbut, Porteus and He’s former fellowship adviser, Stephen Quake — had extensive contact with him over the last few years. They and other scientists knew or strongly suspected that He intended to try to make genetically edited babies.

Some confidantes didn’t think He would follow through; others raised concerns that were never heeded.

Stanford has not responded to an interview request.

Quake, a bioengineering professor, was one of the first to know about He’s ambition. Quake said he had met with He through the years whenever his former student was in town, and that He confided his interest a few years ago in editing embryos for live births to try to make them resistant to the AIDS virus.

Quake said he gave He only general advice and encouraged him to talk with mainstream scientists, to choose situations where there’s consensus that the risks are justified, to meet the highest ethics standards and to publish his results in a peer-reviewed journal.

“My advice was very broad,” Quake said.

Hurlbut thinks he first met He in early 2017, when he and Doudna, co-inventor of CRISPR, held the first of three meetings with leading scientists and ethicists to discuss the technology.

“Somehow, he ended up at our meeting,” Hurlbut said.

Since then, He returned several times to Stanford, and Hurlbut said he “spent many hours” talking with He about situations where gene editing might be appropriate.

Four or five weeks ago, Hurlbut said He came to see him again and discussed embryo gene editing to try to prevent HIV. Hurlbut said he suspected He had tried to implant a modified embryo in a woman’s womb.

“I admonished him,” he said. “I didn’t green-light his work. I challenged him on it. I didn’t approve of what he was doing.”

Porteus said he knew that He had been talking with Hurlbut and assumed Hurlbut discouraged the Chinese scientist. In February, He asked to meet with Porteus and told him he had gotten approval from a hospital ethics board to move forward.

“I think he was expecting me to be more receptive, and I was very negative,” Porteus said. “I was angry at his naivete, I was angry at his recklessness.”

Porteus said he urged He “to go talk to your senior Chinese colleagues.”

After that meeting, “I didn’t hear from him and assumed he would not proceed,” Porteus said. “In retrospect, I could have raised a hue and cry.”

In a draft article about the gene-edited twin girls, which He planned to submit to journals, he thanked UC Berkeley biophysicist Mark DeWitt for “editing the manuscript.” DeWitt said he tried to dissuade He and disputed that he edited the paper. He said he saw the paper, but the feedback he offered was “pretty general.”

He’s claims, including that his work has resulted in a second pregnancy , cannot be independently confirmed and his work has not been published. He defended his actions last week at a gene editing summit in Hong Kong.

In contrast, another U.S. scientist said he not only encouraged He but played a large role in the project.

Michael Deem, a bioengineering professor at Rice University and He’s doctoral degree adviser, said he had worked with He since the scientist returned to China around 2012, and that he sits on the advisory boards and holds “a small stake” in He’s two genetics companies in Shenzhen. Deem defended He’s actions, saying the research team did earlier experiments on animals.

“We have multiple generations of animals that were genetically edited and produced viable offspring,” and a lot of research on unintended effects on other genes, Deem said. Deem also said he was present in China when some study participants gave their consent to try embryo gene editing.

Rice said it had no knowledge of Deem’s involvement and is now investigating.

So far most of the attention has focused on regulatory gaps in China.

But that’s not the whole story, said Rosario Isasi, an expert on genomics law in the U.S. and China at the University of Miami.

“Let’s focus on how it happened and why it happened, and the way it happened,” said Isasi. “How can we establish a system that has better transparency?”

There’s no international governing body to enforce bioethics rules, but scientific bodies and universities can use other tools.

“If someone breaks those rules, scientists can ostracize, journals can refuse to publish, employers can refuse to employ, funders can refuse to fund,” said Hank Greely, a professor of law and genetics at Stanford.

Greely expects He’s experiment will have ripple effects in academia, whether or not regulators act. “Universities are going to take a harder look at what’s going on. This incident will put everyone on alert about any related research.”

Of course, sometimes bad beginnings can turn into better endings.

In 1980, University of California, Los Angeles, professor Martin Cline was sanctioned for performing the first gene therapy on two women in Israel and Italy because he hadn’t gotten approval to try it at UCLA.

Cline announced his work rather than publishing it in a scientific journal, and faced criticism for trying “genetic engineering” on people when its safety and effectiveness hadn’t yet been established in animals. Now gene therapy is an established, although still fairly novel, treatment method.

Two years earlier, in 1978, Dr. Robert Edwards was similarly denounced when he announced through the press the world’s first “test tube baby,” Louise Brown. The work later earned a Nobel Prize, and IFV has helped millions to have a child.

And this year, Louise Brown — mother of two sons, conceived in the old-fashioned way — turned 40.

The Denver Post,Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect indicted as funerals continue,"PITTSBURGH — The suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday, four days after 11 people were killed and six wounded in the deadliest attack on Jews in American history.

The indictment, which was expected, charges Robert Bowers with 44 counts, including hate crimes. Federal prosecutors have previously indicated they plan to seek the death penalty. The charges were announced on the second day of funerals for the victims.

“Today begins the process of seeking justice for the victims of these hateful acts, and healing for the victims’ families, the Jewish community, and our city,” U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said in a statement. “Our office will spare no resource, and will work with professionalism, integrity and diligence, in a way that honors the memories of the victims.”

Bowers, a 46-year-old truck driver, remained jailed without bail ahead of a preliminary hearing scheduled for Thursday. Authorities say he raged against Jews during the attack.

Members of Pittsburgh’s grief-stricken Jewish community, meanwhile, endured another round of funerals for the congregants who were gunned down in Saturday’s rampage.

Melvin Wax, 87, Irving Younger, 69, and Joyce Fienberg, 75, were being laid to rest as part of a weeklong series of services.

“It can’t be fixed,” Robert Libman said at the funeral of Fienberg, his sister, clutching his chest as he described the pain of losing her. “My sister is dead. My sister was murdered. There was no one I know like her. Pure goodness. … She was the most tolerant and gentle person that I’ve ever known.”

Her sons, Anthony, of Paris, and Howard, of Vienna, Virginia, said she spent five years caring for their father as he battled cancer, then after his death a few years ago, devoted more of her time and energy to Tree of Life.

“My mom would be very angry that her funeral wasn’t able to be at Tree of Life, and that her friends lost Saturday couldn’t be here,” Howard Fienberg said.

The funerals for Wax and Younger were to be held later Tuesday.

Six people were wounded in the attack, including four police officers, two of whom remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds. Two congregants were still in the hospital, one in critical condition.

In a bit of good news, hospital officials said the two most seriously injured shooting victims are improving.

A police officer and a congregant remain in intensive care but “are doing much better now,” Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at UPMC, said Wednesday. “I think overall the prognoses are good now. But each of them, in a varying way, will have a different trajectory and likely will require a series of ongoing care.”

The first three funerals were held on Tuesday, with thousands of mourners jamming a synagogue, a Jewish community center and a third, undisclosed site for the funerals of a beloved family doctor, a pillar of the congregation, and two intellectually disabled brothers in the 50s who were known as “the boys.”

Cecil and David Rosenthal were “beautiful souls” who had “not an ounce of hate in them — something we’re terribly missing today,” Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, a survivor of the massacre, said at their funeral at Rodef Shalom, one of the city’s oldest and largest synagogues.

The brothers were both active at Tree of Life, with Cecil the more gregarious of the two, a man with a booming voice who was known as the “mayor” of the city’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood and the “town crier” for the gossip he managed to gather.

“They were innocent like boys, not hardened like men,” the Rosenthals’ sister, Diane Hirt, told mourners.

On Tuesday afternoon, after the day’s funerals were over, Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived in Pittsburgh to shouting, chanting protesters with signs such as “It’s your fault” and “Words matter,” a reference to allegations that Trump’s combative language has emboldened bigots. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, both Democrats, declined to join him during the visit.

“He didn’t pull the trigger, but his verbiage and actions don’t help,” said Squirrel Hill resident Paul Carberry, 55, wearing anti-Trump patches on his hat and jacket.

Another Squirrel Hill resident, Shayna Marcus, a Jewish 34-year-old nurse and Trump supporter who hoped to catch sight of the presidential motorcade, said: “I don’t think focusing on Trump is the answer, or on politics.”

One person was arrested during the protests.

During their visit, Trump and the first lady lit candles at Tree of Life for the victims and laid white roses as well as stones for each of the dead, a Jewish burial tradition. They later went to a hospital to visit with survivors.

They were joined by Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, as well as Myers, the Tree of Life rabbi, and Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer.

A private funeral was conducted Tuesday for Daniel Stein, the 71-year-old men’s club president at Tree of Life. And a service with more than 1,000 people was held for Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz at the Jewish Community Center in Squirrel Hill.

The 66-year-old Rabinowitz was a go-to doctor for HIV patients in the epidemic’s early and desperate days, a physician who always hugged his patients as they left his office.

“A lot of people are feeling really angry about this. A lot of rage built up inside about this, because of it being a hate crime. Don’t get me wrong; I do. But I’m so overwhelmed with sadness right now that I can’t even be angry right now,” said Robin Faulkner, whose family had seen Rabinowitz for 30 years and counted him as a dear friend. “It’s just such a loss. Just tragic.”

Among the mourners at the Rosenthal brothers’ funeral was Dr. Abe Friedman, who typically sat in the back row of Tree of Life with the two men but was late to synagogue on Saturday and was not there when the gunman opened fire.

As he stood in line at the funeral, Friedman wondered why he had been spared.

“Why did things fall into place for me?” he asked. “I usually sit in the back row. In the last row, everyone got killed.”

The Denver Post,"Decriminalize all drug use for a better world, these medical experts say","A group of 22 medical experts convened by Johns Hopkins University and The Lancet have called for the decriminalization of all nonviolent drug use and possession. Citing a growing scientific consensus on the failures of the global war on drugs, the experts further encourage countries and U.S. states to move gradually toward regulated drug markets and apply the scientific method to their assessment.

Their report comes ahead of a special UN General Assembly Session on drugs to be held next month, where the world s countries will re-evaluate the past half-century of drug policy and, in the hope of many experts, chart a more public-health-centered approach going forward.

Drug policy in the 21st century

In a lengthy review of the state of global drug policy, the Hopkins-Lancet experts conclude that the prohibitionist anti-drug policies of the past 50 years directly and indirectly contribute to lethal violence, disease, discrimination, forced displacement, injustice and the undermining of people s right to health. They cite, among other things:

A striking increase in homicide in Mexico since the government decided to militarize its response to the drug trade in 2006. The increase has been so great that experts have had to revise life expectancy downward in that country;

The excessive use of incarceration as a drug control measure, which the experts identify as the biggest contribution to higher rates of HIV and Hepatitis C infection among drug users;

Stark racial disparities in drug law enforcement, particularly in the United States;

And human rights violations arising from excessively punitive drug control measures, including an increase in the torture and abuse of drug prisoners in places like Mexico.

The goal of prohibiting all use, possession, production and trafficking of illicit drugs is the basis of many of our national drug laws, but these policies are based on ideas about drug use and drug dependence that are not scientifically grounded, said Commissioner Chris Beyrer of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a statement.

For instance, the last time the UN held a special session on drugs, in 1998, it set itself the goal of a drug-free world by 2008. The Hopkins-Lancet commissioners also fault UN drug regulators for failing to distinguish between drug use and drug abuse. The idea that all drug use is dangerous and evil has led to enforcement-heavy policies and has made it difficult to see potentially dangerous drugs in the same light as potentially dangerous foods, tobacco and alcohol, for which the goal of social policy is to reduce potential harms, they write.

The commissioners cite research showing that of an estimated 246 million people who used an illicit drug in the past year, 27 million (around 11%) experienced problem drug use, which was defined as drug dependence or drug-use disorders.

The idea that all drug use is necessarily abuse means that immediate and complete abstinence has been seen as the only acceptable approach, commissioner Adeeba Kamarulzaman, a professor at the University of Malaya, said in a statement. But, she added, continued criminalization of drug use fuels HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis transmission within prisons and the community at large. There is another way. Programmes and policies aimed at reducing harm should be central to future drug policies.

The commissioners point to successes in drug decriminalization experiments in places like Portugal, where drug use rates have fallen, overdose deaths are rare and new HIV infections among drug users have plummeted. They recommend that other countries adopt a similar approach.

And beyond decriminalization, the commissioners recommend experimenting with the full legalization and regulation of certain types of drug use, as several U.S. states have done with marijuana.

Although regulated legal drug markets are not politically possible in the short term in some places, the harms of criminal markets and other consequences of prohibition catalogued in this Commission will probably lead more countries (and more U.S. states) to move gradually in that direction — a direction we endorse, they write.

Other countries, particularly in Latin America, are already looking toward U.S. marijuana legalization experiments as a blueprint for how they might move away from overly punitive drug laws. But one challenge toward adopting a less stringent drug policy has always been the massive UN drug control treaties, which are now decades-old and which experts say reflect outdated and even harmful ways of thinking about drug use.

Reformers are hoping that the upcoming General Assembly Special Session on drugs will mark a turning point in the drug war. But getting nearly 200 countries to agree on any change in direction will be a challenge. And early indications appear to be that negotiators are setting their sights low.

A draft document of the resolution to be discussed at the special session reaffirms the UN s commitment to the goals and objectives of the three international drug control conventions — the same conventions criticized in the Hopkins-Lancet report. And it calls on countries to actively promote a society free of drug abuse, echoing the language of the failed drug control goals of the 1990s.",29/03/2016
The Denver Post,U.S. approves first prescription drug made from marijuana,"WASHINGTON — U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use.

The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy that begin in childhood. But it’s not quite medical marijuana.

The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant — but not the one that gets users high. It’s not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.

British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.

[ State of Hope: The Denver Post’s in-depth look at CBD in Colorado ]

FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs.

The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.

Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. But it doesn’t contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.

Physicians say it’s important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.

[ Special Report: CBD, TBD; Part I || Forbidden medicine: Caught between a doctor’s CBD advice and federal laws ]

“I’m really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,” said Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic’s program for childhood epilepsy. “In the artisanal products there’s often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.”

Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.

Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.

“I preferred this to some of those other options because it’s is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,” said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.

Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer “drop” seizures — in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.

CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.

The impact of Monday’s approval on these products is unclear.

The FDA has issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer’s. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.

Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.

Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.

“I don’t know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what’s already working,” said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation’s largest CBD companies. “I really don’t think it’s going to affect us much.”

Jackson’s group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.

[ Game of Pain: Why Jake Plummer and others are pushing for research on CBD’s benefits to NFL players ]

A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.

For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.

The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.

The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.

Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.

Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.

Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.

GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances.",25/06/2018
The Denver Post,Correction: Obit-Heimlich story,"CINCINNATI (AP) — In a story Dec. 17 about the death of Dr. Henry Heimlich, The Associated Press erroneously reported the year the U.S. Navy sent him to northwest China. It was 1945, not 1942.

The AP also reported the American Heart Association backs abdominal thrusts in choking cases. The story should have made clear that the association stresses that such thrusts should not be used on infants or unconscious victims.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Henry Heimlich, life-saving maneuver creator, dies at 96

The surgeon who created the life-saving Heimlich maneuver for choking victims died early Saturday in Cincinnati

By LISA CORNWELL

Associated Press

CINCINNATI (AP) — The surgeon who created the life-saving Heimlich maneuver for choking victims died early Saturday in Cincinnati. Dr. Henry Heimlich was 96.

His son, Phil, said he died at Christ Hospital after suffering a heart attack earlier in the week.

“My father was a great man who saved many lives,” said Heimlich, an attorney and former Hamilton County commissioner. “He will be missed not only by his family but by all of humanity.”

Heimlich was director of surgery at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati in 1974 when he devised the treatment for choking victims that made his name a household word.

Rescuers using the procedure abruptly squeeze a victim’s abdomen, pushing in and above the navel with the fist to create a flow of air from the lungs. That flow of air then can push objects out of the windpipe and prevent suffocation.

Much of Heimlich’s 2014 autobiography focuses on the maneuver, which involves thrusts to the abdomen that apply upward pressure on the diaphragm to create an air flow that forces food or other objects out of the windpipe.

The Cincinnati chest surgeon told The Associated Press in a February 2014 interview that thousands of deaths reported annually from choking prompted him in 1972 to seek a solution. During the next two years, he led a team of researchers at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. He successfully tested the technique by putting a tube with a balloon at one end down an anesthetized dog’s airway until it choked. He then used the maneuver to force the dog to expel the obstruction.

The Wilmington, Delaware, native estimated the maneuver has saved the lives of thousands of choking victims in the United States alone. It earned him several awards and worldwide recognition. His name became a household word.

The maneuver was adopted by public health authorities, airlines and restaurant associations, and Heimlich appeared on shows including the “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” and “The Today Show.”

His views on how the maneuver should be used and on other innovations he created or proposed put him at odds with some in the health field. He said his memoir was an effort to preserve his technique.

“I know the maneuver saves lives, and I want it to be used and remembered,” he told the AP. “I felt I had to have it down in print so the public will have the correct information.”

The maneuver has continued to make headlines. Clint Eastwood was attending a golf event in Monterey, California, in 2014 when the then-83-year-old actor saw the tournament director choking on a piece of cheese and successfully performed the technique.

“The best thing about it is that it allows anyone to save a life,” Heimlich told the AP.

In 2016, Heimlich himself was the hero, saving a woman choking on food at his senior living center.

Heimlich said the maneuver is very effective when used correctly, but he did not approve of American Red Cross guidelines calling for back blows followed by abdominal thrusts in choking cases that don’t involve infants or unconscious victims. Red Cross officials said evidence shows using multiple methods can be more effective, but Heimlich said blows can drive obstructions deeper into a windpipe. The American Heart Association backs abdominal thrusts, while stressing that they should not be used on infants or unconscious victims.

Neither organization supports Heimlich’s view that using the maneuver to remove water from the lungs could save drowning victims. They recommend CPR.

Heimlich was proud of some of his other innovations, such as a chest drain valve credited by some with saving soldiers and civilians during the Vietnam War. But he drew sharp criticism for his theory that injecting patients with a curable form of malaria could trigger immunity in patients with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Medical experts have said injecting patients with malaria would be dangerous and have criticized Heimlich for conducting studies involving malariotherapy on HIV patients in China.

Heimlich mostly brushed off critics.

“I’ll be the first to admit that a number of my ideas are controversial and in some ways unorthodox,” Heimlich told the AP. “But I have enough guts to know that when I am right, it will come about as the thing to do, even if others do the wrong thing for a time.”

One of his most vocal critics has been his son, Peter Heimlich. The younger Heimlich split with his father years ago over a personal rift. He initially circulated anonymous criticisms of his father before openly speaking out against him online and in media interviews.

Peter Heimlich has called many of his father’s theories dangerous and spent years challenging many of his claims and trying to discredit them. The elder Heimlich maintained that his relationship with his son was a family matter refused to comment on it to the media.

The elder Heimlich attended Cornell University undergraduate and medical schools and interned at Boston City Hospital. During World War II, the U.S. Navy sent him to northwest China in 1945 to treat Chinese and American forces behind Japanese lines in the Gobi Desert.

Beginning in the 1950s, he held staff surgeon positions at New York’s Metropolitan Hospital and Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center. He later was an attending surgeon on the staffs at Jewish and Deaconess hospitals in Cincinnati and a researcher at his nonprofit Heimlich Institute.

Heimlich’s wife Jane, daughter of the late dance teacher Arthur Murray, died in November 2012.

He is survived by two sons and two daughters.

Phil Heimlich said a private family service and burial is planned soon. The family hopes to arrange a public memorial, he added, that will give his father’s friends and admirers a chance to pay their respects.

The Denver Post,Where does Colorado baker Jack Phillips’ religious freedom end and discrimination begin? Here’s what legal experts say.,"WASHINGTON — Colorado baker Jack Phillips wants to start making wedding cakes again, but court experts are far from united on what kind of legal landscape he would face if he once more refused to do work for a same-sex couple — despite his victory this week in the U.S. Supreme Court.

Some lawyers argued that Phillips’ actions remain discriminatory and that he needs to proceed carefully. Others saw the high-court ruling as leaving open a doorway for greater leverage of religion into corporate and civic life.

All agreed, however, that the question at the heart of the Phillips’ case — where freedom of religion ends and discrimination begins — remains unanswered, and that both the marketplace and court system will continue to wrestle with that conflict for the immediate future.

For his part, Phillips said in two television appearances Tuesday that he hoped to return to the wedding industry after a six-year legal battle that started when he declined to make a cake in 2012 for fiancés Charlie Craig and David Mullins.

Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop: “The response of the community has been overwhelmingly supportive.” https://t.co/c0TyTMS5jl pic.twitter.com/8lcopJMmWE — Fox News (@FoxNews) June 5, 2018

“One of the main reasons (I got into baking) is because I love doing wedding cakes,” Phillips said on “Fox & Friends.”

But even Phillips seemed unsure whether he could move forward legally in the way that he planned.

“We’re just looking forward to hopefully getting back into the wedding business and we’ll see how the court ruling affects that,” said Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood.

Alan Chen, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, said if he were Phillips’ lawyer, he would “certainly think twice before advising him to return to his practice of turning away gay and lesbian couples who want to hire him to design a wedding cake.”

He cited Justice Anthony Kennedy’s opinion in which he wrote that it was “unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.”

Said Chen: “The Supreme Court did not say that persons with religious objections are categorically exempt from laws prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination.”

Speaking to the high court decision, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman said the ruling left open several legal questions. But the one-time candidate for governor said it in no way undermined the state’s anti-discrimination act.

“The court did make clear, however, that states like Colorado may continue to protect the LGBTQ community, reaffirming principles my office has consistently defended for the past six years,” she said. “The general rule was, and remains, that the First Amendment does not allow business owners to deny members of the community equal access to goods and services.”

James Esseks, director of the LGBT and HIV Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, took it one step farther.

“The Supreme Court gave the bakery a get-out-of-jail-free card (Monday), but it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card that has a one-time-only use,” Esseks said. “The bakery was asking for a constitutional right to discriminate, and it didn’t get that.”

Byron Henry, an appellate attorney with Scheef & Stone in Dallas, sees another wrinkle in the high court ruling. While he agrees it doesn’t undermine Colorado’s anti-discrimination law, he contended that it gives business owners more space to hold to seriously held convictions when it involves communicating a message or a form of artistic expression.

“Expressive conduct is the key here,” he said.

That means that a hardware store can’t refuse to sell woods and nails to someone building a gazebo for a same-sex marriage or other event they disagree with. And business owners can’t refuse to transact business with someone simply because of their sexual orientation.

“Phillips should fare well in the court if he holds to the same practice consistently — sells to everyone, makes cakes for everyone, gay or straight, but not to celebrate gay marriage,” Henry said.

Although same-sex ceremonies are at the center of many cases, broader protections for expressive conduct open up a host of questions and scenarios. Nor did the court call providing a cake, on which the case centered, “expressive conduct.”

Future rulings are needed to flesh out the broader context, and those are coming. “We will see more cases come out of the appellate courts in the next six to eight months,” Henry said.

Eric Rassbach, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said the biggest change to come out of the Masterpiece Cakeshop case has little to do with the actions of shopkeepers.

Instead, he said government officials would be most impacted.

The reason has to do with how the court reached the 7-2 decision. Kennedy, in his ruling, essentially punted on the main legal conflict by focusing his judgment on the behavior of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which he described as unfairly hostile to Phillips’ religious beliefs.

Because of that, the strikes against Phillips were rendered moot.

Rassbach said that approach by the high court means that government officials could face more scrutiny for the way in which they debate policies that involve religion. A hypothetical example, he said, would be disparaging comments about religion, or a specific religion, made by a City Council member during a debate over the zoning of a church or mosque.

“There is much more of a legal price to pay for what you could call political grandstanding,” said Rassbach, whose group has played a key role in major religious cases such as the 2014 Hobby Lobby decision.",06/06/2018
The Denver Post,“When AIDS Was Funny” movie review: A sobering window into the Reagan administration,"In honor of this past Tuesday’s World AIDS Day — an annual campaign to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS, honor those who have died and elevate the hope of an AIDS-free future generation — a new documentary film offers a revealing look back at the early 1980s and the Reagan administration’s initial reaction to the emerging AIDS crisis.

Filmmaker Scott Calonico’s short documentary, “When AIDS Was Funny,” debuted Tuesday on the Vanity Fair website and features previously unpublished audio from news conferences where reporter Lester Kinsolving implored Reagan administration press secretary Larry Speakes to address the mounting cases of AIDS nationwide.

(The film can be viewed at vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/reagan-administration-response-to-aids-crisis.)

The first exchange in the film, recorded in 1982, when AIDS-related deaths in the United States numbered in the hundreds, sets a clear tone: “Larry, does the president have any reaction to the announcement by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta that A-I-D-S is now an epidemic in over 600 cases?” Kinsolving asks, spelling out the acronym.

Speakes appears dumbfounded. “A-I-D-S? I haven’t got anything on it.”

Kinsolving elaborates: “It’s known as ‘gay plague.’ “

At this, the media pool dissolves into laughter.

Kinsolving’s tone remains grave. “No, it is,” he says. “It’s a pretty serious thing. One in every three people that get this have died, and I wonder if the president is aware of this?”

Speakes doesn’t answer the question, but offers up a joke instead: “I don’t have it,” he says. “Do you?”

At subsequent news conferences, in 1983 and 1984, Speakes — and the White House news corps — continue to respond to Kinsolving’s increasingly urgent questions about AIDS with a mix of laughter, homophobic jokes and general indifference.

It’s no secret that Ronald Reagan’s response to the HIV/AIDS crisis left a blot on his presidential record; by the time he finally addressed the epidemic in earnest — in 1987 — nearly 23,000 people had died of the disease. Although Reagan ultimately labeled AIDS “public health enemy No. 1,” he also suggested that its spread might be slowed by ethical behavior — i.e., abstinence. “After all, when it comes to preventing AIDS, don’t medicine and morality teach the same lessons?” he said, according to The New York Times.

But in 2015, when the CDC reports that more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV and the total number of AIDS-related deaths nationwide tops 658,000, the video offers a new and troubling glimpse at how a major public health crisis went unaddressed for so long.",03/12/2015
The Denver Post,University of Colorado Hospital opens new LGBT mental health clinic,"The first time Robert Davies mentioned to a therapist that he might be gay, she asked if he wanted to accept that or have it “fixed.”

Davies, now a psychiatrist and associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, did not talk about his sexuality again for years. His mission these days is to make it easier for other LGBT people to find mental health and medical care free of judgment or fear.

“The importance of just being able to go see someone for therapy, without any fear of how you are going to be perceived and if they are going to reject you, is a huge thing,” said Dr. Davies, who is vice chair of education in the medical school’s psychiatry department.

Last week, the new UCHealth LGBTQ Clinic opened at University of Colorado Hospital, a first-of-its-kind clinic in this state. The clinic provides mental health care, but can help patients create a network of medical care with doctors who are accepting and experienced in health issues for transgender people and gay men and women.

A sign in the waiting room says “I am,” followed by the words “gay, straight, trans,” all crossed out. “A person,” it ends.

Davies first thought of opening the clinic after reading a One Colorado report that found more than half of gay and trans people surveyed were afraid of how doctors would treat them when they found out they were LGBT. Nearly 30 percent of the 1,200 surveyed said their sexual orientation had prevented them from seeking medical or mental health care. Gay and trans people are also more likely to die by suicide. “There were so many people in this community who simply avoided health care because they assumed they were going to have a bad experience,” Davies said.

The statistics stuck in Davies’ head as he preached to his psychiatry residents that they should “find their passion,” seek outreach work and avoid thinking of psychiatry as a 9-to-5 job. One of his interns spoke about her plans to help the LGBT community. “It dawned on me that I needed to do something about one of my passions,” he said.

Psychiatry residents and faculty at the clinic will offer the psychological evaluations often required by surgeons before gender reassignment surgeries, as well as group therapy for families of transgender people. The clinic also has mental health services for people who are HIV positive and people — from adolescents to senior citizens — who are coming out as gay to friends and family.

Patients will get wellness assessments to see if they have primary care doctors or need help finding one with LGBT-related medical experience. The clinic can connect patients to HIV specialists and endocrinologists for hormone therapy on the Anschutz campus in Aurora. For trans people who have transitioned from female to male, finding a gynecologist is among the most daunting tasks.

Owen Ziegler, a patient of Davies who began his transition to male three years ago, has avoided making that appointment because he doesn’t want to answer waiting room questions about why a man is at the gynecologist.

Ziegler, 24, said his problems with depression and anxiety are biological, but also related to “living in a society that does not have space for you.” When he tried to end his life at age 23, he ended up in a Colorado Springs mental health clinic where he was treated “sort of like an alien.” That was before Ziegler had medically transitioned to male, and some of the clinic staff did not use male pronouns or his preferred name. They didn’t give him a roommate because they didn’t know whether to bunk him with a man or a woman.

“They didn’t know what to do with me,” Ziegler said. “I felt like I was being treated like less human, like I needed to be separated from everyone else because they didn’t know who I was.”

Besides the clinic, the medical school’s psychiatry department also has changed its curriculum in recent years to train residents in LGBT mental health care. The course, created by Davies about five years ago, is now required.

The point is to change the thinking that all people develop the same way, that, for example, adolescence is when all people develop a strong sense of identity. For a gay teenager, adolescence is often about “hiding who you are and developing an identity that is acceptable to people around you,” Davies said. Not understanding the difference in those experiences can cause mental health professionals to “pathologize things they don’t understand,” meaning it is seen as a symptom of an illness instead of a different life experience.

Third-year psychiatry residents will staff the clinic, along with several faculty from the psychiatry department. Social workers and psychologists also will see patients.",08/07/2016
The Denver Post,"A custodian at CSU told a student he was raising money to build schools in his native Uganda, so she offered to help. They’ve raised over $30,000","Lots of students and professors know Robert Serunjogi, a smiling custodian who sweeps and scrubs the hallways and classrooms at Colorado State University. The amiable, 48-year-old Serunjogi chats with many of them every school day.

But premed student Laura Schreck was especially struck by a conversation she had with Serunjogi three years ago while waiting inside CSU’s engineering building for a ride. He told her he was trying to raise money to build schools in his home country of Uganda, where civil war and AIDS have orphaned many children.

“Robert was dumping some trash and he started telling me what was going on with his village,” Schreck said. “And I just couldn’t say ‘Well, that’s too bad. See you later.’

“I had to do something,” she said.

Schreck told Serunjogi about online fundraising and offered to help him set up a campaign and spread word about his desire to build schools in Luweero, his village.

Within three months, the pair had raised $9,000. The donations have continued to flow in, hitting $34,000 so far, including $19,500 through GoFundMe, $9,000 from the Little Shop of Physics at CSU, and another $5,000 from private donations from schools, churches and individuals.

Two school buildings have been built in Luweero and next summer, staff from CSU’s Little Shop of Physics — which encourages hands-on science teaching for young kids — plan to go to the village.

“Robert knows everybody on the CSU campus, so naturally we want to help him in any way we can,” Little Shop of Physics director Brian Jones said. “He’s a great guy. People love him.”

But Serunjogi says there would be no schools without Schreck, who he describes as his “fairy godmother,” “hero” and “best friend.” One of the schools has a plaque on it dedicated to her.

Serunjogi said he initially hoped to raise about $500 for school supplies, clothing and personal hygiene items.

But when he went to Luweero in 2015 with $9,000, village leaders gave approval for a school to be built. (The village still has no running water and families cook with firewood.)

His aunt and nephew helped mobilize about 18 young people to help build the first school. It took about six weeks and involved hand mixing concrete for the foundation and walls.

After Serunjogi returned to Fort Collins, the photos of what they’d accomplished spurred more donations, including $1,000 for glass windows and $500 for musical instruments raised by Johnson Elementary School in Fort Collins.

The bulk of the second building was completed by spring 2017.

“That wouldn’t have happened without Laura,” he said.

“It’s pretty embarrassing,” the 23-year-old graduate of Monarch High School in Louisville said. But there is little doubt she is pivotal in sharing Serunjogi’s story beyond the boundaries of CSU.

She helps him with e-mails, computer skills and financial tasks. Serunjogi’s heavy accent makes it hard for strangers to understand him, so Schreck acts as his interpreter. She meets with potential donors and gives presentations on his behalf.

Schreck carries a huge academic workload, working toward her master’s degree in health and exercise science with the hope of entering medical school in fall 2019.

But she finds Serunjogi’s efforts for his village so compelling she can’t turn away.

“Robert and his story, work ethic and love for his community is what I admire and the reason I can do all of this,” she said.

Serunjogi was only 12 when his father was killed in the civil war that roiled the country after President Idi Amin was overthrown. When he was 16, rebels bombed his village and all of the residents fled, except for Serunjogi, whose mobility is limited because he had polio.

Government soldiers arrived, found him and took him to their barracks. Because it wasn’t safe there, a soldier took Serunjogi to another village, where his uncle eventually found him. A month after he left, bombs hit the barracks.

“There’s a reason God saved my life,” Serunjogi said.

In 1996, Serunjogi met an American woman who worked for Heifer International, a group that works to end hunger around the world. They lived in Uganda for about a year and then moved to the U.S. and got married.

They road tripped around America and when they stopped in Fort Collins, they decided to stay. Serunjogi earned his GED and began taking college courses at CSU, earning an undergraduate degree in political science.

After his wife died of cancer in 2000, Serunjogi continued to work at CSU and got a second job, at a McDonald’s. He also is working toward a master’s degree in education.

This week he returned to Uganda to inspect the work that has been done in his village.

The schools teach academic subjects, but also serve as public health centers where villagers are instructed on HIV prevention and they get vaccines against malaria, smallpox, measles and polio.

The work has given him local-hero status in Luweero. “I think they believe I have done pretty well,” he said.

Schreck credits Serunjogi for showing her how to not to give in to despair.

“He has every right to feel like the world owes him something, or be bitter about what has happened to him,” she said. “He has not done either, but just the opposite by giving up time, sleep and money to try to give back.

“There is a lesson to be learned here,” she said.",28/05/2018
The Denver Post,The Dalai Lama’s doctor asked this Lafayette nonprofit to help Tibet compile hepatitis data,"The Dalai Lama’s personal physician requested help from the Center for Disease Analysis Foundation to gather data on how hepatitis impacts Tibet, but until recently, many Colorado health professionals had no idea that an organization called on worldwide to track the spread and treatment of the disease was in their own backyard.

“I said, ‘Wait, where are they? Who are they?’ ” Nancy Steinfurth, the executive director of Denver nonprofit Liver Health Connection, recounted when a few years ago she heard of CDAF’s home base in a Lafayette office park.

After meeting and working with the center, Steinfurth is happy to rave about the nonprofit whose computer modeling provides countries with hepatitis-related data — how many people in their country have the illness, how many are being treated, how much would it cost to put together a treatment plan — to reach the World Health Organization’s goal of eradicating hepatitis B and C by 2030.

The cost of doing nothing, argues CDAF senior director Rick Dunn, is higher than treatment plans as people in the prime of their lives end up out of work with liver cancer. Dunn and managing director Homie Razavi have used data analysis to persuade dozens of countries to treat — and ultimately eradicate — hepatitis for the good of their health and economy.

“You’ve never heard of us,” said Razavi. “But we’re actually really famous outside of the U.S.”

The small foundation and its spinoff initiatives, such as the data-crunching Polaris Observatory and funding-focused Global Procurement Fund, work with more than 100 countries, providing them the data they need to make informed decisions about the treatment of hepatitis B and C.

Hepatitis B is a liver infection contracted through blood, semen or other bodily fluids from an infected person via shared drug-injection equipment or sexual contact, or contracted during childbirth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Hepatitis C, also a liver infection, is caused by a blood-borne virus transmitted from shared needles or other drug-injecting equipment, the CDC said.

In Colorado, CDAF in 2015 estimated between 54,566 and 109,131 people had hepatitis C. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment received about 4,000 new reports of chronic hepatitis C every year across urban and rural areas, with increasing numbers in recent years.

“There are still more than four times more people living with HCV (hepatitis C) infection in Colorado, compared to HIV infection,” read a 2017 CDAF report.

When CDAF started in 2012, Razavi thought it could provide policymakers with health data on myriad diseases.

The team, now a dozen strong, carved out a niche studying hepatitis when they realized how many people were affected by the disease and how little was being done to address it, Razavi said.

“Every 30 seconds, someone dies of hepatitis B,” Razavi said. “There’s incredibly low awareness about it, but you can actually do something about it. So we did.”

Anti-viral drugs to treat the diseases — and, in hepatitis C’s case, often cure it — are available. Vaccines for hepatitis B exist. Screenings for hepatitis can catch the disease early and prevent escalation to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis or liver cancer.

“The cures exist. The data exists. Why don’t we see more countries taking action? For a relatively small amount of money, you can cure this,” Dunn said.

Brazil’s Ministry of Health used CDAF data to determine that fewer Brazilians were infected by hepatitis C than previously thought. Instead of the estimated 1.6 million cases, data showed the number of infected people was closer to 657,000, meaning it would cost less to work toward eliminating the disease.

“The work we do with CDAF is very important because it helps us to better evaluate the costs of strategies to eliminate hepatitis,” said Maria Cassia Mendes-Correa, an associate professor of infectious diseases at San Paulo University School of Medicine. “It’s very important to understand how the epidemic is going on in our country by knowing the numbers of people that have the disease and the costs involved, and exploring strategies to manage it all for less money.”

CDAF’s Global Procurement Fund has secured generic hepatitis C medication for as little as $120 for a 12-week treatment as part of a pilot program launching early next year. According to international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, which purchases the generic medicine at the same rate, a comparable course of treatment could cost around $147,000 in the United States.

With the help of CDAF, Brazil announced its “sustainable and financially viable” plan to diagnose and treat all citizens infected with hepatitis C and eliminate the disease by 2030. The Brazilian ministry and Lafayette center are now turning their attention to hepatitis B.

In Colorado, the CDAF declared hepatitis C “a major public health challenge.”

Emerging trends from the center’s research found increasing hepatitis C infections among younger age groups. Colorado’s opioid addiction crisis is a driving factor in new infections. Effective treatments are available, CDAF said, but the screening and treatment rates are unknown “and current public health surveillance systems are imprecise.”

Steinfurth has been working on hepatitis C support and treatment programming in Colorado for more than 10 years. Liver Health Connection hired CDAF to develop a cost-benefit analysis for the state Medicaid department to make a case for allowing more people access to hepatitis C treatment.

Colorado’s previous policy required Medicaid recipients with the virus to have advanced liver damage in order to receive treatment, but the Medicaid department decided in December to begin treating patients earlier.

“It’s just so exciting to be able to see change as a result of working with Homie,” Steinfurth said. “It’s what our community has lacked for decades: real data that shows if you make this change, this is going to benefit this many people and cost this much. Now we’ve got that, and he is the reason. He shares the wealth all over the world.”

Friends and colleagues of Razavi’s have a running joke they call “Where in the world is Homie Razavi” — since the University of Colorado doctoral graduate spends about 80 percent of his time traveling across the world to meet with health professionals.

“I know most airports really well,” Razavi said. “The only way to justify all the travel is the outcome. You go home, and it’s worth it.”

Razavi is pleased with his Boulder County home base, noting that it works because of its proximity to Denver International Airport and ideal quality of life.

“A bonus is it’s 5 minutes away from Sweet Cow Ice Cream,” Dunn said.

While the seemingly random location sometimes throws people off — “I wouldn’t hire us if I lived abroad and saw where we’re from,” Ravazi joked — the center’s work ends up leaving a lasting impression.

“I know they’re from a small city in Colorado, but I don’t really believe that’s important,” Mendes-Correa said. “It’s not important where you come from, but the mind you have in your head and how you use it.”",04/05/2018
The Denver Post,Flies in operating rooms. A bone fragment on a surgical tool. Colorado hospitals under scrutiny for lapses,"Flies buzzed around the fluorescent lights of the operating rooms at Sterling Regional Medical Center, prompting the ire of the medical director.

Yet, weeks later, the insect infestation remained a problem, inspectors noted when they visited in November 2015. Staffers had resorted to vacuuming or swatting the bugs, records show.

At Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, technicians failed to follow manufacturer instructions for pre-cleaning vaginal probes, putting patients at risk of infection, inspectors found in May 2016.

And this year, Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver is under fire for failing to promptly notify patients of questionable sanitary practices after the disclosure that a doctor there last April found a bone fragment from a previous surgery stuck to a tool he was about to use.

The issue of whether hospitals are doing enough to prevent infections from spreading is of vital importance from the metro Denver area to the Eastern Plains and Western Slope.

“Hospital-acquired infections are an incredible concern for patient safety and for the community,” said Hollynd Hoskins, a lawyer who sued Swedish Medical Center in Englewood for lapses that allowed an HIV-infected surgical tech to steal a painkiller syringe from an operating room. “This is a known risk. It’s absolutely critical that all the hospitals, as well as the state and federal agencies that have responsibility for oversight monitoring and enforcement, are sure there is surveillance control and protection.”

Statistics raise concerns on how Colorado is faring in preventing such infections.

The Centennial state ranked eighth-highest in the nation for the percentage of reviewed hospitals that face potential fines for hospital-acquired conditions, according to numbers from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. The conditions surveyed included infections in patients with catheters in major veins and their bladders as well as eight other patient problems.

Fifteen of 48 Colorado hospitals faced potential fines based on the CMS data, according to data collected from January 2015 through December 2016. The review did not include certain rural hospitals. Notably, Colorado ranked No. 9 on the same list in 2014, based on data from January 2012 through December 2013.

How seriously a hospital takes the issue can be a matter of life and death for patients. About 1.7 million healthcare-associated infections occur annually in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 99,000 of those patients die each year, the CDC reports, causing an estimated $20 billion in estimated health care costs.

“Each year, about 1 in 25 U.S. hospital patients is diagnosed with at least one infection related to hospital care alone,” the CDC says.

“Hospitals are making a valiant effort, but they are fighting a battle against a very determined and resourceful enemy,” said Phil Danielson, a University of Denver professor who specializes in infectious diseases.

More drug-resistant strains of bacteria have developed in the past 10 years than in all the previous years of antibiotic use, he said. And intensive care units are jammed with people with compromised immune systems who often rely on catheters or IV lines, all of which create an environment for infections to proliferate.

“In some hospitals, they are seeing patients in ICU with infection rates as high as 50 percent,” Danielson said.

Research is underway on self-cleaning metals for surgical instruments as one way to reduce such infections, he said. Silver-plated hospital equipment may not be on the horizon, but “there are some metals that seem to have properties about them that seem to inhibit bacterial growth,” Danielson said.

A team of 15 state officials monitors how hospitals and other health facilities in Colorado are doing on preventing facility-acquired infections. In addition, Colorado is one of 10 state health departments in the country participating in the CDC’s Emerging Infections Program, which allows for extra monitoring and research of hospital-acquired infections.

In Colorado, one issue in particular has raised concerns among public health officials. The state has been an outlier when compared to others on infections of Clostridium difficile, a diarrhea disease that generally occurs in patients exposed to health care and antibiotics. About 14,000 deaths in the nation annually are tied to this specific infection, according to the CDC.

Colorado’s acute-care hospitals have historically performed worse than their peers in other states on the rate of patients infected by Clostridium difficile, according to data from August 2014 through July 2016. Colorado hospitals reported 2,668 of their patients ended up with that infection during that time frame, resulting in more than 3.2 million hospital patient days. Deaths were not included in the tallies.

Hospitals that performed poorly on the rate of patients with Clostridium difficile complications from August 2014 to July 2015 were Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs, St. Anthony Hospital in Denver, St. Anthony Hospital in Westminster, Medical Center of Aurora, St. Luke’s Hospital in Denver, Good Samaritan Hospital in Lafayette, Parker Adventist Hospital and Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, the state reported. From August 2015 to July 2016, Penrose, St. Anthony in Denver, Parker Adventist and St. Luke’s again had a worse rate than the national average. Joining them were St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland and Lutheran Medical Center in Wheat Ridge, the state said.

A new annual report on health care-associated infections is due in July. Preliminary data show that Clostridium difficile complications tied to hospitals are leveling off, said Wendy Bamberg, Colorado’s health care-associated infections program manager.

Of about 50 Colorado hospitals reporting to the CDC in April 2016 through March 2017, the most recent time period for available data, the state scored better than the national infection rate in two other high-risk areas, central-line associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

CMS inspection reports from last year show that inspectors cited seven of 21 hospitals for lapses in infections protocols.

While hospitals still were researching issues identified in The Denver Post’s reporting and research, their officials stressed that they strive to correct problems when they surface.

Officials at Sterling Medical Center said that when the issue with the flies surfaced, they acted to address the problem and find out the cause. Hospital leaders cleared the operating room and sterilized all equipment before surgeries resumed, they said. The hospital also corrected structural issues, improved equipment inspections and educated staff on the importance of immediately reporting and correcting problems, they added.

“When this issue was recognized, it was addressed expeditiously and effectively with ongoing education and inspections put into place to prevent future issues,” said Hoyt Skabelund, chief executive officer at Sterling. “Patients in Sterling and northeast Colorado can be confident in the documented safety and quality of care that we provide.”

Officials with Centura Health, which owns three hospitals that two years in a row had a high rate of Clostridium difficile infections, said they take the condition seriously and diligently monitor such infections. Centura put together a task force to study the high rate of infections, and also is working to reduce the use of antibiotics at St. Anthony in Denver and St. Anthony in Westminster. Those hospitals also initiated additional focused cleaning with bleach and hydrogen to further drive down those infections, according to officials.

Centura’s Porter Adventist hospital resumed surgeries April 12 after officials there warned, through letters, 5,800 patients of a separate infection risk related to its sterilization procedures, and after they addressed additional concerns related to water quality. The Colorado Health Department has announced that a number of patients at Porter suffered surgery-related infections between July 21, 2016, and April 5, although state officials say they don’t know whether the infections are related to the problems in how the hospital cleaned surgical instruments.

“We are cooperating with the state officials and have resumed surgeries now,” said Centura Health spokeswoman Wendy Forbes.

But lawyer Hoskins said the fact that patients weren’t warned until about a year after the bone fragment was found at Porter raises concerns.

“The ball has been dropped on numerous levels,” said Hoskins, who is representing patients who plan to sue the hospital. “It’s really something we should all be concerned about. There needs to be open transparency to the public about what exactly went wrong and when Porter officials knew about this.”

The Denver Post,"Swedish Medical Center says federal, state agencies recommended tests","A veteran doctor at Swedish Medical Center said Thursday that the hospital followed federal and state recommendations when it asked about 2,900 patients to get tested for three dangerous viruses.

“The health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tell us that in cases of drug diversion that involve injectable drugs, that patients are at increased risk for blood-borne infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C,” said Dr. Matthew Fleishman.

Hospital officials and criminal investigators have not said whether the suspect, 28-year-old surgical technologist Rocky Allen, has been tested for those illnesses himself.

A state order suspending Allen’s license last month noted that he tested positive for fentanyl, a potent narcotic pain medicine, and marijuana.

He is being investigated criminally for allegedly stealing a fentanyl syringe from an operating room on Jan. 22.

Patients who had operations at Swedish between Aug. 17, 2015, the day Allen was hired, and Jan. 22 are being called to get free blood tests at LabCorp locations in the Denver area.

Fleishman emphasized that the hospital decision to test large numbers of patients followed a single incident.

“A staff member witnessed a drug diversion,” he said. “Our first and foremost action was to protect the patient,” followed by “immediate suspension and subsequent termination.”

While incidents leading to blood tests for large numbers of patients are rare in Colorado, drug diversions are not. Last year there were 84 hospital occurrences, according to Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment statistics.

As of midday Thursday, a team of hospital nurses had called about 2,000 patients and reached 1,300 of them. More than 200 have been tested already, but they won’t get results back for seven to 10 days.

That means an anxious waiting period for patients like Shannon Kerrick.

She had an injection at Swedish last October to help treat symptoms of a brittle bone disease.

Wednesday, she received a startling phone call from the hospital alerting her to be tested for HIV and two forms of hepatitis.

She worries for her family.

“I have kids,” she said. “I have a grandbaby on the way. I have a husband. It’s not just the 2,900 patients. It’s their families, as well.”

Now, Kerrick dreads the test.

“It just makes me sick to my stomach,” she said. “I don’t expect to go to the hospital to have something fixed that is bothering me and leave with a deadly virus.”

The Denver Post,Judge blocks Ohio law to divert Planned Parenthood money,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — A federal judge blocked an Ohio law aimed at keeping public money from going to Planned Parenthood, saying in a Friday ruling that the group stood to suffer “irreparable injury.”

The state law targets the more than $1.4 million in funding that Planned Parenthood gets through Ohio’s health department. That money, which is mostly from the federal government, supports certain education and prevention programs. The Ohio law would bar such funds from going to entities that perform or promote abortions.

February 19, 2019 In Jefferson County, a look at how rural/urban political divisions have reached the suburbs The restrictions, which had been slated to take effect in May, were signed by Republican Gov. John Kasich during his failed presidential bid.

Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region sued the state, claiming the law violates their constitutional rights by denying them the funds “in retaliation for” providing abortions. The lawsuit names the state’s health director as a defendant.

The state’s attorneys argue Planned Parenthood is trying to override state policy choices, and no entity has a constitutional right to receive public money.

“Planned Parenthood supplies no basis for disturbing Ohio’s legislative judgments about how to spend its public money,” attorneys wrote in a court brief.

Planned Parenthood says Ohio’s law would not force any of its 28 health centers in the state to close, but the legislation would deprive thousands of patients’ access to HIV tests, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and other prevention and education initiatives.

The group’s attorneys say the law is unconstitutional because it requires, as a condition of receiving government funds, that recipients abandon their constitutionally protected rights to free speech and to provide abortion services.

“A long line of precedent confirms that the state may not seek to leverage its control of public funds to coerce funding recipients to relinquish their constitutional rights in this manner,” the organization said in the lawsuit.

Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, women have a constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is able to survive outside the womb, generally around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Planned Parenthood is a national target because of its role as the largest U.S. abortion provider.

Federal law and the laws of most states already prevent public money from paying for abortions except in rare circumstances, but the recent defunding bills prohibit state money for any services by an organization that also provides abortions.

According to Planned Parenthood, politicians in 24 states have either enacted or proposed measures since last July that target the organization with defunding.

In most of the 24 states, the cuts haven’t taken effect. Some measures have been blocked by the courts or put on hold over litigation, and a defunding bill in Virginia was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.",12/08/2016
The Denver Post,NCAA returns events to North Carolina after state rolls back LGBT law,"RALEIGH, N.C. — The NCAA has awarded coveted men’s basketball tournament games and other events to North Carolina, effectively ending a boycott that helped force the state to repeal parts of a law that limited protections for LGBT people.

The governing body announced decisions Tuesday for events through 2022, two weeks after the NCAA said it had “reluctantly” agreed to consider North Carolina again for hosting duties. It had stripped North Carolina of seven championship events for the past sports season — including opening-weekend men’s basketball tournament games — and said it could relocate more events if there wasn’t a change in the “bathroom bill.”

The list of events included men’s basketball tournament opening-weekend games in Greensboro in 2020 and Raleigh in 2021, as well as a women’s basketball tournament regional in Greensboro in 2019. In addition, the College Cup Division I championship rounds for men’s soccer and women’s soccer will alternate years in Cary from 2018-21, and the Division I women’s field hockey championship will be held in Winston-Salem in 2019.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed a compromise bill March 30 while saying it wasn’t a perfect solution. The compromise was reached days after the NCAA said the state was down to its final days to get something done about the law.

“I think it’s important for our economy, and it’s important for our national reputation,” Cooper said Tuesday before the NCAA announcement. “The NCAA also believes North Carolina has more work to do and we look forward to working with them. I think for sure they’ll bring some of their championships here. I think they value North Carolina and want to be here and we’ll look forward to what they say.”

LGBT rights groups have said the compromise bill doesn’t go far enough, and criticized the NCAA’s decision to return to North Carolina.

“North Carolina’s new law does nothing to guarantee that LGBT people will be protected from discrimination,” said James Esseks, director of the ACLU’s LGBT and HIV Project. “When the NCAA originally withdrew events from North Carolina, they did so because they claimed to care about ‘fairness and inclusion’ for college athletes and fans. It’s a shame to see that those concerns have already fallen by the wayside.”

NCAA President Mark Emmert said at the Final Four that he was pleased the state had passed a new law despite “very difficult” politics. But the NCAA ultimately offered a lukewarm endorsement of the compromise measure days later, saying the new law met “minimal” requirements to allow NCAA back into consideration for future events.

It stated events already awarded to North Carolina for the 2017-18 sports season — including men’s basketball tournament games in Charlotte — would remain in place.

The NCAA’s North Carolina ban for the 2016-17 season didn’t affect teams that earn home-court advantage during the season, such as the Duke women’s basketball team hosting tournament games in March.

The Atlantic Coast Conference also pulled 10 neutral-site events from the state last fall, including moving the football championship game from Charlotte to Orlando, Florida. The conference said after the compromise was reached its upcoming events would remain in place and the football title game would return to Charlotte for its contractual run there through 2019.

The NBA relocated this year’s All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans due to the law as well, though the league hasn’t committed to bringing its annual showcase back.

The loss of men’s basketball tournament games was particularly jarring in basketball-crazy North Carolina, the site of more tournament games (251) than any other state.

North Carolina — which hosted the 1994 Final Four in Charlotte — had hosted games in 11 of 13 years before the NCAA stripped March games from Greensboro. Those games were relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, which had been banned from hosting events for years before that was lifted following the removal of a Confederate flag from state capitol grounds in 2015.

South Carolina was also included on the list for men’s basketball sites, with Columbia hosting opening-weekend games in 2019 and Greenville hosting in 2022.

Cooper had said it was clear that the NCAA had wanted a complete repeal of House Bill 2, as did he. But the governor has said the new law was the best compromise he could get given the Republicans’ veto-proof majorities in the legislature, though it drew criticism from some LGBT rights groups that said it wasn’t good enough.

The replacement bill eliminated a requirement that transgender people use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates in many public buildings. The new law says only state legislators — not local governments or school officials — can make rules for public restrooms.

The original bill also invalidated any local ordinances protecting gay or transgender people from discrimination in the workplace or in public accommodations. The compromise prohibits local governments from enacting any new such protections until December 2020.

The Denver Post,"Federal gun-violence research all but halted 2 decades ago. And if Colorado Republicans in Congress are a sign, that’s not going to change.","WASHINGTON — For more than two decades, Congress has all but barred the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching gun violence — a restriction that liberal lawmakers and gun-control advocates again are trying to lift after last month’s shooting in Florida.

But the latest effort has an uphill climb at best, if Colorado’s congressional delegation is any indication. While the idea enjoys support from the state’s Democrats, none of Colorado’s five Republican lawmakers said they backed the idea and only one — U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, R-Windsor — directly answered questions from The Denver Post about the proposition.

“I have no problem with the CDC doing a study on mental health, but I do have a problem with them singling out one constitutional right,” Buck said in an interview.

It’s a stance that tracks with most GOP lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress, but opponents of the restriction said the limits on research make it more difficult to understand why Americans are several times more likely than citizens of other developed countries to be killed by guns.

“I am urging Congress to address gun violence in the same way that we do any other public health threat: with the active support of rigorous scientific research,” said Dr. Paul Chung, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics who spoke recently with gun-control activists from Giffords, a group founded by shooting survivor and former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

The clamp on the CDC dates to 1996, when then-U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., successfully added language to a spending bill that prohibited the agency from using money to “advocate or promote gun control.”

While it didn’t specifically ban research, it was enough of a roadblock that the CDC has done little on the topic since spending about $2.6 billion on firearms research the year before the Dickey Amendment went into effect.

Congress has kept the measure in place the last two decades, even after Dickey himself argued it should be lifted.

“The same evidence-based approach that is saving millions of lives from motor-vehicle crashes, as well as from smoking, cancer and HIV/AIDS, can help reduce the toll of deaths and injuries from gun violence,” wrote Dickey in an essay that ran in The Washington Post a week after 2012 Aurora theater shooting.

Florida shooting refocused attention on 1996 measure

There’s been a renewed push to remove the restriction since 17 people were shot to death Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., was one of several lawmakers who attended a Wednesday meeting at the White House to discuss gun safety and, after it was done, she said she raised the issue of lifting the gun research restriction with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who told her they would look into the issue.

“I’m hopeful that that means that we may be able to (get) their support on this,” Murphy said. Whether Congress goes along is another matter.

While Trump seemed open last week to the idea of new gun laws, including tougher background checks, Republican leaders in the House and Senate have advocated a narrower response to the Florida killings.

Buck, of Colorado, said some of the latest proposals — such as arming educators or raising the age limit for rifle purchases — should be left in the hands of state and local officials.

“ ‘One size fits all’ is really scary,” Buck said.

As for the CDC restriction, he said he had concerns about its potential effect on the agency’s reputation.

“I think it really politicizes an organization that does a really good job of staying out of a political sphere,” said Buck, who suggested those studies would be a better fit for the FBI or the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

In contrast to the state’s Republicans, every Colorado Democrat in Congress said they wanted to eliminate the Dickey Amendment.

U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver, has been a longtime advocate for the idea, and she signed onto a letter last month that called on congressional leaders to hold hearings on the topic.

The restriction is the “most extreme position against gun safety because it somehow infers that if the CDC did research on the effect of guns on health, that maybe that would lead to some factual discovery that would lead to some kind of gun safety legislation,” DeGette said.

Colorado, other states pick up gun research slack

The dearth of federal research into gun violence has prompted a few states to take steps to do the work themselves.

The University of California at Davis is moving forward with a new Firearm Violence Prevention Research Center with $5 million in state money — an idea that New Jersey is looking to duplicate, according to a new report by Stateline, which is part of the Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment does not “use any funding to do gun research per se,” according to Mark Salley, an agency spokesman.

But it “does use some of its funding to do public health surveillance related to gun injuries and deaths.”

That includes state-funded research into incidents in which a gun caused the death of a Colorado child, as well as input into a CDC-backed project that examines violent deaths, which includes firearm fatalities.

Gun-control advocates have applauded these state-level efforts, but they said that doesn’t diminish the need for federal government research.

“States are starting to now fill in the gap but … the federal government helps drive the research agenda in this country and has the resources to really make a lot of change,” said Mike McLively of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.",04/03/2018
The Denver Post,How a federal court ruling could be a ‘big moment’ for LGBTQ rights,"By Amber Phillips, The Washington Post

As of Tuesday evening, if someone is fired in the United States for being gay (which there are no laws against in more than half the states), they can now file a discrimination lawsuit and reasonably expect it to succeed.

That’s because a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled Tuesday that the 1964 Civil Rights Act means workers can’t be fired based on their sexual orientation. It’s not the first court to decide this, but it is the highest.

LGBT advocates expect that sooner or later, the question of whether U.S. civil rights law applies to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people will reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has the power to overturn a patchwork of nondiscrimination laws (or lack thereof) in 50 states, just like it did when it legalized same-sex marriage across the nation in 2015.

To get a better sense of the changing legal landscape on LGBT rights, we called up James Esseks, director of the ACLU’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project and an advocate for LGBT protections.

Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Q: Does this decision mean LGBT people can get married on a Saturday and no longer fired on a Monday – a disparity in federal law that LGBT advocates often highlight?

A: Yes. In our view, it’s long been true that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are protected under the federal civil rights law. Discrimination against LGBT people is, by its very definition, sex discrimination. What’s happening now in the courts is an emerging recognition that that’s right.

Q: Help me break down a key argument from Tuesday’s ruling, which decided Kimberly Hively was improperly passed over for a teaching job in Indiana because she’s a lesbian. Chief Judge Diane Wood wrote:”Hively represents the ultimate case of failure to conform to the female stereotype . . . she is not heterosexual. Hively’s claim is no different from the claims brought by women who were rejected for jobs in traditionally male workplaces, such as fire departments, construction, and policing.”

A: She’s saying: When an employer decides that it doesn’t want a lesbian on its workforce, it is taking her sex into account, because you can’t understand what a lesbian is unless you understand that it’s a woman who forms intimate relationships with a woman. If she were a man who formed intimate relationships with a woman, this employer wouldn’t have any problem with her. And so the only difference is the sex of the employee. That, says the 7th Circuit Court – we think correctly – is sex discrimination. That’s what the civil rights laws were designed to eradicate.

Q: But the 7th Circuit decision is not the law of the land?

A: The 7th Circuit creates laws for three states: Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. If you say, “Hey, my employer discriminated against me because I’m a lesbian,” in Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin there’s no question that’s [illegal in those states]. The only question in the court will be: “Did they fire you because you’re a lesbian, or did they fire you for some other reason?”

But this decision has persuasive authority elsewhere. More people who have suffered employment discrimination in other parts of the country can use this decision as precedent: “If I can prove they did it because I’m gay, that’s sex discrimination, and it violates federal law. And yes, I have to prove it’s discrimination, but I don’t have to fight about whether I’m covered under the law.”

But other federal courts have ruled that sex discrimination laws don’t apply to LGBT people.

We’re not at the end of the development of this law. But this is a big moment. The 11th Circuit, which sits in Atlanta, just had a panel decision by three judges that went against. But I believe there is going to be a request that the full court there take up this question, just like the 7th Circuit did. There’s a similar situation in New York.

We’re in a moment where a series of very important, influential courts either have taken a look at this question or are poised to. I think we’re at the beginning of a sea change on this issue in the federal courts.",05/04/2017

Special to The Denver Post

A fiesta simply wouldn’t be a fiesta without an abundant supply of music, food and pretty things to buy — and a huge crowd to enjoy it all.

Yolanda Ortega, the owner of Encantada Catering, and attorney Michael Sawaya saw to it that every ingredient was in place when they chaired Fiesta on the Plaza, a grand affair that helps fund the medical services that Clinica Tepeyac will deliver to 16,000 low-income or uninsured patients this year alone.

They were aided by a committee whose 14 members included state Sen. Irele Aguilar, Elaine and Max Appel, Jesse Ogas and Gloria Padilla de Garcia, whose husband, Jim, is the founder and executive director of Clinica Tepeyac. As the 500 guests assembled in the National Western Stadium Arena, they could enjoy cocktails and music by Mariachi Vasquez and La Quinta Nota as they placed silent auction bids and perused a marketplace where vendors offered everything from hand-made jewelry to original works of art.

The call to dinner was a grand “entrada” where 9News weather forecaster Belen DeLeon, the fiesta’s emcee, had Mariachi Vasquez, La Quinta Nota and Grupo Folklorico Sabor Latino give brief performances before she asked the audience to stand as she sang the National Anthem.

Former restaurateur Martine Chavez collaborated with chefs from K-M Concessions to design a dinner menu that included a traditional elote (roasted corn) salad, followed by braised beef short ribs served with sweet potato puree and a Fresno chili sauce. Dessert was citrus flan topped with lime zest whipped cream.

Jim Garcia and board chair Ann Murphy, dean of the Metropolitan State University School of Business, presented the 2016 Corazon y Alma (Heart and Soul) Award to Dr. Bill Burman, an infectious disease specialist currently serving as Denver Health’s interim chief executive officer.

For the past 10 years, Burman has directed Clinica Tepeyac’s HIV program, and while his new position with Denver Health has caused him to cut back on this, he’s also known for riding his bicycle to see patients.

Delta Dental of Colorado was given the Outstanding Community Partner Award for its role in bringing oral health services to the clinic located in Denver’s Globeville-Swansea-Elyria neighborhood. Delta Dental’s CEO, Kate Paul, co-chair of Clinica Tepeyac’s Leadership Council, accepted the award.

Jose and Magdalena Aguayo, who helped start the Museo de las Americas, were among the guests. Others joining in the fun were Cindy Pe~na; Shepard Nevel, who in December will become president/CEO of Jewish Family Service of Colorado, and his wife, Anna Alejo; former DURA director Susan Powers; DIA’s “restaurant king,” Rod Tafoya; Veronica Montoya with her mom, Bea; KBNO Radio owner Zee Ferrufino; and Brenda Vasquez, manager of volunteer services for the Denver Public Schools, and her husband, Gilbert, the high bidders on a trip to Hawaii that was one of the fiesta’s live auction items.

The Denver Post,"Apple cuts prices on lower-end iPads, releases red iPhones","NEW YORK — Apple is cutting prices on two iPad models and introducing red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets.

A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn’t materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases.

The iPad updates come as the tablet market continues to decline, after a few years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent to 53 million worldwide in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015.

The New Lineup

The iPad Air 2 is replaced by a new model simply called the iPad. It retains a 9.7-inch screen, but gains a little weight and thickness. The display is brighter and the processor faster. Its price starts at $329 for 32 gigabytes of storage, down from $399. The standard-size iPad is now cheaper than the smaller Mini model.

The 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at $399, rather than $499 before. Apple is eliminating the 32-gigabyte model, which used to sell for $399. Nothing else is changing.

Apple is also releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. And Apple is doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the $399 starting price.

The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders beginning Friday.

The Missing Device

IDC analyst Jorge Vela had high hopes for a 10.5-inch iPad. He said such a size might have offered room for a better keyboard, compared with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it wouldn’t have been as bulky as the 12.9-inch version.

And Apple typically sparks consumer interest when it has new sizes and designs, Vela said, as seen by a jump in sales following the introduction of larger iPhones in 2014 (iPhone sales have since dropped.) Vela said a 10.5-inch version might have been enough for existing iPad owners to upgrade.

A 10.5-inch version may still come this year, closer to the holiday shopping season, along with updates to existing Pro sizes.

Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said Tuesday’s announcement makes it “even clearer that there are two very distinct iPad tiers now — the iPad Pro and the basic iPads. The iPad Pros will likely continue to get all the best new features, while the basic iPad will get occasional updates and new features a little later than the Pros, lagging a generation or two behind.”

The processor in the new standard-size iPad, for instance, is akin to what’s in the iPhone 6S from 2015. The Mini’s processor is even older.

Down but not out

In the last three months of 2016, iPhones generated 10 times the revenue as iPads. Unit sales of iPads fell 19 percent from the previous year. Yet Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed optimism because many people were buying iPads for the first time, indicating that the market had yet to reach saturation, the point at which everyone who wants a particular product already has one.

Dawson agrees that the number of tablet owners is still growing, even if overall sales are declining because people aren’t upgrading often. He said the new $329 price for the 9.7-inch iPad should help spur sales. New 9.7-inch models have previously cost at least $499.

Far from holding a clearance sale, Vela said Apple is merely taking advantage of lower prices for older components. And Apple might be able to preserve higher profit margins by pushing people into a model with four times the storage, or 128 gigabytes; the extra storage costs Apple far less than the extra $100 that model sells for, Vela said.

Challengers

Apple remains the market leader, accounting for about a quarter of all tablets shipped in the fourth quarter, according to IDC.

Samsung beat Apple to a tablet announcement by nearly a month, though Samsung’s Android-based Galaxy Tab S3 doesn’t actually start selling until this Friday, for $600.

Vela doesn’t consider it a serious threat to Apple. Even though the Tab S3 is more in line with iPad Pros in quality, Vela said people tend to buy Samsung tablets as media-consumption devices, something they can do with the cheaper iPads.

Samsung also has two Windows 10 tablets coming. Called the Galaxy Book, the Windows devices are more likely to challenge Microsoft’s Surface than iPads. Microsoft is due for a refresh of its Surface Pro tablet, last updated in October 2015.

The Denver Post,Ninety percent of Colorado residents with hepatitis C going untreated,"Nearly 90 percent of Colorado residents infected with hepatitis C, now the deadliest infectious disease in the United States, are going untreated, a new report estimates.

The Colorado study, released Wednesday, suggested two reasons:

• Many are baby boomers who contracted the blood disease decades ago through transfusions and don’t know they have it.

• Others have not sought treatment because the new drugs that can cure it are extraordinarily expensive. The drug Sovaldi, for one, can cost $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment — and insurers say they can’t afford to cover such high-cost drugs for everyone who needs them.

Officials estimate at least 70,000 Coloradans have hepatitis C.

The Center for Improving Value in Health Care analyzed data from the Colorado All Payer Claims Database for commercially insured patients to estimate the untreated percentage of hepatitis C carriers.

“When we looked at claims information for insured Coloradans, we were surprised to learn how many patients are not getting treatment for this serious, potentially life-threatening infection,” said Ana English, the center’s president.

Because the disease is curable now, she said, “it’s incumbent upon us as a state to increase access to affordable treatment.”

The Colorado study follows a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report this month that hepatitis C now kills more people than any other infectious disease, including HIV/AIDS.

Left untreated, those infected can develop liver cancer and other life-threatening diseases related to hepatitis C and may unknowingly transmit the disease to others.

According to the CDC, deaths associated with hepatitis C reached an all-time high of 19,659 in 2014. A second agency study showed that by 2013, hepatitis C-related deaths “surpassed the total combined number of deaths from 60 other infectious diseases reported to CDC, including HIV, pneumococcal disease and tuberculosis.”

More people are dying despite new drugs that can cure the disease with fewer side effects.

“Why are so many people dying of this preventable, curable disease?” asked Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of a CDC infectious disease program. “Once hepatitis C testing and treatment are as routine as they are for high cholesterol and colon cancer, we will see people living the long, healthy lives they deserve.”

The CDC estimates that about 3.5 million Americans are living with hepatitis C, and half don’t know it. Similarly, Colorado estimates about 1.3 percent of its residents are infected.

“We think it’s 70,000 people, if not more,” said Daniel Shodell, a deputy director in the epidemiology division.

The new Colorado study found more people are seeking treatment with the new drugs, but estimates that 89 percent are not.

Nationally, a new wave of hepatitis C cases have surfaced since 2010 among young, white people who injected drugs. Those cases more than doubled from 2010 to 2014. But most of those afflicted with hepatitis C are baby boomers — born between 1945 and 1965 — when medical injections and blood transfusions were not as safe as they are today, and before the disease was discovered in 1989.

For that reason, the CDC recommends everyone born between those years should be tested for hepatitis C.

Robert Simon, a Colorado software engineer, is one of the baby boomers who survived.

He had open heart surgery and blood transfusions when he was 6, and again at age 18. He lived for many years after that without knowing he was infected, although he noticed pains in his side and felt exhausted after exercising.

A routine medical visit changed that. “There’s something up with your liver enzymes,” the doctor told him. A test confirmed hepatitis C in his blood.

At the time, the treatment included interferon, a drug associated with depression and other serious side effects.

“It was hard. It really did a number on me,” Simon said. “I couldn’t work for six months.”

But the treatment worked. He has become an avid swimmer. He no longer feels the symptoms preceding the diagnosis. “It appears to be gone,” he said.

Despite the stigma associated with the disease, and his own trials in treatment, he decided to speak out as a grateful survivor.

He would urge anyone with hepatitis C to seek life-saving help.

Health insurers say prices for the new, more effective treatments need to come down.

“The outcomes of some of these new medications are truly remarkable, but unfortunately they are being priced so high it makes it difficult for health plans to offer coverage for them,” said Charlie Sheffield, executive director of the Colorado Association of Health Plans. “This study highlights the need to find better ways to address the increasing cost of drugs, which is a major contributing factor to health care costs overall.”

The Center for Improving Value in Health Care, which published the study, was created by the state and spun off as an independent nonprofit in 2011. It administers the claims database for the state. The database includes comprehensive health care cost, quality and utilization claims data, which is available to the public.

The Denver Post,Feds take over investigation of fentanyl theft at Swedish Medical Center,"Federal investigators have taken over the criminal inquiry into the theft of fentanyl from Swedish Medical Center, allegedly by a surgical technologist.

Rocky Allen, a 28-year-old operating room employee, was dismissed in January after a fellow worker reported seeing him take a syringe of fentanyl at the start of a surgery.

That led hospital officials to ask about 2,900 patients last week to get tested for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

The Englewood Police Department also began a criminal investigation of the alleged theft.

Late Thursday, the Englewood department said Allen has become the subject of a federal investigation.

“We got some information that was turned over to the Food and Drug Administration. Our investigation is closed,” said David Jessen, a master patrol officer speaking for the department.

He did not specify what the department found and referred other questions to Swedish, which offered no immediate comment.

Allen worked in operating rooms at the hospital from Aug. 17 to Jan. 22. The hospital offered free blood tests to anyone who had surgery there at that time.

The hospital emphasized it had no evidence Allen contaminated patients during surgery.

According to the state Division of Professions and Occupations, Allen’s registration as a surgical technologist was suspended Jan. 29.

The suspension order noted that Allen “submitted to a urinalysis which was positive for fentanyl and marijuana.”

The Denver Post,A literary hoax explained — sort of — in “JT LeRoy Story”,"

By Stephanie Merry, The Washington Post

JT LeRoy became a literary sensation overnight in the early 2000s. His rapturously received writing drew from his well-publicized backstory: Jeremiah “Terminator” LeRoy was the HIV-positive teenage son of a truck stop prostitute, but he emerged from the unthinkable — sexual abuse, addiction and homelessness — to write stunning prose.

The only problem: None of it was true. LeRoy was the invention of Laura Albert, a San Francisco woman, who was outed in 2005 by a New York Magazine article.

With the documentary “Author: The JT LeRoy Story,” we’re finally getting to the bottom of what happened. Sort of. Actually, we get Albert’s side of the story, and that’s clearly problematic. How much faith should we put in the account of someone who tells such massive whoppers?

That question constantly hovers over Jeff Feuerzeig’s documentary, which is by turns fascinating and unseemly. Albert, now 50, unapologetically explains how she created JT as an avatar to expel some of her darker emotions. But we also hear from the celebrities who fawned over him: people like Smashing Pumpkins singer Billy Corgan, Courtney Love, Gus Van Sant and actress Asia Argento, whose recorded phone conversations with JT feature prominently in the film. Argento, among others, has said she had no idea she was being recorded.

As Albert tells it, she invented “Terminator” when she was a suicidal 20-something and started calling teen crisis lines. She could never speak for herself, she explains, so she affected a Southern accent and let her troubled teen alter ego do the talking. It was a therapist from one of those calls who suggested she write down her feelings.

After a few cold calls to writers, such as Dennis Cooper and Bruce Benderson, JT landed a book contract, and suddenly Albert had to find someone to pose as her invented author for interviews and book readings. Enter Savannah Knoop, the sister of Albert’s longtime boyfriend. With a wig and glasses, Savannah looked just androgynous enough to be JT. Then Albert posed as Speedie, JT’s British hanger-on. Pretty soon the pair were chatting with Bono backstage at a U2 concert, posing for photos at Cannes and getting kissed by Winona Ryder on a red carpet.

The movie has some nice flourishes, including animated drawings that add visual interest to the narration. But much of the movie is just Albert, looking like an aging punk in a crumpled hat and black leather gloves, explaining how a lifetime of feeling like an overweight misfit led her here. By the time she gets to her big reveal — the awful abuse that is meant to explain away her web of deceit — it’s hard to know what to feel. No one wants to blame the victim. Then again, who wants to be duped again by this woman?

She already has taken advantage of so many people. “Your stories are so alive,” we hear Tom Waits tell JT during a phone call he may or may not have known was being recorded. Does the fact that Albert wrote them instead of JT make his words any less true?

Maybe not, but that won’t alleviate the icky feeling that comes with learning more about Albert’s deeds. If the movie seeks to get us any closer to the truth, its success is debatable. We certainly get closer to Albert’s truth, but do we really want her to have the final word?

Two and one-half stars.

The Denver Post,"“Day Without Immigrants” protest leaves Denver restaurants, construction firms short staffed — but for a well-supported cause","As Lorena Cantarovici sat in her empty restaurant Thursday during the normally busy lunch hour, a chorus of phone calls going unanswered, she said she was at peace with the thousands of dollars she was losing by keeping Maria Empanada closed.

Cantarovici was one of hundreds of business owners across the country who joined in “A Day Without Immigrants” protest of U.S. immigration policy. As an immigrant who came from Argentina in pursuit of the American dream and eventually opened her Denver restaurant, she said the choice was clear.

“But if I need to put my bank account on one side and who I am on the other side, I prefer to pick who I am,” she said.

The day of protest, which wasn’t limited to people living in the country illegally, had impacts across Colorado on Thursday, from restaurants — arguably the hardest hit — to the construction industry and schools.

Denver Public Schools estimated that attendance districtwide was down 4 to 5 percent. At some schools, however, only about 30 to 50 percent of students showed up. Kids absent without their parents’ permission were marked unexcused. Teachers who stayed home were charged a personal day.

Maria Empanada’s neighbors on South Broadway Adelitas Cocina y Cantina and Palenque Mezcaleria shut their doors in solidarity, as did Biju’s Little Curry Shop, Osteria Marco and Russell’s Smokehouse in other parts of the city

Those who missed work could be docked pay, but the Colorado Restaurant Association advised its members not to discipline those employees who missed work beyond that.

“The Colorado Restaurant Association has long supported responsible immigration reform because foreign-born workers are critical to our industry,” the trade group’s spokeswoman Carolyn Livingston said.

At the popular El Taco De Mexico restaurant on Santa Fe Drive, a sign on the door asked patrons to be patient because of a limited workforce. Inside, only two people were working the typically bustling taco spot, and several customers walked away because the business was only accepting cash.

“I think everyone has a First Amendment right to protest,” said Adam Killian as he arrived at Adelitas Cocina y Cantina to find it closed. “This is just going along with that. ”

Killian said he was in support of the demonstration — even if it cost him the tasty lunch he was seeking. He works in construction and said his crew was short about 20 percent of its workers Thursday.

“I totally support it,” Mingwei Song, who came to Denver from China for her studies, said as she read a sign on Maria Empanada’s door explaining why the restaurant was closed. “This country is run by immigrants. Everybody was an immigrant at some point.”

Cantarovici said 99 percent of the people who she turned away on Thursday were supportive of the protest. Someone even left flowers at her restaurant’s door.

A few others were more frustrated. “If these people were here legally, then this restaurant wouldn’t be closed,” said John, who declined to give his last name, as he stood outside Adelitas Cocina y Cantina.

“People who have been with me 10, 13 years, without missing a day are choosing to make their voices heard on this one,” chef and restaurateur Frank Bonanno said in a statement on Facebook. “I stand with them. We stand with our team. In honor of today’s protests, Osteria Marco & Russell’s Smokehouse will be closed.”

Some members of the Breckenridge Restaurant Association were waiting to see if workers showed up on Thursday to see if they would operate, the Summit Daily reported.

Servicios de La Raza, which provides help to HIV and AIDS patients and mental health counseling, kept its doors closed. In a Facebook post, the social services organization said the move was “in support of our immigrant and refugee communities, our brothers and sisters, our children, our elders, our people in struggle for justice and peace against racism and hate.”

The Laborers’ International Union in Denver was encouraging its members to go to work, a union representative who wouldn’t give her name because the union isn’t involved with the job action said Thursday.

But contractors who employ the union’s 1,700 members haven’t reported any absences, she said. “We haven’t gotten any complaints.”

Maria Corral, of Service Employees International Union Local 105, said she didn’t know how many of the local’s 7,000 health care and property service workers, didn’t go to work on Thursday.

Local president Ron Ruggiero said in a written statement that taking off a day to protest is risky for immigrants. “However, for some people the struggles they experience as immigrants outweigh those risks of missing work today. The political rhetoric often ignores the fact that immigrant workers contribute more to our economy than they receive and often face the toughest working conditions.”",16/02/2017
The Denver Post,Expensive specialty drugs are forcing seniors to make hard choices,"For 23 years, Diane Whitcraft injected herself every other day with Betaseron, a drug that helps prevent flare-ups from multiple sclerosis. The drug worked well, drastically reducing Whitcraft’s trips to the hospital. But as her 65th birthday approached last September, she made a scary decision: to halt the medication altogether.

With health insurance through her job, Whitcraft had paid a $50 or $100 monthly co-pay for the drug; she hadn’t even realized that the price of Betaseron had soared to more than $86,000 a year. Shopping around for drug coverage through Medicare, the out-of-pocket costs were mind-boggling: close to $7,000 annually.

“I was just feeling really bad that my disease was going to affect our retirement budget,” Whitcraft said. “You’re retired; you’re on a fixed income. And it just really was bothersome to me. I was doing this to us. This disease was doing this to us.”

Whitcraft’s dilemma highlights a growing problem with Medicare prescription drug coverage for seniors who take high-priced specialty drugs: There is no cap on how much they pay. Each prescription drug plan is structured a little differently, but people with very high drug costs almost inevitably enter what’s called the “catastrophic” phase of coverage. Then, they pay 5 percent of the list price of their drug – no small sum in an age of $10,000-a-month cancer drugs or, in Whitcraft’s case, a more than $7,000-a-month multiple sclerosis therapy.

The number of seniors who reach the catastrophic phase has almost doubled over a four-year period, to more than 1 million people in 2015, according to a new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That trend was driven in part by a new generation of high-priced hepatitis C drugs, but includes high out-of-pocket costs for people taking drugs for cancer, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and HIV.

The Affordable Care Act took steps to close the “doughnut hole,” the coverage gap where seniors have been on the hook for more of their prescription drug costs. But for a growing number, the doughnut hole barely matters. Their first or second prescription fill of the year might get them out of it, plunging them into a bigger problem – a phase of coverage where there’s no upper limit on how much they will pay.

“Once people blow through the doughnut hole and reach the catastrophic threshold, they continue to pay. And these costs are ticking up,” said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “While 5 percent coinsurance doesn’t sound like a lot, it can really add up for people who are taking extremely expensive medicines.”

The Kaiser study found that in 2015, the 1 million seniors who reached the catastrophic threshold paid an average of more than $3,000 out of pocket. One in 10 of them paid at least $5,200.

Neuman noted that the data, showing a huge increase in the number of people reaching the catastrophic threshold, wouldn’t even take into account people such as Whitcraft, who simply opt out and don’t fill prescriptions because of the cost. One possible policy solution would be to add a cap for out-of-pocket drug costs beyond a certain threshold – an idea that has been proposed in legislation.

Stacie Dusetzina, a cancer health services researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that the trend probably is driven by a combination of factors: more high-priced specialty drugs coming on to the market, price increases over time for existing drugs and more people taking expensive drugs.

The trend also challenges the pharmaceutical industry’s main argument in defending list prices – that those prices are misleading because they do not represent the secret rebates provided to insurers or reflect what patients pay. Seniors are paying coinsurance prices paid based on the list prices, not the secretly negotiated rebated price.

“This is why list prices matter, and rebates aren’t directly helping people needing specialty drugs,” Dusetzina said.

Whitcraft took her last dose of Betaseron on Jan. 5. So far, she hasn’t had another attack, but she knows the threat is always there. She said she wouldn’t have made the same decision to stop the drug if she were younger, and she wrestled with what to do.

This summer, she did something she thinks she should have done a long time ago. She wrote a letter to the chief executive of Bayer, the company that makes the drug.

Bayer spokeswoman Sasha Damouni said that the company goes through a series of steps before making a decision on how to price a drug, including discussions with doctors and patients. The company also assesses the product’s ability to reduce health-care costs by avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations.

But Whitcraft still doesn’t understand why her drug, which launched with a list price of about $11,500 more than two decades ago, costs so much today – a question she raised in her letter.

“It wasn’t filled with anger or anything; I just told him that I had quit the drug, and why. And I suggested someone must be very greedy,” she said. “It’s so wrong and so unfair – a drug that was marketed for the first time in 1993 . . . Why did the cost go up so much here?”

The Denver Post,Albinos are being killed in record numbers in Malawi,"Over the past year and a half, a disturbing and violent trend has been growing in Malawi, a country often known by its nickname: “The Warm Heart of Africa.” At least 18 people with albinism, a congenital condition resulting in a lack of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, have been murdered, and many others have been raped or harassed. Four of the murders happened in April alone, and five more albinos have been abducted and are still missing.

A new report from Amnesty International accuses Malawian police of failing to protect the albino population, and the Malawian government of failing to educate its citizens about albinism’s natural causes.

Albinism is more common in sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere in the world. Superstitions about the condition are rife, especially in Malawi and neighboring Tanzania and Mozambique. Some believe that having sex with an albino woman can cure HIV, which puts albino women at particular risk for rape. Others believe that the bones of albino people contain gold, or have medicinal or even magical properties. That demand, stemming from a ritual medicine revival in Malawi, is fueling the spate of murders by gangs that, allegedly, can make as much as $75,000 selling a “full set” of albino body parts, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Separately from Amnesty, the United Nations recorded at least 65 cases of violence against albinos, including but not limited to killings and dismemberment, since the end of 2014.

Ikponwosa Ero, an independent expert who works with the United Nations on issues around albinism, told Al Jazeera that she thinks albinos in parts of southern Africa face extinction. “I said that this will happen over time if nothing is done,” she said. “The situation is a potent mix of poverty, witchcraft beliefs and market forces which push people to do things for profit.”

In a vacuum of public knowledge about the causes of albinism, many albinos are shunned by their families, and parents are often baffled by giving birth to albino children. The abductions and killings, some of which have been particularly gruesome, have instilled a culture of fear in the albino population. While Amnesty says that the police have done little to combat the rise of so-called “albino hunters,” the police say they are doing everything they can. Last year, Malawi’s inspector general of police authorized his officers to shoot any suspected “albino hunter” on sight.",07/06/2016
The Denver Post,Bill Clinton defends work of Clinton Foundation,"By Ken Thomas, Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Former President Bill Clinton defended the work of his charitable foundation Monday, telling supporters that it had “improved millions of lives around the world” but needs to change if his wife, Hillary Clinton, wins the White House.

The former president outlined the Clinton Foundation’s accomplishments and planned shift in scope in an email to about 500,000 supporters. It came hours after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called the foundation “the most corrupt enterprise in political history” adding, “It must be shut down immediately.”

Bill Clinton announced last week that the foundation will no longer accept contributions from foreign governments and corporations if his wife, the Democratic presidential nominee, is elected. The ex-president, who oversees the foundation with daughter Chelsea Clinton, also said he would hold his final Clinton Global Initiative meeting next month in New York regardless of the election’s outcome.

“Since Hillary began her presidential campaign in 2015, Chelsea and I have made it clear that the work the Clinton Foundation started should continue if Hillary is elected, but that changes would be necessary,” Bill Clinton said in the email. “While it would be presumptive to assume a victory in November, now that Hillary is her party’s nominee, it would be irresponsible not to plan for it.”

The changes aim to address criticism from Republicans and some Democrats that the foundation has created a significant conflict of interest as Hillary Clinton seeks the presidency. While Trump has donated to the foundation previously, he has charged Hillary Clinton with creating a “pay-for-play” scheme at the State Department through the work of the foundation.

Defending the foundation’s mission, Bill Clinton pointed to more than 11.5 million people in more than 70 countries who have gained access to HIV/AIDS drugs at a much lower cost and millions of American students who have healthier food and more physical education options because of the foundation. He also noted the foundation’s work around the globe, including efforts to help improve Haiti’s sustainability, foster job training in Latin America and support farmers in East Africa.

The ex-president said in the event of another Clinton presidency, the foundation’s work, funding and his role in it would raise questions that would need to be resolved “in a way that keeps the good work going while eliminating legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest.”

If Hillary Clinton is elected, the former president said the foundation would accept contributions only from U.S. citizens, permanent residents and U.S.-based independent foundations, whose names would continue to be disclosed on a quarterly basis. He said the official name would be changed from the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation. And he said he would step down from the board and no longer raise money for it.

Bill Clinton said that much of the foundation’s international activities would be transitioned to other organizations to continue that type of work.

John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, said in a statement on Monday that the foundation had laid out “unprecedented steps” that it would take if Hillary Clinton is elected. He urged Trump to “come clean” with the electorate about the business mogul’s “complex network of for-profit businesses” that are in debt to big banks, the Bank of China and business groups with ties to Russia.",22/08/2016
The Denver Post,Hurricane stresses Puerto Rico’s already weak health system,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Martin Lopez was shot in the hand last Saturday by two thieves who made off with his precious cans of gas in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. He was rushed to Centro Medico, a trauma center in the Puerto Rican capital where in ordinary times he would be quickly treated by surgeons and sent on his way.

But five days later, the 26-year-old cook was still waiting because only a fraction of the operating rooms were available due to an island-wide breakdown in the electrical power grid caused by the storm. He finally got the surgery and the hospital said he was on the mend Friday — but the same can’t be said for Puerto Rico’s badly stressed medical system.

“Thank God I’m fine, I’m getting better,” he told The Associated Press in an air-conditioned medical tent set up by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the grounds of Centro Medico. “But Puerto Rico is destroyed. It’s really sad.”

Of all the problems unleashed by the storm, which roared over the island Sept. 20 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 155 mph, the plight of overtaxed hospitals and smaller clinics — and health care in general — is one of the most worrying for officials grappling with recovery efforts.

The health system in the U.S. territory was already precarious, with a population that is generally sicker, older and poorer than that of the mainland, long waits and a severe shortage of specialists as a result of a decade-long economic recession. The island of 3.4 million people has higher rates of HIV, asthma, diabetes and some types of cancer, as well as tropical diseases such as the mosquito-borne Zika and dengue viruses.

In Maria’s wake, hospitals and their employees are wrestling with the same shortages of basic necessities as everyone else. There are people who are unable to keep insulin or other medicines refrigerated. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the tropical heat as widespread power outages mean no air conditioning. And amid the widespread disruption, it’s often difficult to get kids to a doctor, especially for families who can’t afford to drive long distances on a tank running out of gasoline.

“Whenever there is a disaster that impacts an area to the degree that this one has, then yes, people’s lives are going to be in danger,” said Dr. James Lapkoff, an emergency room doctor in Waynesville, North Carolina, who was part of the HHS team dispatched to Puerto Rico.

Days before the hurricane hit, 56-year-old retired government worker Damaris Torres tried to find a safe place for her son, who has been bedridden for a decade after a traffic accident and depends on a ventilator, oxygen tank and feeding tube.

She has a small generator at home and a battery connected to an inverter as backup, but she didn’t want a rerun of what happened when Hurricane Irma hit just weeks earlier. Back then her son, 30-year-old Manuel Alejandro Olivencia, was transferred to three hospitals in less than 40 hours because his family was told there was no “special place” for someone on a ventilator.

“He’s in such delicate condition,” Torres said, her eyes welling with tears as she recounted how a hospital in the northern fishing town of Catano finally took him in.

That facility relies on a generator, but officials say they constantly worry about running out of fuel.

“Diesel is the one thing everyone is asking for,” Mayor Felix Delgado said as he visited the hospital on a recent morning.

Maria knocked out electricity to the entire island, and only a handful of Puerto Rico’s 63 hospitals had generators operating at full power. Even those started to falter amid a shortage of diesel to fuel them and a complete breakdown in the distribution network.

Patients were sent to Centro Medico and several other major facilities, quickly overwhelming them. The situation is starting to improve, with about half of the hospitals getting direct power or priority shipments of diesel, but that barely addresses the challenges facing the island as a whole.

Jorge Matta, CEO of the nonprofit that runs the complex of hospitals that make up Centro Medico, said progress was being made on restoring power capacity there and finding places to send patients whose homes were destroyed. He said they expected to have all 20 operating rooms at the trauma center back up this weekend. But other parts of the island are in much worse shape.

“Right now we have hospitals (elsewhere) that need diesel, they need water, they need oxygen,” Matta said.

On Saturday, authorities evacuated dozens of patients at one hospital in the capital of San Juan after its backup generator failed. They were taken to other nearby hospitals already struggling with an overflow of patients.

Metro Pavia, which operates several hospital campuses across the island, warned Friday that it was closing emergency rooms in Arecibo and Ponce because it did not have enough diesel.

Meanwhile medicines are running low and obtaining fuel is an ongoing struggle, said Dr. David Lenihan, president of Ponce Health Sciences University, the only medical clinic currently serving southern Puerto Rico.

“If these things start deteriorating, there’s a significant amount of lives at risk,” he said. “We’re providing care, but it’s not optimal care.”

At the Doctors’ Center Hospital in the northern city of Bayamon, Dr. Victor Rivera said they are so overwhelmed that he has been intercepting patients in the ER waiting room and even outside while people are still in their cars, and sending them on their way with medical advice or a prescription in non-emergency cases.

Only one of the hospital’s four surgery rooms is operating because the others were contaminated when they were used as shelters after Maria ripped off the roof on the fifth floor and blew out the windows on the fourth.

Rivera said the hospital, like many others, is relying on overworked generators.

“They’ve been hit with an enormous amount of work,” he said, noting that the hospital had turned them on earlier during Hurricane Irma and increasingly worries they could fail. “This could potentially be a catastrophe for any hospital.”

With capacity maxed out, he has been sending patients who suffer from asthma, diabetes and other conditions to other hospitals nearby.

Hospitals are struggling to treat a wide variety of conditions in Maria’s wake. The first wave was people with cuts and other wounds sustained in the storm. There are also people like Lopez, who was robbed after waiting in line five hours to buy a rationed supply of gas, who have the type of non-storm-related injuries typically treated at Centro Medico.

The hospital serves as the main trauma center for many around the Caribbean, and when Maria hit, it was already treating patients from the island of St. Maarten who were injured in Hurricane Irma.

Centro Medico and a couple others are also receiving patients from all over Puerto Rico from clinics unable to handle them, straining the system.

Gov. Ricardo Rossello has ordered that all major hospitals be placed on a priority list for receiving diesel.

The U.S. Navy has also dispatched the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship that has been deployed during previous disasters such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

The vessel’s sailing plan was a Friday departure from Norfolk, Virginia, with up to five days before it would reach Puerto Rico.",30/09/2017
The Denver Post,Heading to gov’s desk: No debate to speed up Louisiana medical marijuana bill,"BATON ROUGE — An effort to speed up and expand the dispensing of medical marijuana in Louisiana won final legislative passage Monday, spurred by personal stories of people with seizures and severe pain that bill advocates say would be eased with medicinal-grade pot.

Lawmakers created a framework for the Louisiana medical marijuana program last year, but regulatory hurdles built into the law have slowed its start.

The bill by Republican Sen. Fred Mills, a St. Martin Parish pharmacist, will broaden the program to cover more diseases and make regulatory changes aimed at getting marijuana — in an oil form that can t be smoked — into patients hands more quickly.

Senators agreed to House changes made to Mills bill with a 22-14 vote and no debate. The measure heads next to Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has said he will sign it into law.

In sending the bill to the governor s desk, lawmakers spurned opposition from local sheriffs and district attorneys who described the bill as a step toward unfettered, recreational use of marijuana.

Those arguments failed to gain traction against stories from parents who described children struggling with uncontrollable seizures, who talked of moving to Colorado to lessen their children s suffering and who launched billboards and social media campaigns for the bill.

During debates, lawmakers told personal stories of their own family members with cancer, epilepsy and other medical conditions that could be treated with medical marijuana.

The law passed last year will eventually get medicinal-grade pot to people suffering from cancer and a severe form of cerebral palsy. Mills proposal will add seizure disorders, HIV, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and other diseases to the list.

The bill also sets a Sept. 1 deadline for LSU and Southern University to decide if they want to be the state-sanctioned grower of the product, in an effort to speed the decision-making since the schools get first right of refusal to grow the plant.

It also reworks some of the regulatory language to address doctors concerns about running afoul of federal drug regulations, allowing a physician to recommend use of therapeutic marijuana, rather than prescribe the drug.

Mills has estimated Louisiana is about two years away from getting medical marijuana to patients. The state-sanctioned grower needs to be selected, along with 10 licensed distributors.

The Denver Post,Georgia lawmaker scores a way to revive his medical marijuana bill,"ATLANTA — A push to expand the number of people allowed to possess medical marijuana in Georgia got new life Tuesday after a Republican lawmaker s original proposal stalled in the state Senate.

Republican Rep. Allen Peake of Macon gutted an unrelated Senate bill already approved by that chamber and replaced it with his proposal extending immunity for possessing medical cannabis oil to patients with autism, HIV or AIDS, post-traumatic stress disorder and several other conditions.

A House committee approved the new Georgia medical marijuana bill Tuesday afternoon, sending it to the Rules committee, which decides when measures receive a floor vote.

We live to fight another day, Peake said. This gives more citizens who have debilitating illness an option. The question becomes: Why wouldn t we do this?’

The House last month passed Peake s original bill, 152 votes to 8. But it stalled when it reached the Senate. State Sen. Renee Unterman, a Buford Republican who chairs her chamber s Health and Human Services committee, said this week that there wasn t time to hold a hearing on the bill before lawmakers adjourn next week.

Peake s parliamentary move would allow the House to hold a floor vote, sending the bill back to the Senate for agreement and bypass Unterman s committee. But there are no guarantees in the hectic final days of the 40-day legislative session.

Lawmakers last year approved Georgia medical marijuana legislation allowing people with certain medical conditions and a doctor s approval to legally possess cannabis oil after registering with the state. Patients say they still must travel to states where the product can be manufactured.

Peake originally hoped to pass legislation allowing state-licensed manufacturers of medical marijuana to operate in Georgia. But opposition in the House and from Gov. Nathan Deal forced changes.",16/03/2016
The Denver Post,There are an estimated 40 million slaves in the world. Where do they live and what do they do?,"Slavery is not a thing of the past. A report released Tuesday by the U.N.-affiliated International Labor Office (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation estimates that there were 40.3 million people in some form of modern slavery around the world on any given day last year.

But by its very nature, the accuracy of that figure is hard to gauge. Slavery tends to be a hidden, illegal practice – one in which the victim’s ability to speak out is limited. The authors of the Global Estimates of Modern Slavery study admit there are gaps in the available information: Although extensive United Nations data has been used in the study, some countries and sub-national regions are missing.

“It’s difficult or even impossible to do research in areas of high conflict,” said Fiona David, Walk Free Foundation’s executive director of global research, pointing to areas such as Syria or northern Nigeria that had to be excluded from the study. Because of this, David said, the estimate of 40.3 million is probably conservative.

Walk Free hopes that disconcerting detail could prompt global action. “This is truly historic,” said Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining magnate and founder of the anti-slavery nonprofit organization. “We know we’re dealing with a major problem.”

The Global Estimates of Modern Slavery study found that slavery occurs in every region – and probably every country – of the world. In terms of sheer numbers, the majority of modern slaves probably live in Asia and the Pacific region. Meanwhile, slavery as a practice is thought to be most prevalent in Africa. The report cautions, however, that with more accurate data, these rankings could well change.

Notably, the study does not break down its figures country by country, like the separate Global Slavery Index published annually since 2013 by Walk Free. Some experts, such as prominent human trafficking scholar Anne Gallagher, have criticized the methodology of Walk Free’s indexes, while noting that the aim of providing an accurate estimate of modern slavery is a noble one.

The ILO, a U.N. agency that deals with labor standards, has also put out its own figures in the past that tended to be lower than Walk Free’s estimates – further confusing the matter.

Researchers hope to compel world leaders to take the issue more seriously by using a new methodology that incorporates a large amount of new data from sources such as the International Organization for Migration and that combines the work of Walk Free and the ILO. The report is being released to coincide with the U.N. General Assembly, where progress made towards Sustainable Development Goals – a series of agreements made among countries to improve the world by 2030 – will be discussed. (Modern slavery is specifically mentioned in these goals.)

“The message the ILO is sending [ . . .] is very clear: the world won’t be in a position to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals unless we dramatically increase our efforts to fight these scourges,” Guy Ryder, the ILO director general, said in a statement. “These new global estimates can help shape and develop interventions to prevent both forced labor and child labor.”

That may be true. The Global Estimates of Modern Slavery report not only offers details of where enslaved people live, but also some potentially surprising details on how they live. Most modern slaves tend not to be men in chains like our imagination might suggest, the report finds.

In fact, most are not men at all. Women and girls account for an estimated 28.7 million of enslaved people, about 71 percent of the total. Meanwhile, 1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are thought to be younger than 18.

There was also widespread variation in the type of slavery found. An estimated 24.9 million people were victims of forced labor in 2016, the report found. Most of these people (64 percent) were in forced labor exploitation in the private economy, most likely to be domestic workers, construction workers or those in manufacturing. A further 19 percent were in forced sexual exploitation while 17 percent were in state-imposed forced labor.

Separate to this concept of forced labor is another definition of slavery: forced marriage, which makes up 38 percent, or 15.4 million, of the total number. Notably, women and girls make up 88 percent of forced marriages, as well as 99 percent of sexual exploitation.

The report found that people end up in these situations for a variety of reasons. When it comes to forced labor, the most common form of coercion was withheld wages, with debt bondage a widespread tactic. Threats of violence were also common, as were actual acts of physical violence. Women were also disproportionately likely to face sexual violence as a coercion tactic. Forced marriages often involve children who are not able to give consent; sometimes women are forced to marry to cancel a debt or settle a family dispute. The marriage may be part of a tradition, although often forced marriages are used by armed groups during conflict.

There probably is more work needed to make these kind of macro-level estimates more accurate, David acknowledged. The ILO’s campaign against child labor began decades ago, she said, and it is only because of initial estimates made all that time ago that we can see whether policies are having an effect. “We’re really at very early days at equivalent with modern slavery,” David said.

But Forrest said that he hoped now that Walk Free and the ILO have agreed upon a figure, more process could be made to eradicate modern slavery. “Modern slavery absolutely exists,” he said. “And unlike natural phenomena – like cancer or HIV or Ebola – this is something that we as people control.”",20/09/2017
The Denver Post,Why can’t we just get rid of the world’s mosquitoes?,"Dear Science: I seem to be a total mosquito magnet, and nothing I try keeps the biters at bay. With serious illnesses such as Zika to worry about, why don’t we just get rid of the pests once and for all. What good do mosquitoes do?

Mosquitoes are our most deadly adversaries in the animal kingdom. While the “factoid” that floats around about malaria causing “half of all human deaths” throughout history is not true, we do have the insects to thank for some devastating diseases. More than 400,000 people were killed by malaria in 2015. Warming climates and increased global travel have helped previously obscure viruses such as Zika and chikungunya gain footholds across the globe. And even if you never face a life-threatening disease because of a mosquito bite, swelling and itching is hardly a pleasant experience.

So why don’t we just zap them all? Unfortunately, you won’t read about the total eradication of mosquitoes anytime soon.

Only female mosquitoes bite, and only for a very brief portion of their life cycle — when they need nutrients to create eggs.

“They’re trying to do the right thing,” said Ole Vielemeyer, infectious-disease expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. “They’re just trying to have enough food for their offspring.”

But during that stage of life, they might bite multiple victims (including those of different species). If a mosquito bites someone infected with an illness that can replicate inside the insect’s gut instead of simply being digested, that virus or parasite can then sneak into a new host when the bug’s saliva slips into a bite. It’s not the infected blood itself being passed along, which is why you can’t get HIV from a bug bite. Still, plenty of pathogens have evolved to thrive in mosquito saliva.

“Most of mosquitoes are harmless. But when they transmit diseases, horrible things can happen,” Vielemeyer added. “The ones that carry disease have caused human suffering for millennia. So it’s kind of a mixed bag.”

Many mosquitoes serve an important biological purpose. They can help pollinate plants as they feed on nectar (their usual food source, outside of that crucial blood meal period) and provide a vital source of food for larger animals. They’re vital components of a complex ecosystem, just like every other living thing. Researchers in the Arctic worried that climate change would lead more animals to feast upon local mosquitoes, throwing the food web out of whack and leaving plants unpollinated. As it turns out, warmer water has actually produced an Arctic mosquito boom — but that’s not great news for the baby caribou they feed upon.

The point is that just because humans hate mosquitoes doesn’t mean that they can be wiped out without consequences.

“We see the mosquito as sort of this evil thing,” Vielemeyer said. “But there are lots of positive things that they do in the ecosystem.”

That doesn’t mean that scientists have a live-and-let-live philosophy about these insects: Researchers are trying to eradicate mosquitoes. But they’re focusing on the ones that cause the most harm. The aegypti mosquitoes that cause Zika and the like — mosquitoes that have evolved to live in urban areas — are a particularly attractive target.

“There is no visible end to this except a war against aegypti,” Jo Lines of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently told The Guardian. “Otherwise this is going to go on for a thousand years.”

Many scientists are working on creating genetically modified male mosquitoes that can only father sterile offspring. If released into the population, these males could trick deadly mosquitoes into wasting their blood meals on useless eggs.",03/08/2016
The Denver Post,Only the sickest Coloradans on Medicaid get breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C,"It’s not until the final two stages of liver damage that needy Coloradans with the blood-borne hepatitis C virus get access to a life-saving drug with a 90-percent cure rate and an exorbitant price tag.

“You’ve got to be on death’s door before they will treat you,” said David Higginbotham, a Colorado Medicaid beneficiary who contracted the virus 35 years ago while working as a hospital surgical tech. He would take the 12-week medication “in a heartbeat” if the Colorado Medicaid department would cover it, but Higginbotham’s liver “score” is 1 out of 4, and the government insurance plan won’t pay for the medicine until liver scarring has progressed to a score of at least 3.

Now pressure for change is increasing against the state Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which has restricted access to the breakthrough drug due to its cost. State officials say they must balance the public health issue with the taxpayer expense of paying the prescriptions of the more than 9,000 people with hepatitis C on the government insurance system.

Until a few years ago, the best treatment for hepatitis C included toxic injections that went on for a year, had an estimated cure rate of only 50 percent and were tortuous — the side effects including bone pain, memory loss, depression and nausea. A drug called Sovaldi approved in 2013 was a game-changer: 12 weeks of therapy without the excruciating side effects, and its cure rate is 90 percent.

Estimated cost of the 12-week treatment is $30,000 to $40,000, down significantly from the initial $1,000 per pill — a total of $84,000 — when the drug was the only one on the market but still a potential budget buster for Colorado’s Medicaid department.

The department so far has spent $26.6 million on prescription drugs for 326 hepatitis C patients, an average cost of $82,000 per person, since the new antivirals came on the market, according to a June letter to legislators from Dr. Judy Zerzan, the department’s chief medical director. She estimated it would cost an additional $1.14 billion to treat all hepatitis C patients with Medicaid regardless of how far their disease had progressed.

The interim chief executive of Denver Health Medical Center, William Burman, as well as the ACLU of Colorado, recently sent letters to the state Medicaid department asking for change.

Burman wrote that the drug restrictions are leading to more health disparity and death at Denver Health, the largest health care provider for low-income people in Denver. Hepatitis C patients with Medicare or commercial insurance are “universally approved” for the new antiviral, while Medicaid patients are routinely denied, he said. If the state doesn’t change, treatment policies “may be made in a courtroom, rather than in the exam room,” he wrote.

A federal court ruling eliminated similar restrictions in Washington. Several other states, including Florida, Connecticut and New York, have increased access to treatment without court battles.

In its letter, the ACLU argued that Colorado’s restrictions are illegal because they contradict guidelines issued in November by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, warning states against imposing “unreasonable” restrictions of the new drug. The 12-week treatment is recommended for all hepatitis C patients — not just those in the final stages of the disease — by medical associations including the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Colorado’s policy “has the bizarre effect of requiring eligible beneficiaries — who could be treated immediately with few to no adverse side effects — to wait until their disease causes irreparable liver damage before they can access curative treatment,” wrote ACLU legal director Mark Silverstein in the letter also signed by a pro bono attorney from Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and Harvard Law School’s Center for Health Law & Policy Innovation.

But state officials said the federal letter regarding hepatitis C treatment is a guideline, not a mandate.

“The prices of the medications that have been set by the manufactures for hepatitis C have had a very significant and negative impact on this public health issue,” Dr. Zerzan told the legislature’s Joint Budget Committee in December. The high price of the drugs has forced Medicaid into policies that treat “the sickest patients first,” she said.

The majority of people with hepatitis C survive — the disease has a national mortality rate of five in 100,000 people, Zerzan told lawmakers. One study found that in 95 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries with the virus, the disease did not progress during a two-year period, she said.

But physicians said that even though the disease is often slow to progress, prolonging treatment can lead to severe consequences. National statistics show 20 to 30 percent of people with the virus end up with irreversible liver damage, including cirrhosis, and that hepatitis C kills more people than the 60 other infectious diseases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention combined.

Besides limiting treatment to the sickest patients, Colorado excludes people who have used drugs, including marijuana, or consumed alcohol in the previous six months. The state also denies coverage of the drug to hepatitis C patients unless the prescription is written by an infectious disease physician, hepatologist or other specialist — a primary-care doctor is not enough, which the ACLU argues, limits rural Coloradans in particular.

Physicians and others arguing for new Medicaid policy said curing more people with hepatitis C would go far in curbing the virus, typically spread through blood transfusions or drug needles.

“You can’t just sit back and wait because you don’t know which one of your clients is going to go into cirrhosis,” said Nancy Steinfurth, executive director of Liver Health Connection, a national organization based in Denver.

Higginbotham, who was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1997, immediately changed his diet and stopped drinking alcohol. He feels like he is “being punished” for taking care of himself because his liver isn’t scarred enough to qualify for the new antiviral. “If it were up to me, I would eradicate hepatitis C from the state of Colorado,” he said.

The idea isn’t that far-fetched, at least medically. “If you could treat every human, and cure them, then nobody would be transmitting the virus and the epidemic would stop,” said Dr. Sarah Rowan, associate director of HIV and viral hepatitis prevention at Denver Public Health. Denver Public Health and University of Colorado’s HIV clinical program cured 95 percent of patients of hepatitis C in 2014 and 2015 by using the new drugs, according to a recent study.

Waiting to treat patients until they have severe liver damage is dangerous, putting them at higher risk for cancer and death, said Rowan, adding that she has patients nearing liver failure who were denied treatment because they had used marijuana in the last six months. “It’s very difficult to see patients week after week who are seeking treatment … and have it be denied,” she said. “We’d really like to be able to treat everyone and to make a dent in this public health problem.”

The state’s drug utilization review board is scheduled to meet Aug. 16 and will hear testimony from people pushing for new hepatitis C policy. State officials will present proposed changes regarding the policy but have not disclosed details. “With new drugs coming on the market, we’re exploring how we can treat more without breaking the budget because these are still very expensive drugs,” said department spokesman Marc Williams.",29/07/2016
The Denver Post,How a botched liposuction led to a lawsuit prompting questions about Colorado’s lack of oversight for plastic surgery centers,"Allegations that a botched liposuction sent a patient into heart failure has raised questions about why Colorado allows plastic-surgery centers to operate without state oversight, and whether health officials are putting patients in peril by failing to root out sloppy handling of powerful painkillers and anesthetics.

The lawsuit names as a defendant Elizabeth Lammot Campbell, who provided anesthetic services for several area plastic surgeons.

In a separate, ongoing case, Campbell has admitted to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the Lone Tree Police Department that she stored unsecured drugs in a bag in her car and on a shelf in her garage, court documents show. Many of those drugs had expired. She also told the DEA and police that she may have administered expired drugs to patients, often failed to refrigerate drugs as required and regularly had drugs handed off to her in parking lots.

Authorities were tipped off to Campbell after she returned a purse to a retailer at Park Meadows Mall in May, law enforcement records show. Inside the purse, the clerk found a needle in its package and bottles of the anesthetics Midazolam and Propofol, the same drug linked to the overdose death of Michael Jackson.

In May, Campbell entered into an agreement with the Colorado Nursing Board to suspend her license to practice as a nurse while the board investigates her handling of drugs. Lone Tree police say they still are investigating her.

A lawsuit claims that Campbell provided deficient care to Melinda Van Abbema, 57, a teacher who lives in Golden, during a 2015 liposuction and tummy tuck at the Zwiebel Center for Plastic Surgery and Skin Care in Highlands Ranch. The lawsuit also names as a defendant the plastic surgeon, Dr. Paul Zwiebel.

Zwiebel and Campbell deny the claims and maintain in court documents that they provided Van Abbema proper care. They said in court filings that the surgery that prompted the lawsuit was a rare instance in which emergency personnel had to be called in for assistance.

Zwiebel’s lawyer, Bruce Montoya, said his client knew nothing about Campbell’s issues with storing medication until she informed him that the state was taking action against her nursing license. Montoya added that, contrary to claims in the lawsuit, the complications in Van Abbema’s surgery weren’t related to medication storage issues.

“This is the first time in Dr. Zwiebel’s 33 years of practice that a patient has experienced complications like this in his office,” Montoya said.

Campbell’s lawyers did not return telephone messages seeking comment.

Discoveries in the case highlight why the state should close a gap in how health care facilities in Colorado are regulated, said Hollynd Hoskins, the lawyer suing on behalf of Van Abbema. Plastic-surgery centers are not subject to state licensing requirements — and any inspections — that are required of other health care facilities in Colorado such as ambulatory surgical centers.

“The state is allowing a number of surgical facilities throughout Colorado to be exempt from regulations and avoid oversight requirements and licensing requirements that are very crucial for patient safety and the safe, secure storage and administration of controlled substances,” Hoskins said. “This is a very dangerous interpretation and truly a dangerous exemption. Really this needs to be immediately changed. It’s a crazy loophole.”

At least 20 states require the accreditation or licensing of offices where doctors perform surgeries, including plastic-surgery centers, according to the American Association for the Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities. In 2012, Washington became one of the states that license plastic-surgery centers. In such states, health officials inspect the facilities and track adverse medical events and complaints.

“There was a recognition that there needed to be specific licensing for these types of facilities as more and more of them develop,” said Gordon MacCracken, public information officer with the Washington Department of Public Health. “If they plan to do general anesthesia or provide surgical services, they need to be licensed.”

Plastic-surgery centers escape state regulations in Colorado because they don’t “operate exclusively for the purpose of providing surgical services,” Hoskins said. While surgeries are conducted at those centers, they also offer nonsurgical services, such as Botox injections. Furthermore, Colorado does not consider liposuction procedures as needing strong oversight by the state unless they remove more than 5 percent of body weight.

“It is up to the physician to determine the scope of the services provided and whether or not they fall under office based vs. facility level care,” said Lorraine Dixon-Jones, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

Nurses and doctors at plastic-surgery centers in Colorado are required to hold licenses to practice.

Recent public health scares at hospitals have focused attention on the extreme danger that drug diversions can pose to the public.

Former surgical technologist Rocky Allen was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for stealing a fentanyl syringe intended for an elderly woman about to undergo surgery in January 2015 at Swedish Medical Center. His theft prompted a nationwide health scare when it was revealed he was HIV positive and had been fired from at least five health care facilities in California, Arizona and Washington before Swedish hired him in August 2015.

Cosmetic surgery scandals also have produced headlines in Colorado. Last year, authorities arrested a 36-year-old Denver surgical assistant who was posing as a plastic surgeon and had opened up his own cosmetic surgery clinic. Carlos Hernandez Fernandez pleaded guilty to illegal impersonation and other charges in connection with his painful and shoddy tummy tucks, face-lifts and other medical procedures on women, often conducted without proper anesthesia. He was sentenced to six years in prison.

Zwiebel’s Highlands Ranch center promises on its website that it can “deliver the shape, look and confidence you need.” That website also touts that the center is certified by the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities, an accreditation the website says “ensures you receive the highest possible level of safety and comfort.”

Instead of receiving the body she desired, Van Abbema maintains in the lawsuit that she underwent a nightmare at the Zwiebel center that almost claimed her life. The care at the clinic was so deficient that she probably was administered unsafe drugs by Campbell on Dec. 17, 2015, causing her to go into acute respiratory and heart failure, she claims.

Campbell had administered anesthetics to Van Abbema during the surgery, the lawsuit states. Shortly after emerging from the surgery for liposuction and a tummy tuck, Van Abbema began coughing up pink, frothy sputum, she alleges in the suit, filed in Arapahoe District Court. Campbell then administered Decadron after the surgery, a drug often used to treat breathing problems, the complaint alleges.

Van Abbema reported to the nurses that she felt like she was crawling out of her skin after receiving the Decadron. She then went into severe respiratory and cardiac failure, according to court records. She ended up getting rushed by ambulance to Littleton Adventist Hospital, where she was in intensive care for 39 days. She had to undergo a tracheotomy as surgeons struggled to keep her alive. The wounds from her liposuction reopened, causing infections and requiring numerous followup surgeries, the lawsuit claims. She now struggles with ongoing lung complications due to the lack of oxygen she experienced when she went into cardiac and respiratory failure, according to her complaint.

This isn’t the first time Campbell has been sued in connection with her care at a plastic surgery center. She was sued in 2010 for allegedly administering at another center a toxic dose of anesthesia that permanently damaged the spinal nerves of a woman receiving a liposuction, according to that lawsuit. The woman claimed she went into heart failure and had to be hospitalized. Campbell ended up settling the claims against her in that lawsuit for an undisclosed amount, according to court documents filed in that case. Zwiebel has been sued four times, all of which ended up in settlements, according to state records.

The Denver Post,Stronger oversight of Colorado’s surgical techs under consideration after contamination,"A legislative hearing on state regulation of surgical technologists has been postponed to consider stronger oversight.

Colorado enacted regulatory standards for surgical techs in 2010 after Kristen Parker infected at least 18 people with hepatitis by stealing liquid painkillers and leaving behind dirty needles.

That law is set to expire this year unless legislators vote to extend or amend it.

A hearing was scheduled Wednesday before the House Health, Insurance and Environment Committee, but it was called off.

The state Department of Regulatory Agencies favored “sunsetting” the law as duplicative of hospital and federal oversight. But that was before another surgical tech, Rocky Allen, was fired by Swedish Medical Center last month and charged with fentanyl theft.

Rep. Beth McCann, D-Denver, who leads the committee, said members want to consider legislation that would improve oversight of hospital workers with access to narcotic drugs.

That could include “background checks, better sharing of data,” she said. “Why isn’t there more information available? Why aren’t hospitals sharing information when someone is let go for this kind of behavior?”

McCann expects the hearing to be scheduled in about two weeks.

In the meantime, “we’re going to be talking to health care facilities about some amendments whose goal would be to prevent another such occurrence,” said Diana Protopapa, a lobbyist for surgical technologists and surgical assistants.

She said those facilities include hospitals and surgery centers.

Swedish and three hospitals in California and Arizona where Allen previously worked have offered free blood tests to nearly 5,000 surgery patients for HIV and hepatitis. Allen also worked in Washington state.

A federal court hearing Friday disclosed that Allen carries an unspecified bloodborne pathogen.

Colorado’s association of surgical technologists favors stronger state regulation. In the current program, the state does not perform background checks or verify applicants’ information, and disciplinary actions have been rare.

The Denver Post,A plan for the loyal opposition in the Trump era,"Like the rest of the 53 percent of American voters who did not cast their ballots for Donald Trump, Tim Sweeney is upset about the outcome of the election.

“I’m very distressed about it,” he said, citing Trump’s campaign of lies, insults, threats and attacks on the freedom of the press.

Sweeney, the former president and CEO of the Gill Foundation and one of the most talented political organizers of his generation, says not only is it upsetting that a shameless bigot will occupy the White House, but his appointees represent “a whole ‘nother level of frightening.”

Still, he’s not about to wallow in anger and disgust. “Like Mother Jones taught us, first you mourn, then you organize,” he said.

So, now that the national post-election pity party and family mud-wrestling event (Thanksgiving) is behind us, our period of public mourning is officially over.

Time to get to work.

“We have overcome terrible adversity before,” said Sweeney, whose initiation into political activism came when he was 23. He went to work with Harvey Milk in 1978 on the No on 6 campaign when the measure to ban LGBT people from jobs in public schools in California was considered a slam-dunk.

Seventy percent of California voters favored the measure initially, but Milk was undeterred.

“We built a massive grassroots campaign,” Sweeney recalled. They won with more than 58 percent of the vote.

But there was little time to celebrate. The AIDS epidemic of the 1980s followed, challenging everyone in the LGBT movement to organize as if their lives depended on it.

Because they did.

“That was a period of utter terror,” Sweeney said. “Nobody — nobody — on either side of the political aisle was standing up and supporting the LGBT community.”

In fact, national leaders were openly hostile to AIDS victims. President Reagan’s communications director, Pat Buchanan, called the disease “nature’s revenge on gay men.”

Sweeney and his colleagues doubled down, creating a whole system to care for HIV-infected people when the health care community recoiled in horror, many refusing to treat them at all, abandoning them to die alone.

Congress refused to act and Reagan remained silent, campaigning instead for the so-called Family Protection Act, a shockingly homophobic, anti-women’s rights bill designed to curry favor with the Rev. Jerry Falwell. So LGBT activists took to the streets demanding funds for AIDS research, treatment and prevention.

The organizers built an amazing infrastructure of local and national organizations — the Colorado AIDS Project, ACT-UP, Body Positive, the Treatment Action Group, the AIDS Interfaith Network, the AIDS Action Council — that mobilized a comprehensive, multifaceted response.

“In less than 10 years,” Sweeney said, “we changed the entire political, social and cultural discourse about a deadly disease.”

So given all his experience, I asked Sweeney for advice. What should the loyal opposition do in the Trump era? Where do we go from here?

First, he said, avoid the circular firing squad. “Hillary Clinton’s loss was a death by a thousand cuts.” Quit looking for scapegoats.

Next, “up your empathy quotient. Listen. We need dialogue. That’s the way we changed the way Americans think about marriage equality and LGBT people. We listened and we all gained understanding.”

Learn to “think bigger.” Instead of just railing against your opponents, “you must provide an alternative vision.”

Don’t demonize the other side and “don’t underestimate the ability of people to grow in their heart. “People can rise to their better angels,” he said.

In the 1980s, the conservative Christian Surgeon General C. Everett Koop turned out to be “the unlikeliest of allies” to anti-AIDS activists, he recalled. “He stood up to fear and stigma to do the right thing, and became one of our great champions.

“I have to believe that people within the Republican Party will stop the most vicious and damaging policies that Trump has been promoting.” We need to give Republicans and Democrats both the space to take those brave positions and work inside the system.

And while the Twitter and Facebook sniping may feel good for a moment, if you really want to stop the madness, step up and support the groups, the candidates and the causes that matter most to you, whether it’s organizations to protect the rights of immigrants, women or the LGBT community; the Anti-Defamation League; the ACLU; Planned Parenthood; or conservation groups.

“The best way to not normalize the behavior we’ve seen in the Trump campaign is by being civil,” said Sweeney.

And, of course, if Trump violates cherished social norms and threatens our democracy, “it’s time for strong non-violent civil disobedience,” Sweeney said.

“There is a point when you say, ‘Enough. This is just wrong.’ And you’re willing to get arrested for saying it.”

The Denver Post,Aurora man faces 12 counts in child sex trafficking case,"A 48-year-old Aurora man is accused in a child sex trafficking case involving a 16-year-old who left California to live with the suspect and performed sex acts in exchange for housing, food and assorted gifts, according to court documents.

Sean Travis Crumpler faces two counts of trafficking sexual servitude of a minor, four counts of pattern child sex assault by one in a position of trust, and three counts of sexual contact with a child through coercion.

An affidavit for an arrest warrant was issued Sept. 10.

Crumpler appeared in Arapahoe District Court on Monday. His bail was set at $100,000, records show.

Another 16-year-old male was living at Crumpler’s home, according to the arrest affidavit, along with about a dozen men between 18 and 21. New arrivals at the home would “earn” housing and food through “sex,” the affidavit said.

Investigators zeroed in on Crumpler after one of the 16-year-olds sent a text to his family in California on July 13 from the 720 area code.

The teen told his family he wanted his birth certificate and Social Security information so he could become “emancipated” and travel to Canada.

A Long Beach, Calif., detective traced the phone number to Crumpler’s home in the 23000 block of East Hinsdale Place in Aurora.

According to the affidavit, the 16-year-old began traveling in May with two friends, Ricardo “Ricky” Barron, 19, and Coddie Jesus Favela, 20, who introduced him to Crumpler.

The three had sexual relations with Crumpler at a Long Beach hotel, the affidavit said. Afterward, the 16-year-old told Crumpler his age, and they had sex again. Crumpler purchased gas cards to be used for trips in California and eventually to Colorado.

Crumpler told the 16-year-old: “This is what I like to call hunting,” according to the affidavit. To “find young boys to bring back to the house.” Favela, Barron and the 16-year-old drove through the night from California, arriving at Crumpler’s home May 20.

Crumpler was convicted of a sex crime in January 2004 in California. He registered as a sex offender in Colorado, at the Hinsdale address, on March 31, 2015, according to records.

That was when he moved into the home along with “several other individuals,” according to the affidavit.

He rented the house, according to property records. The two-story home has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms and an estimated value of $605,000.

Neighbor Shelly Smith said it was like “a frat house.”

“There were a lot of teenage boys,” Smith said. “I assumed it was a dad with a couple of boys who were having their friends over a lot.”

Still, she called the owner of the home, she said.

“The story I got from the owner was: It’s a father and son in the tech business. The extra boys were workers, college students, they would bring in from California. They’d do a job for a month and go back.”

Now, after the comings and goings and a police raid, Smith said she would like the block to go back to normal.

The homeowner could not be reached for comment.

A man who lived at the home, Drew Adkins, 21, told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” Adkins told investigators he knew Crumpler was HIV-positive and that he had unprotected sex.

Another house resident, Jonathan Vasquez, 20, told investigators that in June 2014, he was searching online for a male partner who was HIV-positive, the affidavit said. Crumpler responded in November.

Vasquez described Crumpler as an independent engineering contractor from Long Beach. The two hit it off, started an “intimate relationship,” and Crumpler urged Vasquez to quit his job and move to Colorado.

Prosecutors say Crumpler also is charged with one count of a sexual offense with notice of HIV and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.",21/09/2015
The Denver Post,“It’s raining needles”: National drug crisis creates pollution threat,"LOWELL, Mass. — They hide in weeds along hiking trails and in playground grass. They wash into rivers and float downstream to land on beaches. They pepper baseball dugouts, sidewalks and streets. Syringes left by drug users amid the heroin crisis are turning up everywhere.

In Portland, Maine, officials have collected more than 700 needles so far this year, putting them on track to handily exceed the nearly 900 gathered in all of 2016. In March alone, San Francisco collected more than 13,000 syringes, compared with only about 2,900 the same month in 2016.

People, often children, risk getting stuck by discarded needles, raising the prospect they could contract blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis or HIV or be exposed to remnants of heroin or other drugs.

It’s unclear whether anyone has gotten sick, but the reports of children finding the needles can be sickening in their own right. One 6-year-old girl in California mistook a discarded syringe for a thermometer and put it in her mouth; she was unharmed.

“I just want more awareness that this is happening,” said Nancy Holmes, whose 11-year-old daughter stepped on a needle in Santa Cruz, California, while swimming. “You would hear stories about finding needles at the beach or being poked at the beach. But you think that it wouldn’t happen to you. Sure enough.”

They are a growing problem in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, two states that have seen many overdose deaths in recent years.

“We would certainly characterize this as a health hazard,” said Tim Soucy, health director in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city, which collected 570 needles in 2016, the first year it began tracking the problem. It has found 247 needles so far this year.

Needles turn up in places like parks, baseball diamonds, trails and beaches — isolated spots where drug users can gather and attract little attention, and often the same spots used by the public for recreation. The needles are tossed out of carelessness or the fear of being prosecuted for possessing them.

One child was poked by a needle left on the grounds of a Utah elementary school. Another youngster stepped on one while playing on a beach in New Hampshire.

Even if adults or children don’t get sick, they still must endure an unsettling battery of tests to make sure they didn’t catch anything. The girl who put a syringe in her mouth was not poked but had to be tested for hepatitis B and C, her mother said.

Some community advocates are trying to sweep up the pollution.

Rocky Morrison leads a cleanup effort along the Merrimack River, which winds through the old milling city of Lowell, and has recovered hundreds of needles in abandoned homeless camps that dot the banks, as well as in piles of debris that collect in floating booms he recently started setting.

He has a collection of several hundred needles in a fishbowl, a prop he uses to illustrate that the problem is real and that towns must do more to combat it.

“We started seeing it last year here and there. But now, it’s just raining needles everywhere we go,” said Morrison, a burly, tattooed construction worker whose Clean River Project has six boats working parts of the 117-mile (188-kilometer) river.

Among the oldest tracking programs is in Santa Cruz, California, where the community group Take Back Santa Cruz has reported finding more than 14,500 needles in the county over the past 4 1/2 years. It says it has gotten reports of 12 people getting stuck, half of them children.

“It’s become pretty commonplace to find them. We call it a rite of passage for a child to find their first needle,” said Gabrielle Korte, a member of the group’s needle team. “It’s very depressing. It’s infuriating. It’s just gross.”

Some experts say the problem will ease only when more users get treatment and more funding is directed to treatment programs.

Others are counting on needle exchange programs, now present in more than 30 states, or the creation of safe spaces to shoot up — already introduced in Canada and proposed by U.S. state and city officials from New York to Seattle.

Studies have found that needle exchange programs can reduce pollution, said Don Des Jarlais, a researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai hospital in New York.

But Morrison and Korte complain poor supervision at needle exchanges will simply put more syringes in the hands of people who may not dispose of them properly.

After complaints of discarded needles, Santa Cruz County took over its exchange from a nonprofit in 2013 and implemented changes. It did away with mobile exchanges and stopped allowing drug users to get needles without turning in an equal number of used ones, said Jason Hoppin, a spokesman for Santa Cruz County.

Along the Merrimack, nearly three dozen riverfront towns are debating how to stem the flow of needles. Two regional planning commissions are drafting a request for proposals for a cleanup plan. They hope to have it ready by the end of July.

“We are all trying to get a grip on the problem,” said Haverhill Mayor James Fiorentini. “The stuff comes from somewhere. If we can work together to stop it at the source, I am all for it.”",18/07/2017
The Denver Post,Davidson: Superheroes mixed with debutantes at this year’s Le Bal de Ballet,"What do Ghostbusters, Wonder Woman and Superman have in common with debutantes and Young Men of Distinction?

Nothing, save for this one evening in June when Comic Con and Le Bal de Ballet were taking place simultaneously, in venues a stone’s throw apart.

It made for an interesting moment when random super heroes in full costume, walking from the Colorado Convention Center to cars parked in the Denver Performing Arts Complex garage, needed to negotiate a galleria filled with debutantes, Young Men of Distinction and several hundred parents, friends and extended family done up in evening gowns and tuxedos.

And it was tough to tell which group found the other more amusing.

The Denver Post,Three more hospitals that employed Rocky Allen face patient lawsuits,"Three more hospitals that employed former surgical technologist Rocky Allen face lawsuits alleging they failed to protect patients from a fentanyl addict with a blood disease.

In Arizona, lawyer James Avery filed suit Friday against two hospitals that employed Allen in 2014 — Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale and HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix.

He also notified the state of Washington last week of an intent to sue Northwest Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle on behalf of surgery patients during Allen’s employment there.

Karen Peck, a Northwest Hospital spokeswoman, denied that the hospital acted negligently in hiring Allen.

“We did a Washington state criminal background check,” she said. “We confirmed his registration as a surgical tech. We also conducted a personal reference check.”

His Navy references checked out, she said, and nobody mentioned that he had been court-martialed for stealing fentanyl at an Army base overseas.

The Arizona hospitals did not respond to requests for comment.

Allen, 28, has been charged in Colorado with stealing fentanyl from Swedish Medical Center in Englewood and replacing it with a syringe containing none of the powerful narcotic painkiller. He carries a bloodborne pathogen, according to a federal court disclosure that did not name the disease.

Altogether, about 5,000 patients in Colorado, Arizona, Washington and California have been offered free blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

To date, no hospital has confirmed that Allen infected anyone. He has pleaded not guilty to felony charges in Colorado.

Avery also sued Swedish on behalf of 36 of about 2,900 patients offered blood tests.

In Arizona, the case “involves an indescribable nightmare imposed on a vulnerable group of people — hospital patients undergoing surgery,” he wrote.

He accused the hospitals of hiring Allen “without adequately conducting a background check, without adequately supervising him and without putting in place adequate safeguards to protect the patients entrusted to their care.”

Allen was employed by and fired by both Arizona hospitals between May and September 2014, three years after he was court-martialed for fentanyl theft while deployed in Afghanistan, the lawsuit says.

It names six plaintiffs — four patients and two spouses — as subjected to emotional distress and a risk of infection.",28/03/2016
The Denver Post,Q&A: Former Orlando GLBT executive director talks about the Pulse shooting and creating a playbook for mass shootings,"On a June night in 2016, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded 58 others at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Nineteen months later, both the city of Orlando and the LGBTQ communities are still trying to heal.

At the time, Terry DeCarlo was executive director of the GLBT Center of Central Florida, which offered a hotline for information, rides to blood banks and counseling to help victims and friends, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

DeCarlo, who has since reduced his role at the center to communications director because of health problems, was in Denver earlier this month to kick off the Outspoken Speaker Series, put on by both the GLBT Community Center of Colorado and the LGBTQ Student Resource Center on the Auraria campus.

Before his talk, DeCarlo sat down at the GLBT Center to chat with The Denver Post.

DeCarlo’s responses have been edited for brevity.

Denver Post: What is the thrust of your speech here at the GLBT Center?

Terry DeCarlo: I want to get across … how important this building is. Had our center not been there that morning, people would not have known where to go.

The city of Orlando woke up to something horrendous. They were crying, they didn’t know where to go, what to do. They knew they wanted to help. A lot of people sitting at home just by themselves, they needed to get out and they needed to know where to go, “What do I do?” — and they converged on the center.

And it’s so important for the community to have a place like this that they can run to should something God forbid happen here in this city.

It’s more than 18 months after the tragedy and people still think everybody’s moved on, life is glorious, everybody’s gone back to work. They don’t realize one of our survivors just had his hip replaced for the third time two weeks ago. Another survivor is having another surgery on his head in a matter of weeks.

DP: You said that a lot of people had come to the center that morning. What were they needing? What were they searching for?

DeCarlo: It was so many different things. People were hurting. They were looking for a hug. You had the people who said, “This is my city. I need to do something.”

And then you had people who just wanted to donate. They knew that we were in dire need, and we had a line of cars around the block about three times.

We had to make a plan. There was no playbook for any of this. We did this all on the fly. As (bottles of water) came in the back door, we had people clock it in, take it to the front door, we had someone with a clipboard of all the locations. Where are the families? Where are the blood banks? Where are the first responders? Where are the hospitals?

I had between 400 and 600 people in the center at any one time and it never stopped. They just kept coming. As one person would leave, three would come in. And they did that for two weeks.

DP: Are there centers now that reach out to you that say, “Hey, what should our playbook be?”

DeCarlo: Yeah, it happens a lot. We haven’t finished our playbook. Now, I said we’re more than 18 months. We’re doing our part, but the city, the police department and the sheriff’s office got wind that we were doing a playbook and said, “Let us put our own portion in.”

So we’re combining everything in Orlando so we can give it out to the cities — not only the LGBT centers but everybody who wants one can have a playbook.

After (the shootings) in Manchester, England, happened, I got a call from Manchester saying, “How did you do this?” After (shootings in) Texas happened and then even after Los Vegas, we got the calls. We started to guide them.

DP: Historically, what has been the role of an LGBT center? For you guys, how did that change after the shooting?

DeCarlo: Our center was, as many centers are, a support system for the community. One of the main things that we do, we’re the largest HIV tester in Florida. We expanded up to Hep C and STD because we were doing so many. We have 24 support groups. We have AA, NA … they’re all there. We’re there to support the community. What they want, we do.

That’s what the center has always been and was in Orlando. That day, the center became something that we never thought it could be. It became known worldwide. President Obama called the center out, calling us ground zero for community healing. To have the president of the United States call out a tiny little center in Orlando means we accomplished something.

I don’t know how we did it.

Everybody knew where the center was before, but weren’t quite sure that they needed it. They realized that day, that’s what that building’s there for. It’s there to help us, support us.

Did our mission change? Yeah, we had to go a lot bigger. From being in the bubble that we were in — our STD testing, our community groups — we had to reach out and realize we’re not only here for the LGBT community but everybody now. It was a big undertaking. It took its toll on all of us. (Note: DeCarlo suffered a heart attack after the shootings, forcing him to step down from his role as executive director of the center.)

DP: When you’re talking about Orlando, what are some of the toughest things for you to talk about?

DeCarlo: That day. Losing three of our good friends.

Just two weeks before this happened, it was Gay Days at Disney. (My husband) Bill and I help produce One Magical Weekend. We worked the whole weekend with one of our friends. He was in the club that night and never made it out.

Losing your friends, it’s a hard thing.

One of my board of directors works for One Blood, the blood bank down south. About three blocks from Pulse is one of their places to go. They opened that morning knowing they were going to be deluged with people.

The staff showed up and couldn’t get in, the manager hadn’t showed. So they got somebody there to open the place. They got up and running. The line started going. About 2½ hours into it, they found out that the reason the manager wasn’t there was because he was laying inside the bar. Imagine going to work and finding out somebody you were just with yesterday is (dead).

It’s hard to talk about that. Those images play back in your head when you see a mom yelling her son or daughter’s name and running down the street. And you grab them because the press is behind them and that’s not a time for somebody to put a microphone in front of them and you grab that mom and push her into a building and you ask the people to please hold the door closed so the press can’t get in.

Seeing bloody clothes on the side of the street. You sit there that morning and you keep pinching yourself and you say “this can’t be happening” and all of a sudden, roaring down the street is the SWAT truck that you see in movies, guys hanging off with the helmets, and you think to yourself, “This can’t be real life. You only see this stuff in movies.’ And then you realize it is true. It’s really happening.

DP: Any final thoughts?

DeCarlo: Always make sure you tell your loved ones you love them. You never know what’s going to happen in an instant.

These kids just went out to have a good time, to celebrate birthdays. They never came home. One of my survivors lost his mom. She was holding his hand and at the rush for the door, they were making their way out the door and their hands let go. He made it out, she didn’t. Make sure they know you love them.

If you’re going to fight with somebody, get over it. Heal. But always tell them you love them. Simple as that.

The Outspoken series has five more speakers scheduled. All the lectures begin at 7 p.m. at the Tivoli Student Union Multicultural Lounge on the Auraria Campus.",25/01/2018
The Denver Post,Nurse accused of stealing fentanyl from Summit County hospital,"A Summit County nurse has been arrested on suspicion of stealing the narcotic fentanyl from St. Anthony Summit Medical Center.

Kimberly Jeanne Burgans, 47, surrendered at the Summit County Sheriff’s Office on Saturday. She is charged with obtaining a controlled substance by fraud or deceit and theft, according to a news release from the Fifth Judicial District Attorney’s Office. Burgans, who has been licensed since January 2014 by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Affairs, was fired Jan. 28 from the Breckenridge hospital, the district attorney reported. Sheriff’s deputies were called to the hospital on Jan. 30 after receiving reports that Burgans had a physical test indicating the presence of fentanyl. She did not have a prescription for the drug, the DA’s office said.

She is suspected of misappropriating doses of injectable hydromorphone fentanyl intended for Summit Medical Center patients she was attending to, the news release said. She was found between December and January to have fentanyl doses in her possession that exceeded the amounts usually needed by hospital nurses for their patients.

District Attorney Bruce Brown said in the news release the investigation is ongoing to determine the extent of the misappropriation of the drug. Filing of formal charges is pending.

“Nationwide, drug misappropriation by hospital staff is rising at an alarming rate resulting in serious concerns about the extent of prescription drug abuse by professionals,” Brown said.

Fentanyl abuse has made headlines in Denver this year after Rocky Allen, a former surgical technologist at Swedish Medical Center, was accused of stealing the powerful narcotic from an operating room at the Englewood hospital. Allen was charged in federal court with tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit. He has pleaded not guilty.

His case has prompted wide-scale HIV and hepatitis B testing of Swedish patients. Allen is carrying a blood-borne pathogen, although specifics have not been released. Allen was fired from at least five hospitals where he worked in California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado.

One hospital said it found him swapping a doctor’s fentanyl syringe with a syringe of saline solution and informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

He also was court-martialed by the Navy in 2011 after he was caught stealing the drug at a military combat hospital in Afghanistan.",19/03/2016
The Denver Post,Louisiana medical marijuana expansion bill signed into law,"BATON ROUGE — Katie Corkern couldn t stop smiling Thursday, confident that relief for her son s uncontrollable seizures may finally be near.

Corkern, her son Connor and the rest of her family stood near Gov. John Bel Edwards as he signed a bill to kick-start and expand the Louisiana medical marijuana program, which has been slow to begin because of regulatory hurdles.

I m very excited for the future. And I m very excited for all the people this medicine can help, the mother and advocate said after the bill signing.

The governor said the program will have a dramatic effect on Louisiana s families.

It simply is unacceptable to tell parents of kids especially that if they want to make available to their kids the medicine that is being recommended by their doctors in order to achieve some better quality of life, some reduction in pain or other symptoms, that they have to move, Edwards said.

The bill by Republican Sen. Fred Mills, a St. Martin Parish pharmacist, will broaden the existing program to cover more diseases and make regulatory changes aimed at getting marijuana — in an oil form that can t be smoked — into patients hands more quickly.

Sheriffs and district attorneys opposed the bill as opening the door to eventually legalizing recreational marijuana.

Edwards described the measure as having tight controls so it won t become a medication that is recommended for every ailment that is out there.

Lawmakers sided with parents who said their children s medical conditions could be helped with therapeutic marijuana, who talked of moving to Colorado to lessen their children s suffering and who launched billboards and social media campaigns for the bill.

Corkern and her son, who has a rare brain disorder that causes repeated seizures, were on one of those billboards and were a regular presence around the Louisiana Capitol.

Connor s neurologist in New Orleans feels (medical marijuana) is the last resort for him in order to control his seizures, because we ve obviously tried everything and the meds just aren t working for him. They re making his body waste away, Corkern said.

The Corkerns are from Edwards hometown of Amite and attend the same church as the governor, and they had a significant advocate on their side — the governor s wife Donna — who attended committee hearings with Katie Corkern and who was on hand for the bill signing.

In terms of lobbying the governor, nobody did that more effectively than Donna did over the last couple of months, Edwards said.

The law passed last year will eventually get medicinal-grade pot to people suffering from cancer and a severe form of cerebral palsy. Mills bill adds seizure disorders, HIV, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and other diseases to the list.

The bill also sets a Sept. 1 deadline for LSU and Southern University to decide if they want to be the state-sanctioned grower of the product, in an effort to speed the decision-making since the schools get first right of refusal to grow the plant.

It also reworks some of the regulatory language to address doctors concerns about running afoul of federal drug regulations, allowing a physician to recommend use of therapeutic marijuana, rather than prescribe the drug.

Mills has estimated Louisiana is 18 months to 24 months from getting medical marijuana to patients. The state-sanctioned grower needs to be selected, along with 10 distributors.

Corkern said the wait was now tolerable: Knowing that I don t have to fight for it to become legal, that makes the waiting easier.

Lawmakers created the framework for a medical marijuana program in Louisiana last year, but regulatory hurdles built into the law have slowed its start.

Bill supporters describe children struggling with uncontrollable seizures and patients coping with horrible pain. They said the program only allows medical marijuana in an oil form that can t be smoked. Local sheriffs and district attorneys oppose expansion, calling it a gateway to unfettered, recreational use of marijuana.

Rep. Reid Falconer, R-Mandeville, talked of his precious daughter, who has epilepsy and who has been unable to find medications that end her seizures.

This bill will enable our doctor to have another tool to treat my baby girl, he told his colleagues.

During the evening debate, bill supporter Katie Corkern sat in the back of the House chamber with her son Connor, who uses a wheelchair and has a rare brain disorder that causes uncontrollable seizures.

As he urged passage, Rep. Sam Jones talked of Corkern s son: Since we began this debate, there is one child in this chamber who has had eight seizures.

Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Gray, said federal drug regulators haven t approved medical marijuana, so doctors won t have guidance on dosage or standards to apply.

How is it that the doctors are going to know what to give to the patients? she asked.

Rep. Scott Simon, R-Abita Springs, voted against the proposal, saying he worried about public safety, that we re working our way toward legalization of marijuana.

His colleague, Rep. Terry Landry, a former state police superintendent, dismissed such concerns as nonsense and fear-mongering.

We re really talking about suffering here, said Landry, D-New Iberia. We re not talking about a gateway to a legal drug.

The medical marijuana law passed last year will eventually get medical-grade pot to people suffering from cancer, glaucoma and a severe form of cerebral palsy. Mills proposal would add seizure disorders, HIV, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and other diseases to the list. It would remove glaucoma, in response to opposition.

The bill also would set a Sept. 1 deadline for LSU and Southern University to decide if they want to be the state-sanctioned grower of the product, in an effort to speed the decision-making since the schools get first right of refusal to grow the plant. It also would rework some of the regulatory language.

Mills has estimated Louisiana is about two years away from getting medical marijuana to patients. The state-sanctioned grower needs to be selected, along with 10 licensed distributors.

The Denver Post,"Colorado to expand coverage for Hep C patients, but some still won’t get the expensive drug","Colorado will increase access to a life-saving, expensive hepatitis C drug, covering needy patients in earlier stages of liver disease than were previously considered, the state Medicaid department said Thursday.

The decision comes after criticism from the ACLU Colorado and Denver Health medical center and a recommendation from the state drug review board, which provides guidance on drug coverage for the state insurance program for needy Coloradans.

The state has paid for the 12-week drug treatment — which has a 90 percent cure rate — only for patients who were in the final two stages of liver disease. Under the new policy, Medicaid patients can receive the drug if their liver damage has advanced to the second out of five stages — zero meaning no liver damage and four diagnosed as cirrhosis.

The policy also expands coverage to women who plan to become pregnant within the next year, regardless of the stage of their liver scarring. And it loosens a previous restriction barring anyone who used alcohol or illegal drugs within the previous six months. Now people with a history of chronic substance abuse will have to enroll in drug treatment counseling at least one month before receiving the hepatitis C regime.

Critics of the old policy pointed to the fact that most new cases of hepatitis C involved people who are substance abusers and share needles. Treating people who are spreading the virus through needles is the “most important way to stop the spread and slow this epidemic around the country,” said Dr. Sarah Rowan, associate director of HIV and viral hepatitis prevention at Denver Public Health.

Rowan called the new policy a “huge improvement” and a “great step in the right direction” but said she hopes the state moves toward covering all Medicaid beneficiaries with the virus, as private insurance already does.

The ACLU, which has threatened a lawsuit, argued it is illegal to withhold treatment until people suffer “irreparable liver damage” because of the high cost of the drug.

“This is a definite improvement over the past restrictions, but unfortunately it doesn’t go far enough,” said ACLU legal director Mark Silverstein. “It still leaves many people with hepatitis C without treatment — treatment that is medically necessary and is being denied for reasons that are not medical reasons.”

State officials, though, said they are relying on clinical judgment within the department and from other physicians, and that some people with hepatitis C never advance beyond the first stage.

“We believe this is a reasonable policy,” said Dr. Judy Zerzan, chief medical officer of the state Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.

The state now counts 14,400 Coloradans with Medicaid who are infected with the blood-borne virus. An estimated 70 percent of those have liver disease at stage two or higher.

Based on data from other states, Colorado officials estimate about 20 percent of Medicaid patients with hepatitis C will seek treatment within the next year, at a cost of about $47.5 million in state funds. Zerzan said the average treatment cost per person so far has been $86,700. That includes state and federal funds but does not factor in rebates from the drug manufacturers, which the Medicaid department does not disclose for proprietary reasons.

So far, Colorado’s Medicaid department has treated 413 people with the drug at a cost of $35.8 million, not including those undisclosed rebates. About 80 patients were treated in the past two months, an uptick Zerzan attributed to publicity about the drug coverage issue.

The cost of the treatment regime is expected to come down during the next few months and years, as competing drugs enter the market.

Until a few years ago, the best treatment for hepatitis C included toxic injections that went on for a year, had an estimated cure rate of only 50 percent and included side effects such as bone pain, memory loss, depression and nausea. That all changed when a drug called Sovaldi was approved in 2013, providing 12 weeks of therapy without the excruciating side effects and a 90 percent success rate.",01/09/2016
The Denver Post,Congress must stop playing politics with Zika funding,"When fighting disease becomes political, chaos is never far behind.

For months now, public health experts and scientists have been sounding the alarm over the steady march of the Zika virus toward the U.S. They even predicted where it would make landfall — Florida, Texas, New York.

And they were right.

There have been six cases of the mosquito-borne virus reported so far in Florida, and New York has seen 530 cases related to travel.

So what are we doing about it?

Well, right now, we’re doing what we do best when a public health crisis hits this country — playing politics.

In February, President Obama asked Congress for $1.9 billion to address the budding threat of Zika following the advice of his experts at the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health. But once again the Republican-led Congress is dragging its feet. It waited four months to respond and then provided just two-thirds of the requested funding.

And they made sure to load up the bill with limits on contraception for women and cuts in important federal health programs.

The result? Zika is here and there isn’t enough money to contain it.

If you want to understand what that means, consider Puerto Rico with more than 7,000 cases and counting. We now await the consequences of these infections on the children and fetuses of the affected mothers. Zika does little to adults but can cause permanent brain damage to the young and the unborn.

As a pediatrician and public health researcher, I have seen this up close.

In the hot, humid lowlands of southwest Guatemala, I help run a clinic where the Colorado School of Public Health and Children’s Hospital Colorado have been doing research to find out how much mosquito-borne infections affect the villagers. It’s called the Center for Human Development and sits on a banana plantation surrounded by nearly 28,000 people. Our testing has found out that two of every three children have already suffered from Zika this past year. That’s stunning. So this infection spreads like a plague, except that there is no vaccine, no cure for microcephaly and nowhere to hide. And don’t think it won’t happen here. It already has.

Yet rather than mobilize against this threat we are taking the familiar road of political stonewalling.

We know what happens when we do too little and act too late in the face of infectious disease. In 1981, as President Ronald Regan completed his first year in office, the AIDS epidemic entered the history books as one of the most feared and costly diseases ever fought. The Reagan administration provided scant funding to study and combat the deadly HIV virus, which was stigmatized as a disease of gays and Haitian immigrants. Millions of people were infected, including Hollywood stars, famous singers, sportsmen, wives, husbands and children. Thirty-five years and more than $440 billion later, we have transformed what had been a death sentence to an often manageable illness.

In 2014, the Ebola virus sparked panic here and reminded the global public health community that we are not up to the challenge of early detection and response. The late implementation of surveillance, diagnosis and control led to 28,616 cases of Ebola in West Africa, 11,310 deaths, and close to $5 billion spent to contain this international health emergency.

When fighting disease becomes political, chaos is never far behind. Perhaps it will take the expansion of the Zika outbreak in the American South, with its resulting panic, for lawmakers to act with common sense rather than political calculation.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration is frantically shifting funds from cancer research and the fight on poverty to the development of a Zika vaccine that could be priceless if the outbreak becomes widespread in this country. The stubbornness of Congress to provide the necessary funding to scientists and public health agencies to contain Zika is even more astonishing if you consider that we are now entering the peak mosquito season, which runs from August to October.

Lawmakers have a constitutional and moral obligation to provide the means to battle this epidemic. If all they understand is politics, they might consider the backlash that could befall them if Southern states like Florida and Texas see Zika outbreaks. Who will the citizens hold responsible for failing to protect them?

So Congress, do your job and vote for more Zika funding. This virus is here, it’s spreading and it’s not colored blue or red.

The Denver Post,Winners and losers in Trump’s first budget plan,"By Calvin Woodward, The Associated Press

WASHINGTON – Military spending would get the biggest boost in President Donald Trump’s proposed budget. Environmental programs, medical research, Amtrak and an array of international and cultural programs — from Appalachia to the arts — would take big hits, among the many parts of the government he’d put on a crash diet.

The budget proposal out Thursday is a White House wish list; it’ll be up to Congress to decide where money goes. If Trump gets his way, there will be more losers than winners among government departments and programs.—

Some programs would tread water: WIC grants — money to states for health care and nutrition for low-income women, infants and children — are one example.— Money for state grants for water infrastructure projects would be held level as well. The plan would keep money flowing to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a leading global effort to provide treatment for victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, mainly in Africa.

Some programs would lose everything: Trump proposes to eliminate money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the national endowments for arts and humanities and more than a dozen other independent agencies financed by the government.

A sampling:

WINNERS

—The Pentagon. Trump proposes a 10 percent increase in the massive defense budget, with an extra $52 billion going to accelerate the war against the Islamic State group and address insufficient weapons stocks, personnel gaps, deferred maintenance and cyber vulnerabilities.— An additional $2 billion would go to nuclear weapons.

—Veterans Affairs. Up 5.9 percent. That’s an additional $4.4 billion, driven by ever-growing health care costs. The plan would allocate $3.5 billion to extend an expiring Veterans Choice program, which allows eligible veterans to seek care from a private doctor outside the VA network.

—Homeland Security. Up 6.8 percent. That’s $2.8 billion more. Most of the increase, $2.6 billion, would be to help kick-start Trump’s promised border wall. The president has repeatedly said Mexico would pay for the wall; Mexican officials are adamant that they won’t. Trump also wants an extra $1.5 billion for more immigration jails and deportations, and $314 million to hire 1,500 immigration enforcement and border patrol agents.

—The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the maintenance and safety of the nuclear arsenal and its research labs. The agency would grow by 11.3 percent, or $1.4 billion, so that it takes up more than half the Energy Department’s budget, which would shrink overall.

—Opioid prevention and treatment: a proposed $500 million increase in the Health and Human Services Department to counter the epidemic and more money for the Justice Department to combat the problem.

—School choice: $1.4 billion more to expand school choice programs, bringing spending in that area to $20 billion, even as the Education Department’s overall budget would be cut by $9 billion, or 13 percent.

LOSERS:

—EPA, facing a 31.4 percent cut, or $2.6 billion. The plan would cut 3,200 jobs at the agency, eliminate a new plan for tighter regulations on power plants, and “zero out” programs to clean up the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay. EPA climate change research would be eliminated. Grants for state and local drinking and wastewater projects would be preserved.

—Health and Human Services, facing a $12.6 billion cut, or 16.2 percent. The plan would cut $5.8 billion from the nearly $32 billion National Institutes of Health, the nation’s premier medical research agency, bringing its total to $25.9 billion. It’s not clear what research on diseases or disorders would lose the most money, although the budget plan specifically calls for elimination of a division that focuses on global health. Already, the NIH’s budget hasn’t kept pace with inflation over the last decade, making it dramatically harder for scientists around the country to win money for research projects into potential new treatments or better understanding of disease.

—State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development. Down 31 percent, or $17 billion. Foreign aid would be reduced, as would money to the U.N. and to multilateral development banks including the World Bank. Some foreign military grants would be shifted to loans. Money would be cut off to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which helps developing nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to other U.N. climate change programs

—Labor Department. A more than 20 percent cut, or $2.5 billion. To be eliminated: a $434 million program that has helped more than 1 million people 55 and older find jobs, according to the department. The blueprint says the Senior Community Service Employment Program is inefficient and unproven.

—Agriculture Department. A nearly 21 percent cut, or $4.7 billion, achieved in part by cutting land acquisition in the National Forest System, rural water infrastructure and statistical capabilities at the department. Trump also proposes reduced staff in county USDA offices, an idea that fell flat in Congress when President Barack Obama proposed a similar reduction.

—Transportation Department. Trump proposes a cut of nearly 13 percent, or $2.4 billion. Amtrak, local transit agencies, and rural communities that depend on federal subsidies to obtain scheduled airline service would take the brunt. Trump would eliminate subsidies for Amtrak long-distance train routes, which would most likely mean the end of those routes since they are generally not profitable. Money for the Federal Transit Administration grant program for new light rail and subway construction would be eliminated except for multi-year projects the government has already committed to help fund.

—Internal Revenue Service: After years of cuts, the IRS budget would be cut again — by $239 million from this year’s spending levels. The IRS budget is down about $1 billion from its height in 2010. Since then, the agency has lost more than 17,000 employees. As a result, the chances of getting audited have rarely been so low.

—Commerce Department. A 16 percent or $1.5 billion cut. The plan would eliminate more than $250 million in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grants, including a program that helps coastal communities adapt to climate change, deal with invasive species and maintain healthy water and fisheries. Also on the chopping block: the Economic Development Administration, which provides federal dollars to foster job creation and attract private investment; and the Minority Business Development Agency, which is dedicated to helping minority-owned business get off the ground and grow. The Trump administration says the two agencies duplicate work done elsewhere.

—School programs: The plan would eliminate two programs worth $3.6 billion that provide money for teacher preparation and after-school programs.

—Independent agencies supported by tax dollars.— If Trump prevails, a hefty contingent of entities would lose all federal money and be shut. Among them, the Public Broadcasting Corporation, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Chemical Safety Board, the United States Institute of Peace, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for National Community Service and the African Development Foundation. That foundation was established by Congress and provides seed money and other support to enterprises in some 20 countries on that continent.

The Denver Post,Michael Kors honored for his fashionable philanthropy,"WASHINGTON — Fashion has been very good to Michael Kors. Over the last 35 years, the designer has made himself a nice little fortune by turning his daydreams about Aspen, Montauk, sporty socialites, minimalism and cashmere into a billion-dollar fashion empire. He has built a fine life with a handsome husband, a client list that includes Michelle Obama, and the affections of countless professional women walking around town with an MK handbag draped over an arm.

And yet: “It’s nice when something takes your head away from major decisions about flat-front (pants) or pleats,” says the former “Project Runway” judge.

For Kors, the topic that diverts his attention is hunger. On Tuesday, he was honored in Washington with the McGovern-Dole Leadership award for his work with the United Nations’ World Food Program. As one of its global ambassadors, he’s helped to raise funds to deliver more than 10 million meals to children around the globe.

“Do you know what I’m wearing?” asks Kors with eager glee. “I’m wearing nude pantyhose, mid-heel navy pumps and a boxy navy suit!”

Ha-ha, a little joke about Washington’s stereotypical power woman uniform. Kors laughs, “I’ll break the Internet!”

Of course, that look no longer dominates Washington style. Fashion’s broad reach has introduced the most eccentric designs into the most conservative corners of this city. The style of urban nomads is found in suburban cul-de-sacs. Prada fans in Johannesburg have their own shop. Louis Vuitton has stores everywhere from Paris to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. As fashion becomes more global, so do the concerns and responsibilities of its designers.

“Back in the ’80s, I was an American designer designing for an American consumer. There were such distinct borders. Japanese fashion was for the Japanese. British fashion was for the quirky British,” says Kors, who grew up on Long Island. “When I first started, I thought global meant Toronto. I thought I was going some place exotic if I went to Houston.”

“In the ’90s, the Berlin wall of of fashion came down. I was commuting back and forth (designing) for Céline (in Paris). Trunk shows weren’t just in Palm Beach or Los Angeles. I was going to Singapore. I started seeing the world.”

Early in his career, Kors focused on hunger in his hometown. The New York-based nonprofit God’s Love We Deliver, which provides meals for those who are ill, last year dedicated a building to the designer who, along with his company, has raised some $20 million for the organization. But as his reach as a designer has expanded, so has his philanthropy.

The fashion industry has taken on a host of causes, from raising money to fight ovarian cancer to designer Prabal Gurung leading a fundraising effort in the aftermath of the earthquake in Nepal. But if there is any designer who serves as a role model for Kors when it came to philanthropy, it’s Donna Karan.

“I’ve known Donna Karan since I was 18,” Kors says. “I think of the first 7th on Sale back in 1990,” which raised money to fight HIV/AIDS. “I was setting up my little booth and there were big corporations setting up booths. I thought, look at what Donna and (Vogue’s) Anna Wintour have done here. In (hindsight) it sounds like such a simple idea: We have products. Let’s sell our products and raise money.”

Kors continues to travel, hosting trunk shows and talking to customers. Like a lot of designers, he’s trying to figure out whether customers have the patience to wait six months to buy something they see on the runway and in tweets today. And what he has determined so far is this: It depends.",13/04/2016
The Denver Post,"To understand life expectancy decline in the U.S., start in West Virginia","MADISON, W.Va. — If you want to understand why U.S. life expectancy is declining, West Virginia is a good place to start.

The state is a bellwether of bad health, portending major problems years before they became severe nationally.

“It seems that the worst outcomes happen here first,” said Dr. Michael Brumage, a West Virginia University public health expert who formerly ran the health department in Charleston. “We’re the canary in the coal mine.”

The drug overdose death rate for all Americans today is where West Virginia’s rate was 10 years ago. The nation’s suicide rate is where West Virginia’s was nearly 20 years ago.

Obesity was common in West Virginia before it became widespread in the rest of the country. And life expectancy started tumbling in the Mountain State before it began falling across the U.S.

Maggie Hill has lived in the state for all of her 67 years. Sitting in her cabin in the town of Madison recently, she ticked off the many deaths that have befallen her family: An older brother drowned in a flood in 1977. A sister died in a house fire. Two siblings, both smokers, died of lung cancer. Two others were stillborn. Her first husband died of congestive heart failure.

Then there were the suicides. Two of her three sons shot themselves to death, one of them after losing his job. Her second husband died the same way, using a gun in their bedroom closet one Sunday morning while she was still in bed.

“I don’t think people have a lot to live for,” she said. “I really and truly don’t see things getting better.”

Life expectancy

After decades of steady increases, U.S. life expectancy has been declining since 2014. A government report released last month said the trend continued last year, driven in part by suicides and drug overdoses — the so-called diseases of despair.

What else is driving the decline? Experts say America’s obesity problem has worsened the diabetes death rate and helped stall progress against the nation’s leading killer, heart disease.

West Virginia eclipses most other states in the percentage of people affected by diabetes, heart disease and obesity. It has had the nation’s highest rate of drug overdose deaths for years running. It also has the highest obesity rate and the highest rates of diabetes and high blood pressure. Adding to those woes is the highest suicide rate among states east of the Mississippi River.

Earlier this fall, U.S. health officials released for the first time life expectancy predictions at a neighborhood level. An Associated Press analysis of the data found wide disparities in cities and towns. Among states, the AP found, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy. West Virginia was the second lowest, behind Mississippi.

Mississippi, Oklahoma and a few other states suffer death and disease rates that are about as bad — or sometimes worse. But those places have unusually large populations of low-income black or Native American people, who suffer a disproportionate share of disability, disease and death.

West Virginia is 94 percent white. That makes it a telling indicator. Nearly 80 percent of the Americans who die each year are white people, and death rates rose in white men and women last year but were flat or falling in blacks and Hispanics.

So white deaths — particularly those of people who are not elderly — are mainly responsible for the nation’s declining life expectancy.

Widespread attention

Ten years ago, The Associated Press described Huntington, West Virginia, and its environs as the unhealthiest place in America , based on health survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that put it at the bottom of the charts in more than a half-dozen measures, including the highest proportions of people who were obese, had diabetes and had heart disease.

The AP report, and others like it, drew widespread attention that peaked in 2010, when celebrity chef Jamie Oliver staged a reality TV show in Huntington to teach people how to eat better.

The attention was not entirely welcomed. It felt like outsiders coming in to criticize and perpetuate “hillbilly” stereotypes, said Steve Williams, who was elected Huntington’s mayor in 2012.

But Williams said it also was motivating, prompting changes in school food and even improvements to parks and sidewalks.

“We get slammed all the time with obesity,” said Andy Fischer, a financial adviser who organized a 2,500-person community walking program. “We’ve got to get better.”

These days, the Huntington area looks somewhat better in government health surveys. For example, the region’s obesity rate is only a few percentage points above the national median — instead of 10 or 20 points.

That said, it’s clear the Huntington area still has some big problems. It ranks among the worst metro areas in measures like the percentage of adults who smoke, have high blood pressure and have had a stroke.

Opioids and obesity

About the time Huntington was trying to tackle its weight problem, it was rocked by a new crisis — opioid addiction.

West Virginia now has the distinction of having the nation’s highest drug overdose death rate. Last year, for the first time, the state’s body count surpassed 1,000. The epidemic also produced ripple effects such as a spike in the number of children taken into foster care because of dead or addicted parents.

In the last two years, no West Virginia county has seen more overdose deaths than Cabell County, which includes Huntington.

One of the grimmest spots has been Huntington’s West End — some locals call it “the Worst End.” The AP analysis of neighborhood-level death data found the area had a life expectancy at birth of only 62 years, 16 years shorter than national life expectancy.

Huntington’s reputation crystalized on a chaotic Monday in August 2016, when emergency responders saw 28 overdoses over six hours — including two deaths.

The city soon became known as America’s overdose capital. As documentary crews descended, Huntington tried to confront the problem. Among the efforts were quick-response teams charged with finding people days after they were treated for an overdose. The teams include a police officer, a clergy member, a paramedic and a treatment counselor who hand out overdose-reversing naloxone and provide information about treatment. They also direct people to a needle-exchange program run by the Cabell-Huntington Health Department.

One of the key figures in the program is Thommy Hill, a former drug dealer who has become its gatekeeper and central cog. He knows every drug user who visits and constantly tries to persuade them to try treatment — arranging immediate transportation and handing them a backpack full of clothes if they agree.

One morning in late October, bantering with a man who had come in for fresh needles, Hill lit up when the visitor mentioned a past vacation. Hill pitched him a one-week stay at a treatment hospital, joking that “people will wait on you hand and foot.”

A few minutes later, he explained: “It’s all about treating them like people. They don’t get a lot of that.”

Something seems to be working. Non-fatal overdoses in Huntington have fallen and are on track to be 40 percent lower than 2017, city officials said. They are optimistic deaths will be down this year, too.

“If we can turn around overdose numbers here, we can do it anywhere,” Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in May at a health summit in Huntington.

Politicians including President Donald Trump have decried the opioid epidemic, prioritizing it over other health crises. But obesity still presents a towering threat.

West Virginians exercise less than other Americans. They eat fruits and vegetables less often. Only Mississippi has a larger proportion of adults drinking soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages each day.

In some cases, state policies are not helping.

For example, bariatric surgery can help certain obese people for whom conventional diet and exercise programs have no lasting effect. But West Virginia’s Medicaid program has unusually harsh cost-control barriers that make it difficult for severely obese people to get approved for surgery, according to a recent analysis by George Washington University.

Then there’s the soda tax, which health advocates say can give consumers second thoughts about choosing those drinks. Last year, Gov. Jim Justice proposed raising it from 1 cent per 16.9-ounce bottle to a penny per ounce. It failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature.

Signs of change

There are some signs of hope in West Virginia. In October, health advocates held a conference on obesity in the South in West Virginia’s capital city. It was a surprisingly upbeat meeting.

The South has long had the highest obesity rates in the country, and nowhere has adult obesity been more common than in West Virginia. But future-focused projects are popping up all over the state, aimed at getting kids to embrace exercise and healthy eating.

“We want to give people hope that we can be knocked off the unhealthiest list” of states, said Kayla Wright, director of an organization called Try This West Virginia that’s funding many of them.

One grant paid for high school students to build a 5K trail and explore creating a teen cross-country running group. Another grant went toward restoring a greenhouse and helping people learn to garden.

Many of the projects are baby steps, but conference participants cited a few places where progress seems broader. Huntington is one, they say.

Another is Mingo County, in the southwest corner of the state, deep in the heart of coal country. Life expectancy there has never been high. Jobs in the lumber and coal industries were notoriously dangerous. Doctors could be hard to find. And there was violence: The deadly Hatfield-McCoy feud played out in those hills, as did bloody labor battles between miners and coal companies.

The largest municipality in the county, Williamson, became known in the last decade as a center for the abuse of prescription opioid painkillers. (Some called the 3,000-person town “Pilliamson.”)

But while the drug crisis was playing out, some local leaders — led by a young doctor named C. Donovan “Dino” Beckett — built a series of programs aimed at creating a culture of health. It started seven years ago with the opening of a free clinic that later became the Williamson Health and Wellness Center. That spawned a community garden and a vegetable delivery service, a running club and once-a-month 5K races that draw a few hundred runners. Also in the works, for next year, is a federally funded treatment program for people addicted to drugs.

So far, perhaps the most successful program is one that sends health workers to the homes of diabetics.

Jamie Muncy is one success story.

The 48-year-old lost his job three years ago when the mine he was working in shut down. Last fall, he had just pulled out of a long-term habit of pain pills and other drugs when he bizarrely tore a tendon in his foot while picking up a piece of paper at a post office.

It was so painful he rarely walked, but he continued to eat terribly. Out of a job and with his marriage in ruins, “I had no motivation” to be healthy, he said. “I didn’t care.”

By January, the 5-foot-3 former mine foreman ballooned from 165 pounds to 196. “I was round as I was tall,” he said.

A visit to the Williamson health center revealed he had alarming, diabetes-qualifying blood sugar levels. He’d had mini-strokes in the past, and his physician said a much bigger one was probably on its way if Muncy did not take drastic steps.

The doctor put him on a tight carb-cutting diet, connected him to physical therapy and put him in the home-visit diabetes program.

Now Muncy walks 5 miles a day and is a regular at the farmer’s market. His weight is down to about 145 pounds, he said in a recent interview. He still smokes, though.

An uncertain future

University of Washington researchers recently calculated something called “healthy life expectancy” — the period someone born today could expect to live in relative health. West Virginia, at 62½ years, was the lowest among states.

Clearly, health problems abound.

Black lung disease rates and coal mine injury rates appear to be up.

West Virginia has been at the top of the charts in hepatitis B and C infection rates. Adding to that, the state saw an HIV outbreak last year, and it is still weathering a hepatitis A outbreak — both associated with injection drug users

Maggie Hill, the lifelong West Virginian, has little hope for the future. But she does have Charity.

Charity is a 10-year-old girl Hill adopted about five years ago. Hill’s son had been raising her but lost custody during his ongoing struggle with drug addiction, Hill said.

Hill and Charity live in a small wooded valley with a creek in it — a holler, as they say in West Virginia. Her house is a cabin that from the outside resembles a small, tidy barn. Charity has given her life a purpose, she said.

“I taught her how to survive when I’m gone,” she said. “I have to. She’s going to need to know how to cook. … She needs to know how to keep house. She needs to know how to mow grass, so if she ain’t got a man, she can keep the yard clean. I teach her every bit of this.”

Charity is a good student (“Four A’s and a B on her last report card,” Hill said). And there’s hope that she will do well enough to go to college. Hill is saving for it. “She wants to be a doctor,” Hill said.

If Charity does go to college, some place away from Boone County, Hill says she will move there with her. “If I’m alive,” she said.

The Denver Post,Denver’s “Red Ball” brings awareness to World AIDS Day with hair and runway show,"A Rachel Marie Hurst model poses backstage at Red Ball. (Francie Swidler, The Denver Post)

Not everyone in Denver was at Sports Authority Field at Mile High Sunday night.

November 29 was also the evening of Denver’s seventh annual Red Ball, a night of big fashion and big hair produced by the Colorado AIDS Project, aimed at fundraising and bringing awareness to World AIDS Day (Dec. 1).

Each year in August, dozens of Denver-based clothing designers and hair salons apply to be part of Red Ball.

A little less than half of the applications make the cut.

After being selected, salons and designers are matched together into “teams” and get to work, collaborating on often over-the-top clothing and hair creations with only a few months to spare.

Many of the designers put their day jobs on hold to create special, elaborate collections specifically for the event, rather than selecting ready-to-wear pieces that may already be hanging in their studios.

It’s no surprise that the event is such a dear and beloved one among Denver’s creative community — it supports an organization close to the hearts of many.

The Colorado AIDS Project helps hundreds in the metro area through health education services, financial and housing assistance, substance abuse counseling and more. The goal is to help the community live healthier by educating those at risk of HIV, and working with them to choose safer behaviors.

It can be easy however for that sentiment to take a backseat to all the extravagant hair and costume-style fashion that often takes over the night.

On Sunday though, one designer-stylist team made sure that message was heard loud and clear.

“This year we are about the power of words,” Anne Fanganello, the designer of Anna Festa told me backstage. “What words can do and how they can affect you.”

“We have something happening that nobody knows about. We re doing a protest – we re literally doing a protest on the runway. Are we here because of the beautiful clothes and beautiful hair? Yes….but really, it’s about the message. ‘Get tested,’ ‘Stop aids,’ ‘Support the people out there.’

Anna Festa was assigned to work with Belle and Beau Salon — and while the pairing was random — they both shared the same vision.

“For me, its bigger than a hair show and a fashion show,” said Josh Coyne of Belle and Beau.

Coyne cuts hair pro-bono at the Colorado AIDS Project the first Tuesday of every month.

“More people need to know why [Colorado AIDS Project is] here, who they re helping, why they re helping, and how much they really do for people.”

Yes, the fashion on the runway was big, and the hair was even bigger. But it was “protest” created by Anna Festa and Belle and Beau Salon that had the biggest impact of the night.

“We re going to make a huge statement,” Coyne said.

They did.

“We re not focusing on the hair or the designs. We re focused on the messages on those boards.”

The Denver Post,FBI: Aurora child sex trafficking case is “extremely unusual”,"AURORA — The FBI says the case of a 48-year-old man accused of sex trafficking boys through a rented Aurora home is extremely rare as new information surfaced Tuesday showing the suspect is linked to an elusive California business.

“As far as this kind of thing, where he is luring kids from California and using online dating websites, it’s like ‘Holy crap,’ ” said Anne Darr, the FBI Denver division’s victim specialist who worked on the case. “We’ve never seen this before.”

Darr said the FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force in Denver, which investigated the case and is made up of federal agents and local police, rarely sees male victims. When they do, she said, they are on a street-level basis.

“It’s extremely unusual and unique,” Darr said of Sean Crumpler’s case.

At the expansive beige house where authorities say Crumpler — a California sex offender — perpetuated his exploitation, the blinds were pulled shut Wednesday and the driveway stood empty. Knocks on the front door of the East Hinsdale Place home in Aurora’s southeastern corner went unanswered.

“I just feel sorry for the boys,” said Susan Smith, a neighbor, as she teared up. “It’s just sad that someone would take advantage of boys in that situation.”

Crumpler faces 12 counts, including charges of child sex trafficking and child sex assault. He allegedly told one of his teen victims, according to an arrest affidavit, that he finds “young boys to bring back to the house” and that he calls his efforts “hunting.”

Two 16-year-old boys were living at the Aurora home, according to the affidavit, along with about a dozen men between 18 and 21. New arrivals would “earn” housing and food through “sex,” the document said.

A 21-year-old man who lived at the home told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” The man also said Crumpler was HIV-positive and had unprotected sex with those living in the house.

The Denver Post found Crumpler is the owner of a Long Beach, Calif., information technology firm that claims to specialize in helping primary care physicians operate their practices, according to his LinkedIn account and an employee.

His company, Centernix, is listed out of an apparent virtual office space and was registered in California in 2007. A contractor who answered Centernix’s phone Tuesday morning said he was unaware of Crumpler’s arrest.

Authorities declined to comment Tuesday on the case and said their investigation into Crumpler is still active and ongoing.

Court records show Crumpler has been released after posting $100,000 bail. Arapahoe County prosecutors say he is due in court Monday.

“We look forward to defending the charges in court,” Crumpler’s attorney, Brian Musell, told The Denver Post on Tuesday.

He declined to comment further.

The Denver Post,Colorado House panel OKs bill requiring criminal checks for surgical techs,"The health scare caused by the recent drug-theft indictment of a surgical tech has prompted a push to require Colorado to conduct criminal background checks on those seeking to become surgical technologists and surgical assistants.

Key legislators also want any pre-employment tests conducted by hospitals that detect drug use in those fields of work to be reported to state regulators.

House Bill 1160, which has the support of key Democrats, passed out of the House Health, Environment and Insurance Committee on Tuesday. The bill has been amended to require the state to conduct criminal background checks on all surgical technologists and surgical assistants that seek registration with the state or have had their registration lapse.

“We’re hopeful it will pass in the House, but it likely will face more opposition in the Senate,” said Diana Protopapa, a lobbyist working on behalf of professional associations for surgical technologists and surgical assistants.

Democrats supporting the legislation point to the criminal cases of Rocky Allen and Kristen Parker as highlighting the need for more state oversight.

Allen is accused by federal prosecutors of swapping out a needle filled with fentanyl while working as a surgical technologist for Swedish Medical Center in Englewood.

Prior to his hiring by Swedish, Allen had been fired by four other hospitals. He also had been court-martialed in 2011 for fentanyl theft while deployed to Afghanistan with the Navy.

Swedish, which fired Allen for the alleged drug theft, has warned thousands of patients who had surgery there that Allen may have exposed them to HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Court testimony revealed he is carrying a bloodborne pathogen.

Parker infected dozens of people in 2009 with hepatitis C when she injected herself with needles filled with liquid painkillers while working as a surgical tech at Rose Medical Center in Denver.

“I don’t want some drug-addicted, wacky person in that room with me (if undergoing surgery),” said Lois Landgraf, R-Fountain. “I’d rather err on the side of too much than not enough.”

Some Republicans say they fear the legislation is overkill and would like to see the current law expire. It requires surgical technologists and assistants to register with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies.

Rep. Steve Humphrey, R-Severance, said he viewed the registration requirement as duplicative of the pre-employment screening process that hospitals in the state say they already do.

“I consider it to be blacklisting,” he said.

Colorado began requiring the registration of such health care workers in 2010 after Parker’s conviction on drug-theft charges. Colorado is one of only a handful of states that regulate surgical techs or surgical assistants at all. The law requiring such registration in Colorado is set to expire this year.

Prior to Allen’s federal indictment, the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies had urged “sunsetting” the registration requirement for surgical techs and assistants in the state.

Officials with DORA on Tuesday told legislators they were neutral on the measure.

The Denver Post,"Global drug policy can’t evolve unless U.N. changes mind-set, group warns","UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations has a golden opportunity to promote alternate approaches to global drug policy next month when it meets in New York for a special session, but a high-profile commission said Friday that the work leading up to the meeting has so far been disappointing.

The Global Commission on Drug Policy — whose members include former presidents of Mexico and Brazil, as well as former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson — said in a statement that ongoing discussions in Vienna drafting the session s outcome document rely too heavily on an outdated law-and-order approach that emphasizes criminal justice and prohibition.

Ilona Szabo de Carvalho, coordinator for the Global Commission on Drug Policy, said the emphasis should be on alternative approaches to fighting the problem, including decriminalization, abolishing capital punishment for drug-related offenses and a focus on treatment.

Instead, she said, the preparation talks are relying too heavily on traditional methods of fighting drug trafficking and related crimes.

De Carvalho called for a broad political debate on alternative measures at the U.N. General Assembly Special Session on April 19.

U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime Executive Director Yury Fedotov said in prepared remarks to be delivered Monday that preparation for the special session has included new approaches including a call for treatment and services for drug-related cases of HIV, hepatitis and overdose.

Moreover, it has helped to put the spotlight on considering, in appropriate drug-related cases of a minor nature, including possession for personal consumption, alternatives to conviction or punishment, using such measures as education, aftercare, rehabilitation and social reintegration, he says.

De Carvalho said there have been some amazing advances, since the last special session on drugs 18 years ago.

The Global Commission on Drug Policy pointed to new approaches in dealing with drug issues in countries including Portugal, which decriminalized the use of all drugs in 2001 resulting in significant crime prevention and a decrease in rates of HIV.

Uruguay has regulated its cannabis market from production to distribution to sales while emphasizing human rights in its strategy, it said.

The commission cited the U.S. as well, noting that 23 states plus the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes and there is now a vigorous debate about how to transform drug policies to reduce the number of people incarcerated in jails and prisons on minor drug offenses.

Such policies, the commission argues, disempower organized crime entities that supply drugs and put governments back in control of the problem.

Drugs are dangerous, but current narcotics policies are an even bigger threat, said Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, in a statement. This is because punishment is given a greater priority than health and human rights. Prohibition has had virtually no impact on the supply of or demand for illicit drugs.",11/03/2016

These programs, for example:

— Work one-on-one to mentor students who need assistance in reading and math;

— Provide dental care to kids who have never had a checkup and adults who are HIV positive;

— Offer shelter and basic medical service to homeless teens;

— Help guide people across the state to food banks and other programs that can put meals on their table.

When you make a donation to Season to Share, your contribution is matched at 50 percent by our partners at the McCormick Foundation. And 100 percent of your gift — in addition to the match — goes directly to local nonprofits such as the ones profiled in this section. None of the funds are used for administrative costs because The Denver Post and the McCormick Foundation cover those costs.

Last year, 53 local groups received funding from the $2.35 million raised by Season to Share, and with your help, we can continue this important mission.

Please join us in making a difference this holiday season.

Sincerely,

Gregory L. Moore

The Denver Post,Guest Commentary: LGBT equity? Not so fast.,"On June 26, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality on a 5-4 vote. While the celebrations continue, we also need to remember that “equal dignity in the eyes of the law” does not always translate into equality in action. Health care for LGBT people is still not equal.

Lesbian women (and other women who have sex with women) have a much higher risk for getting breast cancer than other women. Gay men (and other men who have sex with men) have a higher risk for syphilis, gonorrhea, HIV, chlamydia, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. LGBT individuals who are not “out” are more likely to suffer depression and bullying. Transgender individuals have a 500 percent relative risk of being a victim of violence.

These health disparities are the consequences of inequity, mistrust, and prejudice. They result from being denied health insurance based on who they love and who they identify as; they come from hiding important information from their health care providers, like sexual behaviors and mental health, out of the fear of rejection or outing. It also comes from healthcare providers who have not been educated on LGBT health issues.

Insurance companies are no longer allowed to discriminate against people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or health conditions (including HIV status). This prevents insurance companies from denying people coverage based on “pre-existing conditions,” including transgender status, and insurance companies can’t drop your coverage if you get sick. Hospitals must allow patients to have anyone they want come and visit them, and they must apply rules equally to everyone, i.e. both opposite-sex and same-sex partners.

And since the Supreme Court ruling, same-sex spouses are covered under spousal insurance, no matter where they were married, if that employer offers spousal insurance to other (opposite-sex) employees.

All patients should know their rights to equitable high-quality healthcare, including free preventive care..

All hospitals, clinics, and providers should be savvy in health care rights, should be caring of all patients, should actively take initiative to make your experience as inclusive as possible. Unfortunately, that does not always happen. Patients have the right and the power to demand respect and equality.

LGBT patients should read our ” Know Your Rights” page to learn about health care rights, how to access LGBT-friendly providers and more detailed resources, and how to file a complaint. It is only when patient speak up for their rights that the systems will start moving the law into action.

The Denver Post,Renew the U.S. commitment to sex education,"It is difficult to fathom today the political firestorm that erupted more than 20 years ago when one of us called for sex education for the nation’s youth, or the firestorm 14 years ago, when another of us released “The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior.” Since then, the United States has made significant strides. The birth rate among teenagers has declined more than 50 percent since 1991, and the rate of new HIV infections has finally leveled off.

Despite these gains, the United States continues to have one of the highest teen birth rates and some of the highest rates of sexually transmitted disease in the industrialized world. Every hour in this country, 70 teenagers become pregnant, 1,100 youth acquire an STD and one young person contracts HIV. The newspapers are full of accounts of sexual assaults on college campuses, and violence and harassment continue to plague many of our gay and gender-nonconforming youth.

Perhaps most distressing is that our national response continues to misunderstand the challenge. In fact, just last month Congress increased to $75 million a year funding for programs that promote sexual abstinence until marriage. The United States has spent billions of dollars on these “just say no” programs even though a federally funded evaluation shows that they have no impact on delaying sexual initiation or reducing the risk for unintended pregnancy, HIV or other STDs. Never mind that, by law, these programs must withhold lifesaving information about the health benefits of condoms and contraception.

Thirty years of public health research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education is effective. It can provide young people with the information and skills they need to reduce their risk for unplanned pregnancy and STDs. When done well, sex education can also help young people traverse puberty, understand the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships, develop positive body image, communicate effectively, make informed decisions and navigate the health-care system. In short, quality sex education can go beyond the promotion of abstinence or even the prevention of unplanned pregnancy and disease to provide a lifelong foundation for sexual health.

Fourteen years ago, we called for a thoughtful discussion about sexuality, for the recognition that sexuality encompasses more than sexual behavior and is a fundamental part of human life. We were largely ignored.

We called for providing education about sexual health and responsible sexual behavior that is thorough, wide-ranging and begins early. It did not happen.

We called for the recognition that parents are a child’s first educators and should help guide other sex-education efforts so that they are consistent with a family’s values and beliefs. Because families differ in their level of knowledge, as well as their emotional capability to discuss sexuality issues, we also called for equal access to information for promoting sexual health and responsible sexual behavior and the recognition that sex education is a vital component of a school’s responsibility. Still we wait.

Few would disagree that parents should be the primary sexuality educators of their children. It does seem clear, however, that providing age-appropriate sex education in schools is useful and important to ensure that the youth of this nation have a basic understanding of sexuality and can be prepared to take personal responsibility for their sexual health.

Fourteen years after our call to action, we call once again for a renewed commitment to the sexual education of our youth. We call for age-appropriate, medically accurate, evidence-informed and comprehensive school-based sexual health education for young people. Ignorance is nobody’s ally, and education remains this nation’s most powerful tool.

The Denver Post,Swedish Medical Center infection scare didn’t have to happen,"In the spring of 2009, I heard the words, “You have hepatitis C.” This diagnosis changed my life completely.

I am one of the 19 patients who was infected with hepatitis C at Rose Medical Center in 2009. Later, it was revealed that a surgical tech had been diverting drugs for over six months, injecting herself, refilling the syringes with saline and placing them back onto surgical trays. Nearly 6,000 patients were put in harm’s way.

This week, it was reported that Swedish Medical Center is asking about 2,900 patients to get tested for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C after discovering that a former employee may have stolen narcotic pain medicines. The news strikes an eerily similar tone.

My heart breaks for the patients who sit and wait and worry while results from blood tests come back. But the truth of the matter is this could have been prevented. It did not need to happen.

Swedish is a member of HCA Healthcare, the largest health care operator in the world, and sister to Rose Medical Center, where the outbreak occurred seven years ago. You would think they would have a better system in place to prevent diversion. You would think they may have learned from the past mistakes at Rose. Still, this happened again.

Shortly after the news broke of the outbreak in 2009, as I wrestled with severe health issues and struggled with fear of what might happen to me as the mother of a 1-year-old daughter, I realized that worrying was not enough. I had to jump into action and help prevent this from ever happening again.

For the last six years, I have been telling my story, sharing educational materials and reinforcing best practices, and making health care professionals and patients aware of the potential risks of unsafe injections and possible drug diversion.

Along with my colleagues at HONOReform, I have joined the National Drug Diversion Committee to discuss the need to develop a formal program to prevent, detect and respond to these risks on a national level.

Ironically, legislation that I lobbied for in the 2010 Colorado legislature, House Bill 1415, is up for review.

The national Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations has certain competency requirements for medical staff, but they do not go far enough. And the state of Colorado does not mandate background checks for new employees. The Colorado law is important and necessary.

Also, in my research and travels, I discovered that many hospitals don’t even do a pre-employment drug screen. If health care facilities can be this lax in employment screening and protocols, where are the other gaps?

While we know drug diversion happens, the data is unreliable about the frequency. Some incidents are never discovered. And some incidents of drug diversion never get reported outside a hospital system. But the threat is real. Hospital staff and patients remain at risk.

To reinforce the need for sustained attention to the issue, I partnered with the One and Only Campaign in Colorado to help raise awareness among patients and health care providers about safe injection practices. I am also working with the International Health Facilities Diversion Association, an organization that is devoted to protecting patients, staff and facilities from the harm associated with drug diversion by health care personnel.

My hope is to support those who are going through this very difficult time and allow the conversation to begin about tighter safety protocols and fixing broken health care systems. There is help out there for those who need it. I know because I was once in your shoes.

And for health care facilities, there are examples of very efficient and effective safety standards that have been tried and tested and succeed in the common goal of keeping everyone safe.

The Denver Post,Aurora child sex trafficking suspect due in court Monday,"CENTENNIAL — A 48-year-old man charged with operating a child sex trafficking operation out of an upscale Aurora home is due in court Monday morning for an appearance on bond.

Sean Travis Crumpler faces 12 counts, including charges of child sex trafficking and child sex assault, in the case. He allegedly told one of his teen victims, according to an arrest affidavit, that he finds “young boys to bring back to the house” and that he calls his efforts “hunting.”

Crumpler is free after posting a $100,000 bond.

The Denver Post found Crumpler owns an elusive Los Angeles-area information technology firm that claims to specialize in helping primary care physicians operate their practices, according to his LinkedIn account and an employee.

His company, Centernix, is listed out of an apparent virtual office space and was registered in California in 2007. A contractor who answered Centernix’s phone last week said he was unaware of Crumpler’s arrest.

A member of FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force in Denver, which investigated the case, said Crumpler’s arrest and his alleged crimes are ” extremely unusual.”

Two 16-year-old boys were living at Crumpler’s Aurora home along with about a dozen men between 18 and 21, according to the affidavit.

New arrivals would “earn” housing and food through “sex,” the document said.

A 21-year-old man who lived at the home told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” The man also said Crumpler was HIV-positive and had unprotected sex with those living in the house.

Crumpler is a registered sex offender.

The Denver Post,Utah panel endorses expanding use of marijuana extract oil,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A proposal to allow Utah residents to use oil extracted from marijuana to treat more diseases, including cancer and HIV, received an early vote of support Wednesday from some state lawmakers.

The measure also would allow the oil to be produced and distributed in Utah. The state currently lets only those with severe epilepsy who meet certain conditions have the oil, and only if they get it from other states such as neighboring Colorado.

Supporters say 2,000 to 5,000 people would be issued cards under the new program from Rep. Brad Daw of Orem and Sen. Evan Vickers of Cedar City, both Republicans. The Health and Human Services Interim Committee voted 10-5 to support it.

The panel did not vote on proposal for a much broader medical marijuana program that lawmakers have been weighing since earlier this year.

The extract called cannabidiol is low in THC, the hallucinogenic chemical in marijuana, and high in CBD, a chemical that some believe helps fight seizures.

Doctors who recommend their patients use the oil would need to report side effects to the health department, and no doctor would be able to have more than 100 patients on the oil. The program also would cover those with AIDS and certain chronic pain conditions.

Wednesday’s vote does not advance the bill but is a stamp of approval that could boost support for the measure when the full Legislature meets in January to begin regular hearings and debate.

The other proposal, from Saratoga Springs Republican Sen. Mark Madsen, would allow those with certain chronic or debilitating conditions to consume edible marijuana products such as brownies and candies that contain higher levels of THC. It would ban smoking pot.

He has discussed the idea with the committee several times since summer, but a draft of the proposal wasn’t ready for a vote. Madsen has said his plan likely would cover more ailments, estimating that about 100,000 people could be issued medical marijuana cards.

He made a similar proposal earlier this year, but it failed when lawmakers said they worried about whether it would serve as a smoke screen for expanded recreational use.

Madsen has cited his own marijuana use to treat chronic back pain in his effort to convince colleagues. He is not running for re-election next year, making the 2016 session his final chance to the advance the proposal.

He has said that if Utah doesn’t pass a marijuana program, he would move to one of the 23 other states that permit medical pot after his term ends.

“I believe the people of Utah are at least as smart as the people of 23 other states that have medical cannabis,” Madsen said Wednesday.

The Denver Post,Clinton Foundation would weigh down a Hillary presidency,"The Clintons have been targeted by trumped-up scandals from Whitewater to Benghazi. There also are self-inflicted wounds: President Bill Clinton’s dalliance with Monica Lewinsky and Hillary Clinton’s use of private e-mail servers while secretary of state.

They may be on the verge of creating another one: The Clinton Foundation, which has done extraordinary good works over the past 15 years, would present an inherent conflict of interest should she become president, and may be problematic for her even now as a candidate.

Clinton has suggested that if she is elected, the foundation — which collects contributions from wealthy interests including foreign governments — would continue basically as is. “The work that it’s done has been extraordinary,” she said in March when asked whether there would be any ethical concerns about continuing the foundation. “The answer is transparency.”

Ethics experts reject that. They say there wouldn’t be any way to avoid the appearance of conflicts if she wins the presidency.

“If Bill seeks to raise large sums of money from donors who also have an interest in U.S. policy, the public will rightly question whether the grants affected United States foreign policy,” says Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University School of Law. Ethics rules, he notes, are “not merely to prevent bad behavior but to foster public trust in the integrity of government choices.” He’s open, however, to the idea of the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea, running the foundation.

But others say any connection is unacceptable. Joel Fleishman, a foundation expert, says the Clintons have to “sever the relationship completely and put it in the hands of independent trustees.” They have to pick a leader of “impeccable integrity and let it go its own way in raising money,” says Fleishman, who ran a foundation and has written a book on philanthropy.

The Clinton Foundation and its various offshoots have raised about $2 billion from wealthy individuals, corporations — especially Wall Street — and foreign governments. Much of its work is widely praised.

A major initiative provides care to poor people in developing countries, chiefly in Africa, to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria. It has negotiated with pharmaceutical companies for reduced prices for drugs and diagnostic equipment. It also has programs on clean water, food security and climate change. These efforts have encouraged citizen and volunteer involvement.

This has not been without controversy. Some of the donors have been influence-seekers, including a Canadian businessman who, according to critics, who may have sought to parlay his Clinton connections to reap business benefits with dictators. The foundation also set up a Canadian subsidiary that effectively skirted some disclosure requirements.

An article in The Wall Street Journal this month raised questions about a financial commitment that the Clinton Foundation made to a for-profit company run by politically connected close friends.

Some of these issues surfaced during Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state. It’s a bigger problem now that she’s the leading presidential candidate, and it would be critical if she gets to the White House. The corrective would appear to be to follow Fleishman’s advice, separate totally from the foundation and select an unimpeachable leader. The current president, Donna Shalala, a respected former cabinet member and university president, has not said whether she will stay on beyond the end of this year. Chelsea Clinton would not fit the bill for the post.

To be sure, Donald Trump would face huge conflicts of his own, particularly regarding his connection to his business empire, but also when it comes to issues involving the U.S. government, such as, for example, a dispute over a Trump golf course overseas or trademark regulations.

President Obama, his critics notwithstanding, has run a remarkably scandal-free administration; there have been very few ethical lapses.

That’s a record that Hillary Clinton, or any next president, should try to emulate. That means separating from the Clinton Foundation.

The Denver Post,Debate over ‘Hamilton’ speech exposes post-election cracks,"NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump demanded an apology from the cast of the Broadway musical “Hamilton” a day after an actor in the hit show delivered a pointed message about diversity to his running mate who was in attendance. The speech aimed at Mike Pence prompted angry responses from liberals and conservatives alike — underscoring yet again the fractious aftermath of the 2016 election.

The bitter back-and-forth came after the vice president-elect caught Friday night’s performance of “Hamilton” with his nephew and daughter. A mixture of boos and cheers could be heard inside the theater as Pence took his seat. When the show ended, Pence was asked by a cast member to hear a prepared speech after the curtain call from the multiracial and multicultural cast, saying it is concerned about the Trump administration.

“We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” said Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, the nation’s third vice president, as his fellow actors joined hands. “We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.”

The unusual address quickly went viral and Trump on Saturday tweeted that it was “very rude,” arguing that Pence was “harassed” and theater “must always be a safe and special place.” He urged the cast to apologize. Dixon responded on Twitter that “conversation is not harassment sir” and added that he appreciated Pence stopping to listen.

Pence had ducked out before Dixon finished the unprecedented message but heard the full remarks from the hallway outside the auditorium.

Trump transition officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for the show said none of the cast members would be available to speak Saturday.

Melissa Kremholz, of Indianapolis, the capital of Pence’s home state of Indiana, attended the show Friday night and was seeing it again Saturday afternoon. She said she could see how Dixon’s speech might be interpreted as impolite and gave Pence credit for coming, but backed the Broadway cast’s right to explain how uneasy many Americans feel.

“I think it was really important for them to speak what they had to say because the whole musical talks about how our country came to be and our American values and how our country was built on immigrants and people of all different backgrounds,” she said. “I think it’s really important that they actually spoke their minds and I think they did so very respectfully, too.”

The show’s official Facebook page was inundated with comments ranging from calling Dixon’s speech “disrespectful,” ”inappropriate” and “uncalled for.” Many threatened to not buy tickets to future performances. Tickets for the show are not available for another year; “Hamilton” is sold out through September 2017.

The American Civil Liberties Union weighed in on the side of the Broadway cast, saying the First Amendment is a cornerstone of America “even if it sometimes makes our leaders uncomfortable.”

“President-elect Trump needs a refresher on his high school civics class. Americans don’t apologize — not even to presidents or vice presidents — for the lawful and proper exercise of their constitutional rights,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero wrote in a statement.

But Noel Leifer, from Manchester, New Jersey, who was in line to see a matinee Saturday with his wife, Peggy, said he understood why so many people felt that actors lecturing the next vice president from a Broadway stage were somewhat impudent.

“It was a protest. It was a bit disrespectful. They are going to be the leaders of the country. I didn’t vote for them — I think they’re poor candidates — but they’re still going to be leaders,” said Leifer, who was celebrating his wife’s birthday with tickets he bought a year ago.

As for a boycott of the show, he didn’t think that would ultimately fly. “I don’t think too many people who have spent the money for this show are going to boycott it just to make a protest statement.”

The musical is by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the story, music and lyrics. It stresses the orphan, immigrant roots of first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and has a terrifically varied score, ranging from pop ballads to gospel to sexy R&B. It has been cheered for reclaiming the nation’s founding story with a multicultural cast.

Miranda, in a tweet, said he was “proud” of Dixon and the “Hamilton” cast “for leading with love,” before reminding people that everyone is welcome at the theater.

Miranda had been a big booster for the failed presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, including performing at an all-star fundraiser for her last month. The cast also put on a special “Hamilton” show at a Clinton fundraiser last summer.

The person playing Alexander Hamilton that Pence saw was Javier Munoz, an openly gay actor. Pence supported numerous efforts to ban gay marriage as governor of Indiana and opposed unfettered federal funding for HIV and AIDS treatment.

Many in the Broadway community quickly defended the actions of the “Hamilton” cast, including new Tony Award-winner Cynthia Erivo, who mocked: “You want the theater full of people you have alienated to be protective of you?” And Josh Gad, a Tony nominee for “The Book of Mormon,” wrote: “I know the booing upsets some of you. But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.”

Janise Gray, of Union, New Jersey, who saw the show Saturday afternoon, considered the speech an anguished cry from those fearful they will be pushed aside under Republican rule.

“One way or another, we want everybody to be represented and the way the campaign was, it wasn’t feeling that everybody was being represented,” she said, adding that she was glad Pence came.

“From what I’ve heard, it sounded like it was fair and equitable. It was just a statement of ‘please represent everyone. We are a diverse country and we need to be inclusive,'” she said. “That’s what this country was founded on.”

The Denver Post,Football nearly killed him. Then it helped save his life.,"The floor fell out of John Flora’s world when his foot nearly snapped in half running a simple cone drill. But the worst was still to come, when he was covered in vomit and wondering how it all went wrong.

“The lowest point of my life,” Flora said. “Then it all slowly started coming together.”

As football bridges from the college bowl season to the NFL draft this spring, the names of hundreds of young players will surface as potential stars. Only a few will find that glory. Some will fall just shy of an NFL roster. Nearly all of them will suffer in some way. How they make it through those transitions out of college will largely fall on finding a place to belong.

Flora was a standout high school linebacker in Denver’s suburbs and a large-and-in-charge defensive lineman at Wyoming before he arrived at the threshold of the NFL. He always carried an overflowing passion for football that almost seemed sentimental. But he had the physical gifts for a real shot at the professional ranks.

Then his dream ended in a snap. In front of NFL scouts, at a pro-day tryout in 2006 that he hoped would prove his next-level ability, Flora suffered a broken foot running a noncontact “L drill” pivoting around orange cones.

“And that’s when hell happened,” said Flora, now 34.

Football is America’s most unforgiving major sport, a game cluttered with the discarded bodies of once-promising young players who break down physically. Most football careers never come to a convenient end, but the players forced to leave because of injuries are especially vulnerable, torn away from a game they love on a timetable they never envisioned.

What Flora finally figured out, through three years of misery, changed his life. Football never left him. It beat him down and twisted his emotions. But he didn’t need to withdraw from the game. The problem was his.

Football nearly killed him — but it also helped saved his life.

“Swept under the carpet”

Flora’s sacrifices took him to the fringe of the NFL. He was trying to be one of the few dozen players every year who sign as undrafted rookies. The Indianapolis Colts flew scouts to Laramie for a private workout with him and three other Wyoming players.

“I felt good that day,” Flora recalled. “I was thinking, ‘This is the next level for me.’ ”

But he never made it to the end of practice. In shorts and tennis shoes, trying to post an impressive time in front of judgmental men with clipboards and stopwatches, he cut around a cone on the War Memorial Stadium turf and snapped his left foot.

“It just popped,” Flora said. His day — his career — was over. Word spread through NFL scouting departments. Cross off “DE FLORA” from the list.

“I got swept under the carpet,” he said. “I went from hearing from a bunch of teams to nothing. It was like, ‘Where’d everyone go?’ That feeling is gut-wrenching.”

The three other Wyoming players at that NFL tryout soon signed contracts: quarterback Corey Bramlet with the New England Patriots, wide receiver Jovon Bouknight with the Carolina Panthers and safety Derrick Martin with the Baltimore Ravens, who played eight seasons in the NFL.

Flora instead headed to a hospital. Surgeons jammed screws into his foot to hold it together. They prescribed him heavy doses of pain medication. His recovery turned into a long struggle, with nothing waiting for him at the end.

“You spend years and years training and all I wanted was an opportunity. And then — done,” he said.

Only about 3 percent of Colorado high school football players are recruited by Division I college programs, let alone ever play for one. Flora was one of them, and he always played through pain.

He suffered a concussion as a sophomore in high school. He suffered a torn ligament in his right knee as a senior. Another concussion playing basketball. He redshirted as a freshman at Wyoming because of a lingering stress fracture, and he suffered a concussion before his sophomore year. But he played every game over his final three seasons with the Cowboys.

“I would downplay it with doctors,” he said of a string of nagging injuries. “I’d say, ‘Oh, I just tweaked something.’ I never wanted to miss anything. I had a dream of going to the next level.”

By 2004, Flora was an oversized defensive end dominating the Las Vegas Bowl in Wyoming’s upset win over UCLA. At 6-foot-4 and 267 pounds, he helped shut down Bruins running back Maurice Jones-Drew.

Flora was gathering affirmation of his NFL dream. After that standout junior year, he had been named to the all-Mountain West preseason first team. On Wyoming’s depth chart as a senior, he started in front of Mitch Unrein, who went on to play five seasons with the Broncos.

Then, nothing.

“When I realized football was gone,” Flora said, “I just cried. And the only thing that helped was pain pills.”

Trying to not feel the pain

After football was ripped from Flora, heartache consumed him. His purpose vanished — until he discovered a new dedication. “It caught fire,” he said. “My addiction.”

He coasted to a business degree in 2006 but never used it. He was too high on pain medication. He was taking two, three, then four pills at a pop to start. Then 12 in a night. Opiates at first, then benzodiazepines and sleeping pills. Vicodin, Xanax, Ativan.

“I did everything I could to not feel anything,” Flora said.

His addiction wasn’t unique. The New York Times recently described the ongoing opioid epidemic as “the deadliest drug crisis in American history,” with overdoses accounting for 64,000 deaths in 2016, the majority from opiates. Painkillers led to nearly 100 deaths every day last year, “a pace faster than the HIV epidemic at its peak.”

Pain pills are also, specifically, a football problem. A study conducted by Washington University in St. Louis found that NFL players abused opioid medications four times as often as the rest of the U.S. population.

Nothing about Flora seemed to predispose him to addiction — except, perhaps, the one thing that binds successful football players: the requirement to commit in full. All that effort he had put into making himself a college standout and pro prospect he turned toward finding pills.

“His light just switched off,” said Flora’s mother, Pam. “His love of the game disappeared. It was horrible. He saw the end, and that was it. Everything was done, his future was gone. And that’s when the addiction started.”

Flora conned pills from websites in Ecuador. He had dealers in Laramie and Denver. He stole pills from his mother after she underwent double knee surgery. He stole expired pain pills from his grandmother and his aunt. After his girlfriend’s roommate’s dog needed surgery, he stole the pet pills.

“That’s how disgusting my mind was,” he said. “It’s embarrassing. It’s humiliating. But it’s the truth.”

Planning to take his life

Long after the pain of a broken foot faded, Flora’s mental torment continued to compound. In the throes of a three-year addiction spiral, he plotted how to kill himself, slowly, with pain pills.

“I had it in my mind, this is how I wanted to die,” he said. “I didn’t want to feel that pain anymore.”

He would spend hours sitting on the floor of a shower with water running over his head, alone and pulsing with shame. “I couldn’t even shave in front of a mirror because I was so disgusted with myself,” he said.

Flora’s parents grew tired of his manipulation and lying. They sent him to a rehabilitation center near Del Ray Beach, just north of Boca Raton, Fla. But his drug haze was so thick, Flora can’t remember how he got there.

Rehab didn’t work, and he lied his way out. Scoring pain pills was easy, and rehab proved to be a great place to meet like-minded drug seekers. One morning, Flora woke up on the beach near a guy who had fallen asleep with a heroin needle in his arm.

Flora’s parents figured out how he was dodging rehab and gave him an ultimatum: Get through detox, do the steps, get a job. If not, they told him, they would call the police and he no longer would be their son.

“As hard as it was on my parents,” Flora said, “if they didn’t let me go, I would have been gone. Because I would have died.”

So he committed, finally in 2008, to detoxing. It took three weeks to withdraw from pain pills. “That was rock bottom, pure hell,” he said. He often woke up covered in his own vomit.

“It was a very dark time for us,” Pam said. “He’s strong, not just physically but mentally. When he puts his mind to something, good or bad, he gets there. We said a lot of prayers. We had to save his life.”

Finding a new purpose

Flora eased back into life with a job at a four-star hotel in 2008. He earned the employee of the year award. But something was missing. He needed football.

The nearest team he could find was Florida Atlantic University, an upstart program coming off its first bowl-game victory in 2007. The Owls were at the time coached by Howard Schnellenberger, the former coach of the Baltimore Colts who won a national championship at the University of Miami.

Flora walked into Schnellenberger’s office overlooking FAU’s practice field, unspooled an honest story of addiction and recovery, and asked for a job, any job.

“When you find a kid who’s having trouble, it’s our responsibility to try to help them work through it,” Schnellenberger said. “As a coach, you have to be a chaplain, a doctor, a coach, everything. You have to help get them through an injury, a drug addiction; maybe they were locked up for something. You have to try to keep them in the loop.”

Flora got an unpaid position doing grunt work helping coach the Owls’ offense through spring practices. There was nothing glamorous about the job. But it was football, a glint of the game that once left him behind.

Then he received a phone call from Brad Pyatt, a former All-Colorado wide receiver two years ahead of Flora at Arvada West who played in the NFL for the Colts. Pyatt had been hired as A-West’s new coach and was putting the band back together. He asked Flora to be his defensive line coach.

“I don’t ever ask my kids ‘Who’s your favorite coach?’ But I can tell you John is one of them,” Pyatt said. “They have nothing but high praise and loyalty for John.”

Flora now starts his job at 3 a.m. working with his brother at the family’s pet food distribution company, then in the fall leaves in time to coach football practice after high school lets out. His days are filled with early mornings and late nights. The Wildcats finished 7-3 this past season and qualified for the Class 5A playoffs for the first time since 2013.

“With football, it’s a relationship that is going to break your heart. You have to accept that,” Pyatt said. “You will come to a bump in the road, more often than not. But you always gravitate back to football because it’s what taught you to be resilient and respond to failure in the first place.”

Reborn into the game

Flora’s lesson to players can be about more than edge pass rushing and the three-point stance. He went from playing college ball on national TV to sleeping on the beach next to other drug addicts.

“If even one kid can hear what I went through, the struggles and the pain, maybe it can help,” he said. “I’ve got that spark back in me. Even though I’m not playing, I’m able to show the kids how to do it right.”

What happens to a player after football finishes demands a rebirth. Some players ease off to another endeavor outside the game. Some spend their lives vainly reliving old glory. Some never find a new purpose.

And some go through hell only to end up right back where they started. Flora suffered more than most. Only his family finally saved him. Both families.

“It took a lot of time to forgive the football gods,” Flora said. “Football is all I ever knew. I thought I could take it to the next level. And in a snap, it was over. I didn’t know how to live life without football.”

He will never again strap on pads and play, even if he thinks he can. But being around the game is enough to fill the void that nearly swallowed him.

“No one should have to hurt people the way I did,” Flora said. “There can be a happy ending.”",13/01/2018
The Denver Post,"Farming plays surprising role in air pollution deaths, study finds","WASHINGTON — Air pollution is killing 3.3 million people a year worldwide, according to a new study that includes this surprise: Farming plays a large role in smog and soot deaths in industrial nations.

Scientists in Germany, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia and Harvard University calculated the most detailed estimates yet of the toll of air pollution. The study also projects that if trends don’t change, the yearly death total will double to about 6.6 million a year by 2050.

The study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, used health statistics and computer models. About three quarters of the deaths are from strokes and heart attacks, said lead author Jos Lelieveld at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany.

“About 6 percent of all global deaths each year occur prematurely due to exposure to ambient air pollution. This number is higher than most experts would have expected, say, 10 years ago,” said Jason West, a University of North Carolina environmental sciences professor who wasn’t part of the study but praised it.

Air pollution kills more than HIV and malaria combined, Lelieveld said.

With nearly 1.4 million deaths a year, China has the most air pollution fatalities, followed by India with 645,000 and Pakistan with 110,000.

The United States, with 54,905 deaths in 2010 from soot and smog, ranks seventh highest for air pollution deaths. What’s unusual is that the study says that agriculture caused 16,221 of those deaths, second only to 16,929 deaths blamed on power plants.

In the U.S. Northeast, as well as in Europe, Russia, Japan and South Korea, agriculture is the No. 1 cause of the soot and smog deaths, according to the study. Worldwide, agriculture is the No. 2 cause with 664,100 deaths, behind the more than 1 million deaths from in-home heating and cooking done with wood and other biofuels in the developing world.

In the U.S. West, the main cause of soot and smog premature deaths is traffic emissions.

The problem with farms is ammonia from fertilizer and animal waste, Lelieveld said.

That ammonia then combines with sulfates from coal-fired power plants and nitrates from car exhaust to form the soot particles that are the big air pollution killers, he said.",16/09/2015

The Denver Post,Surgical tech’s case exposes multiple failings in patient protections,"Rocky Allen’s long road of addiction passed through five hospitals, four states and a deployment in Afghanistan.

One hospital said it found him swapping a doctor’s fentanyl with a syringe of saline solution and informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Another discovered him passed out on the floor and, upon testing him for drugs, found fentanyl in his system.

A Phoenix hospital hired Allen three weeks after a nearby hospital fired him. All of this happened after he was court-martialed for fentanyl theft nearly five years ago as a surgical tech who had enlisted in the Navy.

Yet nobody stopped him until he had p ut thousands of patients at risk for hepatitis and HIV at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, where he worked for five months before an employee reported he took a fentanyl syringe and replaced it with another that did not contain the drug.

The repeated failures highlight a stunning lack of communication among government agencies and hospitals.

Allen touted his Navy experience on job applications but did not mention his court-martial. That never stopped him from finding hospitals where he could get fentanyl, a powerful narcotic painkiller.

The DEA requires hospitals to report drug thefts but doesn’t ask for names and keeps the information in law enforcement circles. Most states don’t regulate surgical techs at all. At one hospital, training amounted to an in-house course that turned housekeepers into operating room assistants.

And hospitals aren’t required to notify local law enforcement officials about drug thefts, so often they keep quiet.

“Drug addiction and diversion by our health care providers has reached epic proportions. It occurs daily in all hospitals. And it’s a serious growing risk to patient safety,” said Hollynd Hoskins, a lawyer who sued on behalf of patients infected in 2009 by another surgical tech, Kristen Parker.

She now represents more than 80 patients who had surgery at Swedish.

While some changes were made in the wake of the Parker case, in which 26 patients were infected with hepatitis C, they were mainly local and did nothing to stop Allen.

Despite their access to narcotic drugs, surgical techs are not regulated on the national level, nor in 37 states. Colorado, one state that does, requires only that they register and does not check their backgrounds or have an educational requirement.

By federal law, a national database tracks all medical malpractice payments and adverse state licensing and certification actions against physicians and nurses. Hospitals, law enforcement agencies and state regulators have access to that database. Since most states don’t regulate surgical techs, they aren’t tracked.

Regulations require narcotics to be kept under lock and key or closely monitored, but that doesn’t always occur. And even when surgical techs get caught stealing drugs, they can find new hospital jobs by hiding their past.

Holly Falcon has worked for 13 years as a surgical technologist in Colorado and Louisiana and serves as vice president of the national Association of Surgical Technologists.

She’s not surprised that Allen repeatedly managed to take fentanyl syringes from operating rooms.

“Unfortunately, it’s not that hard,” she said. “There are times when the narcotic can be left out on top of the anesthesia cart. Anesthesiologists are supposed to keep them in their possession, but sometimes they set them up and then they leave the room. During this time, the surgical tech is usually in the room alone.”

This occurs despite policies requiring anesthesiologists never to leave drugs unattended, she said. “Some anesthesiologists are good at following that policy, and some are not so good.”

Outbreaks

Since Parker, a former heroin addict with hepatitis, pleaded guilty to federal charges of stealing painkillers intended for Rose Medical Center patients, at least two outbreaks of the disease nationwide have been linked to drug-addicted health facility employees, records show.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said at least 50 patients were infected with hepatitis in those outbreaks, including a man who died.

Allen’s case could end up being a third outbreak.

A federal grand jury in Denver indicted Allen, 28, this month on charges that he had stolen a syringe filled with the painkiller fentanyl intended for patients at Swedish.

Those charges followed an eyewitness report that Allen had walked into the wrong operating room, grabbed a fentanyl syringe and replaced it with a syringe that was found to contain no fentanyl.

He has pleaded not guilty.

Nearly 2,900 Swedish patents are undergoing testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C. Authorities have said Allen carries a bloodborne pathogen. Those pathogens include, but are not limited to, the diseases for which hospitals are offering tests.

Several Swedish patients say they have tested positive for hepatitis B, but they say officials at the hospital have suggested to them they contracted the disease somewhere else.

“They need to clean house in that hospital, and all of these hospitals need to hunker down,” said a 56-year-old man who fears he contracted hepatitis B during a spinal surgery in October at Swedish. “Didn’t they learn before? Hospitals should know by now that this fentanyl is a top priority. It’s like leaving cocaine around.”

The man, who did not want to be identified for privacy reasons, said his blood test showed he has hepatitis B. Previous blood tests never detected any problems, and he’s never had any symptoms in the past, he said.

“I’m not a drug user,” he said. “I’ve been married 40 years.”

He said he has struggled with lethargy, a lack of appetite and night sweats during the past few weeks.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment officials say it may be months before they disclose whether Allen infected anyone because he’s the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation and origins of a blood infection can be hard to prove. Many are likely to have been carrying one of those diseases already.

According to Dr. Lisa Miller, the department’s chief of communicable diseases, one of 93 residents is known to have hepatitis C, one in 417 is HIV positive and one in 607 carries hepatitis B.

“Most of them know they’ve tested positive. Some of them won’t. That’s a lot to sort out,” she said.

Among those who have not tested positive before, lab tests by the CDC may help determine whether a single person’s blood is the source.

Stiffer regulation

After the Parker case in 2009, state lawmakers passed surgical technologist regulation and a law that allows hospitals to share information about applicants without risking liability.

But even though surgical techs must be registered, the state does not perform background checks or verify the information on the registration form. They are not required to demonstrate a basic level of competency through certification.

Oversight for nurses and doctors “is much more comprehensive, and it also connects all the states” because state licensing boards share information, said Steven Summer, president of the Colorado Hospital Association.

For surgical techs, he said, “we do need some kind of a national system that doesn’t make state borders porous for an individual like this.”

Critics of the latest disaster for patients note that Rose Medical Center, where Parker worked, and Swedish are both part of the HealthOne system.

But Summer credited Colorado hospitals for undertaking a comprehensive education program after the Parker case, and he praised Swedish for putting those reforms to work.

“It’s interesting that it took a Colorado hospital to identify this and take this from the workforce,” he said — unlike “California or Arizona that decided let’s let this be someone else’s problem.”

But the theft of powerful drugs by hospital employees remains an ongoing problem, and is rising. There have been 400 cases in Colorado since 2010, according to the state health department.

Those include:

• A nurse at Sterling Regional MedCenter stealing 73 vials of fentanyl in June 2014. The nurse, who admitted taking painkillers that were intended for patients not under her care, was convicted of drug possession, a Class 4 felony. She received a two-year deferred sentence and was placed on probation for two years. The Colorado Board of Nursing allowed the nurse to keep her license but required her to seek assistance from a drug abuse prevention and intervention program.

• In 2012, McKee Medical Center in Loveland fired a surgical technologist, who was seen by another employee “huffing anesthesia gases” from an anesthesia machine, according to state nursing board records. The state suspended her registration to work as a surgical tech.

• A nurse at Swedish admitted to stealing injectable hydromorphone intended for patients for at least three months in 2014. The nurse tested positive for the use of hydromorphone, fentanyl and benzodiazepines. The state’s nursing board ordered the nurse to enter a drug abuse prevention and intervention program.

• A nurse admitted in 2014 stealing Dilaudid, fentanyl and morphine from the hospitals where he worked that were intended for patients. He entered a drug treatment program, but was later found to be out of compliance with that program. The nurse relinquished his license.

Daniel Levinson, inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, has said the risk to patients from drug-addicted health care workers is so great that hospitals should be required to randomly drug test all health care workers with access to drugs. He has noted that such drug testing is required for those employed in other high-risk positions, such as pilots, truck drivers and ship captains.

Levinson also has stressed the need for hospitals to report health care workers who steal drugs to law enforcement for prosecution.

Need and risk

Among hospital workers, surgical technologists are relatively low paid and in great demand. Average pay is $22.83 an hour, according to the Association of Surgical Technologists. Allen asked for salaries in the $40,000 range from the hospitals that hired him.

Like other surgical techs, he was responsible for setting up a sterile field in the operating room, laying out equipment and supplies and passing instruments to a surgeon when asked.

He also belonged to a rare group: unregulated hospital workers with access to narcotics.

Among members of a surgical team, “we are the only ones that are not comprehensively regulated,” said Catherine Sparkman, director of government affairs for the national Association of Surgical Technologists.

The association favors stronger regulation “in the interest of patient safety,” she said. “Every patient deserves a certified surgical technologist, someone competent and capable at the operating table.”

Allen wasn’t certified, and he moved easily from hospital to hospital by omitting names of hospitals that had fired him.

Unattended surgical carts with syringes on them became a major issue in lawsuits filed against Rose Medical Center and anesthesiologists following the 2009 outbreaks linked to Parker, a hospital that like Swedish is affiliated with HCA.

In that litigation, an anesthesiologist said in a deposition that her standard practice was to draw up medications before surgery, then hide the drugs in unlocked operating-room carts underneath intubation tubes or other equipment. She said that when she left the room to accompany post-operative patients, she trusted hospital personnel.

Several patients who had surgery at Swedish have said they came out of surgery experiencing excruciating pain, a sign that should have clued in hospital administrators that something was awry, said Jim Avery, who is representing some of those patients. Those patients now think their medications were swiped by Allen, and they were injected with something other than fentanyl.

“This is a big red flag when these people are coming off the table in the recovery room screaming in pain,” Avery said. “Usually people are coming to and don’t feel any pain. That’s an alarming fact that should go in occurrence reports. Those are supposed to identify trends.”

Rob Brown, a Vietnam veteran, said he suffered for 2½ days after what he expected would be a routine hernia surgery.

He has undergone dozens of surgeries since a land mine blew off part of his left leg in Vietnam, and “this was just totally off the wall different,” he said. “It hurt to breathe, I couldn’t turn or twist, I just prayed not to sneeze.”

Long-term consequences

Even when a surgical tech is caught stealing fentanyl and replacing it with a syringe filled with saline solution, the consequences may amount to nothing more than working at a different hospital.

That happened in La Jolla, Calif., where a hospital reported Allen stole a fentanyl syringe, concealed it in his sock, and acknowledged he planned to inject the drug.

Scripps Green Hospital fired him. The hospital also reported the theft of a controlled substance to the DEA, as required, on June 7, 2013.

And nothing happened to prevent Allen from doing the same thing at other hospitals.

The DEA provided a copy of the theft report Scripps sent. It described an “employee pilferage” of fentanyl valued at $5. The form did not ask for the alleged thief’s identity, and the hospital did not provide it or call police.

The Controlled Substances Act “advises hospitals to conduct criminal background checks of employees who will handle controlled substances and to check for past controlled substance violations,” spokeswoman Amy Roderick said. “It is the responsibility of the hospital to determine that a prospective employee is safe to hire as its agent in a position that involves dispensing controlled substances.”

But when asked if the DEA would inform a hospital about a drug diverter who had not been charged criminally, she replied, “DEA does not get involved in any employer’s hiring process.”

Janice Collins, a Scripps spokeswoman, said the hospital reported the theft to DEA the day of the incident.

“We believed taking that action and terminating Mr. Allen were the appropriate steps to protect our patients,” she said. “At the time, we had no reason to believe this was anything other than an isolated incident.”

Now the hospital is offering free blood tests to patients who had surgery while he worked there.

From California, Allen went to work at two Arizona hospitals in 2014, Banner Thunderbird in Glendale and HonorHealth John C. Lincoln in Phoenix.

The Phoenix hospital hired him three weeks after Banner Thunderbird fired him. John C. Lincoln fired Allen after he tested positive for fentanyl. Neither Arizona hospital will say whether it filed any reports with the DEA concerning Allen, and the DEA would not say if it received any.

Erica Curry, a spokeswoman for the DEA office in Phoenix, said drug-diversion reports are closely held unless criminal charges are filed.

“The DEA only shares investigative information that has been reported to them with other law enforcement agencies,” she said.

In states that do not require certification of surgical techs, hospitals set their own standards and may train them on the job. In California, for example, a Sonoma County hospital decided to recruit surgical techs in-house by offering training to housekeeping workers.",27/02/2016
The Denver Post,Graphic details emerge in case of Aurora man accused of sex-trafficking boys,"New and lurid details came to light Tuesday during hours of detectives’ testimony about an Aurora man’s alleged sex trafficking of boys, revealing another underage victim and a social media app that prosecutors say aided in the crimes .

Sean Crumpler, 48, entered the Arapahoe District Courtroom to face counts of trafficking sexual servitude of a minor, pattern child sex assault by one in a position of trust and sexual contact with a child through coercion.

Prosecutors say Crumpler is also charged with one count of a sexual offense with notice of HIV and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

Detective Chris Fanning, a member of the FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force in Denver, pointed out Crumpler sitting in court in a grey suit with bleached blonde hair. Fanning said the defendant was the same man he saw while executing a search warrant of Crumpler’s Aurora home in the 23000 block of East Hinsdale Place.

Fanning went on to describe how about a dozen boys and men ranging from 16 to 21 ended up living under Crumpler’s roof with the expectation that housing, food, drugs, alcohol and luxuries like new iPhones would be given to them in exchange for sexual favors with Crumpler and others living in the house.

“It was understood that if you were going to live there, you were going to have sex with Mr. Crumpler,” Fanning said.

Many of the house occupants were found by Crumpler through Grindr, Fanning said, which he described as a social network and dating website for primarily the gay community.

Prosecutors argued that Crumpler, who was called “Daddy” by many of his house occupants due to his screenname on Grindr, seemed to prey on vulnerable young men such as runaways.

“They had no place to go,” Fanning said.

Crumpler often paid for the boys to be driven from California to his home, Fanning said.

One victim, who was 17 during part of his stay at Aurora house, later told investigators that he “immediately” had sexual intercourse with Crumpler upon meeting him.

During an August search warrant of Crumpler’s spacious home, Investigator Penelope Gallegos with the Innocence Lost Task Force documented graphic details found inside including sex toys, a variety of documents such as different social security cards and a high school identification card. Nearly every surface was coated in semen, she said.

“It was in every room on everything,” she said.

Hanging in a hallway was a chore chart that apparently dictated cleaning responsibilities, Gallegos said.

Fanning said this chart exemplified the authoratitive relationship Crumpler had over the household.

Also found in the home were many bottles of alcohol, marijuana and drug paraphernalia, Gallegos said.

One of Crumpler’s underrage victims told investigators that his job was to “recruit younger kids,” Fanning said.

An underrage runaway who was staying with Crumpler was initially upset when investigators confronted him about Crumpler, Fanning said, and the alleged sexual crimes that took place.

“He was upset he was going back to California,” Fanning said, adding that the boy worried for Crumpler’s future.

“He was more sad than anything.”

Crumpler was convicted of a sex crime in January 2004 in California. He registered as a sex offender in Colorado, at the Hinsdale address, on March 31 according to records.

The FBI said Crumpler’s case was “extremely unusual,” noting that cases that involve luring multiple male sex-trafficking victims across state lines to be kept in the same home is rare.

The Denver Post,Denver heroin users could use supervised injection site if proposal passes multiple hurdles,"In semi-private booths, each with a chair and a mirror, Denver heroin users could shoot up with clean needles, no threat of arrest and under the supervision of staff trained to jump in with a life-saving antidote in case of overdose.

It would look more like a medical clinic than a party lounge, with floors and furniture that workers could hose down in the event of vomit or blood spills. Staffers would hand out sterile needles and possibly distilled water, but clients would bring their own drugs to cook and inject.

It’s called a supervised injection site, and Denver is on a path to become one of the first U.S. cities to open one — although doing so would require action by the City Council, the state legislature and possibly the federal government.

Seattle and San Francisco, ahead of Denver in planning, are attempting to open the first sites in this country, although there are more than 100 around the world.

Cities in Canada, Australia and Europe with supervised injection sites have seen fewer overdose deaths, reduced public drug use and decreased dropped syringes. A review of 75 studies found the sites were not linked to increased drug use or crime.

In Denver, officials supportive of the idea want fewer used needles dropped in city parks and hidden in the vines along the Cherry Creek bike path. They want fewer people using drugs in alleys along 16th Street Mall and overdosing in public bathroom stalls.

In 2016, 174 people died of overdoses in Denver. Twenty of them died in a public park, alley or bathroom.

Michael Torpacka, who first tried heroin at age 13, looks for empty alleys and bathrooms around downtown Denver multiple times a day to get his fix. Now 37, he lives on the city’s streets. He rushes through the cooking to boil his heroin. He rushes through the injection. He’s always nervous someone will see him and call police.

“You’re scared and you don’t have time to get this done,” he said Thursday.

Torpacka predicted Denver would see fewer needles in parks and along the river — and have fewer people using bathroom stalls to get high — if the city were to open a supervised injection site.

A plan to open a pilot site in Denver is part of legislation that won unanimous, bipartisan approval Tuesday from a 10-member legislative committee looking for solutions to Colorado’s opioid crisis. But the real test comes in January, when the General Assembly convenes and takes up the issue in its regular session.

The Denver City Council is intrigued, too. Council president Albus Brooks plans to lead a trip leaving Wednesday to Vancouver, British Columbia, to visit that city’s injection clinic, called InSite, which opened in 2003. It was the first in North America.

The Canadian Supreme Court is to settle a conflict between the government's wishes to close the center and the center's success in fighting the spread of AIDS among drug addicts. In eight years of existence, and with more 600 visits per day on average, Insite believes it has made advances in the fight against AIDS.

The momentum behind a Denver site comes largely from Lisa Raville, executive director of the Harm Reduction Action Center, a treatment and counseling center. It provides users with clean needles and naloxone, the antidote to an opioid overdose.

The center on Colfax Avenue, across from the state Capitol, collects about 3,500 used syringes each morning — a total of 16,848 in the last week. In a two-week stretch in January, seven of the center’s clients died, six from overdose and one from an aneurysm related to shooting drugs into the lower extremities.

That’s when Raville told her board of directors it was time to push for a supervised injection site. “It’s time,” Raville said. “We’ve lost too many people.”

She wants to put the supervised injection site inside her center, where the neighbors include the Colorado Department of Education, the Capitol and a Vietnamese pho restaurant. But the ultimate location is likely to be a point of intense discussion among public officials.

Looking for safe space

In a storage room at the center — an area potentially large enough to fit a supervised injection site — five clients who inject methamphetamine and heroin, including Torpacka, described sneaking around Denver looking for a safe place to get high.

Hurried and scared, they worry about not properly boiling the drug before injecting it. They worry about injecting it into a muscle instead of a vein, causing an abscess. They worry about not having clean skin and getting a skin infection.

They worry about children seeing them do it even when they are hiding their lighters under their coats, and they worry about looking nonchalant as they walk past management to use public bathrooms. Most of all, they worry about dropping dead in an alley, only to be discovered by a kid taking out the trash.

“We’re people too. We care what people think,” said Xavier, a 25-year-old couch-surfer. He did not want his last name published. “Imagine if we could do this someplace safe and we wouldn’t have to be in Civic Center park embarrassing the (expletive) out of ourselves?”

“If I die in the alley behind the trash can, how do I have a chance to improve my life?” asked Vernon Lewis. He said he would use a supervised injection site because it would be safer than using heroin alone in his apartment. “It’s terrifying,” he said of the risk.

Besides the likelihood of reducing drug use in public places, supervised injection sites also could serve as a first step in a user’s recovery, advocates and physicians say. Similar to a needle exchange, staffers would offer information on treatment when people came in to use drugs.

Dr. Steve Sherick, an emergency department physician and chair of the Denver Medical Society board, says he has treated “thousands” of opioid-addicted patients. And they are living “hour by hour.”

For them, he said, injecting drugs in a safe zone — where staff members are on hand to make sure they don’t die — is perhaps a step closer to thinking “week by week.”

The Denver Medical Society and the Colorado Medical Society are in favor of opening an injection site as part of a “comprehensive strategy” to fight the opioid epidemic.

“People are dying already,” Sherick said. “Shaming them clearly does not stop them from being addicted to drugs. What I want to do, from a doctor’s standpoint, is to try to stop people from dying.”

Shooting up at library

At this point, the Denver Public Library’s central location downtown has become a de-facto city injection site, albeit unsanctioned — and without the safeguards of a dedicated facility.

The problem is so rampant that library employees are trained to use naloxone on injection-drug users they find unconscious in the bathrooms. Other popular spots to inject include a downtown bus depot, bathrooms in Union Station and various homeless camps.

“This is a trial,” Sherick said of a potential safe injection site. “Let’s try it. If it doesn’t work, we can close it.”

But opening a site in Denver wouldn’t be as simple as a legislative vote. For one thing, while the city health department has been exploring the issue, Mayor Michael Hancock’s administration is not ready to endorse the idea.

Nationally, a handful of cities and states have looked at the possibility of opening injection sites, while federal officials have offered only a long-standing federal prohibition against maintaining premises for the purpose of using a controlled substance. Last week, a commission convened by President Donald Trump notably left out of its recommendations any support for sanctioning supervised injection sites.

That hasn’t stopped some places from trying — most prominently Seattle, which has put in a bid to be the first in the United States.

In January, Seattle’s mayor and the executive of King County announced they would support opening two injection sites, one in the city and one elsewhere in the county. But it has been a struggle. City after city, including several with prevalent opioid abuse, has passed an ordinance preemptively banning injection sites.

Elsewhere, California, Maryland and Maine are among states that have considered legislation in the last year to allow cities to set up injection sites, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But those efforts have failed in the face of opposition from legislators concerned about violating federal drug laws or sending the wrong message by, in their eyes, sanctioning illicit drug use.

In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, accused a Baltimore-based Democratic lawmaker who sponsored safe-injection site legislation of “trying to legalize heroin.”

Spikes in disease

Until their states’ legislators act, cities such as San Francisco and Baltimore may have little legal cover to open safe injection sites — although that hasn’t stopped San Francisco’s leaders from pressing forward.

Dr. Robert Valuck, who coordinates the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention, says he doesn’t expect that a pilot site in Denver would draw scrutiny from federal law enforcement officials.

“Right now, people are injecting in libraries, public buildings, business bathrooms, parkways, public spaces. People are injecting. Period,” he said, noting that spikes in HIV and hepatitis probably are due to sharing needles. “So we really need to figure this out.”

Brooks, the council president, says he will be joined on his trip to the Canadian clinic by an assistant city attorney and by his office staff. Besides visiting InSite, they planned to meet with Vancouver’s mayor, police chief and a City Council member.

Despite the recent push, Brooks has no illusion that an injection site will open anytime soon in Denver. He still has questions about how one would operate, he said — and he sees a treatment component as necessary “for it to be palatable in Denver.”

The idea faces uncertainty that includes not only the federal prohibition but effective bans on such a center at both the state and local levels that would need to be repealed.

Brooks has worked with state Rep. Leslie Herod, a Denver Democrat, on the issue but says he is most encouraged lately by the involvement of another lawmaker who has stepped up as a sponsor for the state bill: Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs.

“We’re still a long way from it,” Brooks said, “but the fact that Republicans are coming on board is huge. And I hate to give credit, but President Trump” — by declaring opioid abuse a public health emergency in late October — “I think that was really good, and it helped Republicans see that this is a really big issue.”

Brooks cites a personal connection — an experience with prescription painkiller OxyContin last year that scared him. In July 2016, doctors removed a 15-pound, 6-inch-diameter tumor near his pelvis.

“I went through one of the largest surgeries — opened up twice in three weeks,” Brooks said. “And I had to take a lot of medicine, and I had to wean myself off of it. It was a big issue. And I just realized that a lot of people without the same support network and privilege that I have would end up in a really bad situation.”

He wasn’t addicted to the OxyContin, he said, but he felt the drug’s hooks in him. It took about a month of gradually reducing the dosage to stop. “What’s accurate is that I went through a state of withdrawals on it,” he said.

In the next couple months, Brooks and Herod will hold a series of community meetings to educate the public on safe-injection facilities and to gauge concerns. The first is set for 5:30 p.m. Nov. 30 at United Way, 711 Park Avenue West.

The Denver Post,Needle-disposal kiosk installed along Cherry Creek trail in Denver,"Denver has installed a needle disposal kiosk on the Cherry Creek trail near Colfax Avenue and Speer Boulevard as part of a project to see whether more are necessary in other parts of the city.

The kiosk was installed last week. The box is anchored to the ground and has a slot similar to a mailbox. The pre-printed sign explaining the box’s use is on back-order and will be installed later.

This is the first city-led needle disposal container in Denver. The location was chosen because it had been viewed as a hotspot for drug use, and used needles had been accumulating in the area.

“One of the primary reasons is we had gotten a number of complaints from employees and the public concerned about being stuck by needles,” said Meghan Hughes, spokeswoman for Denver Environmental Health, which will handle needle disposal. “This addresses a public safety issue.”

The pilot project is a partnership among the city’s Office of Drug Strategy, Environmental Health, Parks and Recreation and mayor’s office. Outside organizations such as the Harm Reduction Action Center and Colorado AIDS Project are also involved.

The Harm Reduction Action Center is the state’s largest public health agency that works with people who inject drugs. The organization runs needle exchange programs in collaboration with the Colorado AIDS Project.

The groups also have needle-disposal containers at both of their locations, the Denver Central Library downtown and the King Soopers at 13th Avenue and Speer. The new kiosk on the Cherry Creek Trail will be the only one with 24-hour access.

Lisa Raville, executive director of the Harm Reduction Action Center, said the disposal kiosk is a much more convenient way to dispose of a needle properly .

“The state health department tells you to put (needles) in coffee can, cover it with duct tape and throw it away,” she said.

Raville added that three in four people who inject are Hepatitis C positive, and one in 10 are HIV positive. She noted that these diseases can be greatly diminished by proper needle disposal.

The pilot project will run for a year as city staff determines whether the kiosk greatly reduces complaints in this area. More kiosks could be coming if the program is deemed successful.

“It’s been a really exciting time,” Raville said. “We’re getting lots of positive feedback so far.”

The Denver Post,Fact check: John Hickenlooper stumbles over details on aid-in-dying measure,"Editor’s note: This is the first in a series of fact-checking articles produced by CU News Corps for The Denver Post that will run during the election cycle. CU News Corps is a University of Colorado program run by journalism faculty and students.

Gov. John Hickenlooper discussed several of Colorado’s statewide ballot initiatives, including Proposition 106, the Colorado End-of-Life Options Act, during a Sept. 1 interview on Colorado Public Radio’s “Colorado Matters.”

Much of the measure’s language mirrors that of Oregon’s and Washington’s Death with Dignity laws, and the governor cited those states’ experiences when offering tentative support for Proposition 106.

While one of the governor’s statements about those states’ laws during the interview is verifiably true, two are not entirely accurate and could be misleading.

Related Articles February 2, 2016 Should Colorado legislature pass aid in dying act? (2 letters)

Colorado Matters: An initiative for medically assisted death. This would allow terminally ill patients to get prescriptions for drugs they could use to end their lives.

Hickenlooper: Yes, and I think the fact that you have to have multiple doctors sign off on this, that it’s been used in Oregon and Washington without calamity, and very, very few people take advantage of this… It’s interesting that one of the studies we saw, I think it was 1,400 or 1,500 patients applied for the drugs because they were in such pain that they wanted to take their lives. And then more than a third chose not to. But having it there…

Colorado Matters: Hmm. So you support the idea of this.

Hickenlooper: I’d say I’m sympathetic to it and leaning towards supporting it.

Below are the governor’s statements, followed by the facts:

“Very, very few people take advantage of this.”

This is true. The Oregon Public Health Division’s annual mortality and Death with Dignity Act reports show that since 1998, Oregon’s first full year with the act, less than 1 percent of Oregon residents who died from cancer (0.5 percent), heart disease (0.01 percent), chronic lower respiratory disease (0.1 percent) or HIV/AIDS (0.2 percent) ingested medicine prescribed under the act.

The ingestion rate is higher for individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease). Since 1998, 4 percent of all Oregon residents who died from ALS ingested medicine prescribed under the act.

Washington’s annual mortality and Death with Dignity reports from 2010 through 2014 show a similar pattern, with less than 1 percent of residents who died from cancer (0.77 percent) or heart disease having taken advantage of the act’s provisions. (Washington’s data does not allow comparison between medicated deaths and total deaths for neurodegenerative diseases like ALS.)

“One of the studies we saw, I think it was 1,400 or 1,500 patients applied for the drugs … And then more than a third chose not to [take them].”

These numbers are not entirely accurate, though they track better with Oregon’s experience than with Washington’s.

It’s true that 1,545 Oregonians have been written prescriptions under the act, according to a February 2016 report by the Oregon Public Health Division. Of those applicants, 64 percent are confirmed to have ingested the medication and died.

However, of the remaining patients, only 24 percent are confirmed to have died without ingesting the medication. The outcome for the remaining 11 percent is unknown, and some still may have chosen to take the medication. Since 2008, Oregon’s annual Death with Dignity reports have indicated that no fewer than six prescription holders a year get the prescription in one year, but ingest it in another.

Hickenlooper’s estimate aligns even less with Washington’s experience. Since that state’s Death with Dignity Act went into effect in 2009, the Washington State Department of Health reports that 873 residents have received prescriptions under the act, and over 70 percent have died as a result of ingesting the medication.

Of the remaining 30 percent of Washington’s prescription recipients, just under 14 percent are confirmed to have died of their underlying illness without ingesting the medication. The outcome of the remaining 16 percent of recipients is unknown.

In 2015, Washington’s Death with Dignity participants skewed even further toward ingesting the medication. Nearly 78 percent of prescription holders ingested the medication and died in 2015, with 11 percent dying from their underlying illness and 11 percent unknown.

“Patients applied for the drugs because they were in such pain that they wanted to take their lives.”

The governor’s assertion that patients apply for a Death with Dignity prescription primarily because they are in extreme pain is not accurate.

When a patient in Oregon or Washington dies from ingesting a prescription obtained through the act, the attending physician is required to complete an after-death reporting form that includes an indication of whether the patient’s request for the prescription was influenced by any of seven listed end-of-life concerns.

In 2015, the top three concerns reported in both states were of the patient being less able to engage in activities that make life enjoyable (Oregon, 96 percent; Washington, 86 percent), steadily losing autonomy (Oregon, 92 percent; Washington, 86 percent) and losing dignity (Oregon, 75 percent; Washington, 69 percent).

Experiencing inadequate control of pain now or in the future was the second least common concern, with only 28 percent of Oregon and 36 percent of Washington attending physicians citing it as a reason for the patient’s request.

Ultimately, quality-of-life concerns appear to motivate at least three times more Death with Dignity patients to request a prescription than pain.

Ultimately, although Hickenlooper is correct that Oregon and Washington’s death with dignity laws are used by very few people, his assessment of the number of patients who ingest the lethal medication and the grounds cited for taking the medication are wide of the mark.

The Denver Post,Denver’s “Red Ball” brings awareness to World AIDS Day with hair and runway show,"A Rachel Marie Hurst model poses backstage at Red Ball. (Francie Swidler, The Denver Post)

Not everyone in Denver was at Sports Authority Field at Mile High Sunday night.

November 29 was also the evening of Denver’s seventh annual Red Ball, a night of big fashion and big hair produced by the Colorado AIDS Project, aimed at fundraising and bringing awareness to World AIDS Day (Dec. 1).

Each year in August, dozens of Denver-based clothing designers and hair salons apply to be part of Red Ball.

A little less than half of the applications make the cut.

After being selected, salons and designers are matched together into “teams” and get to work, collaborating on often over-the-top clothing and hair creations with only a few months to spare.

Many of the designers put their day jobs on hold to create special, elaborate collections specifically for the event, rather than selecting ready-to-wear pieces that may already be hanging in their studios.

It’s no surprise that the event is such a dear and beloved one among Denver’s creative community — it supports an organization close to the hearts of many.

The Colorado AIDS Project helps hundreds in the metro area through health education services, financial and housing assistance, substance abuse counseling and more. The goal is to help the community live healthier by educating those at risk of HIV, and working with them to choose safer behaviors.

It can be easy however for that sentiment to take a backseat to all the extravagant hair and costume-style fashion that often takes over the night.

On Sunday though, one designer-stylist team made sure that message was heard loud and clear.

“This year we are about the power of words,” Anne Fanganello, the designer of Anna Festa told me backstage. “What words can do and how they can affect you.”

“We have something happening that nobody knows about. We’re doing a protest – we’re literally doing a protest on the runway. Are we here because of the beautiful clothes and beautiful hair? Yes….but really, it’s about the message. ‘Get tested,’ ‘Stop aids,’ ‘Support the people out there.'”

Anna Festa was assigned to work with Belle and Beau Salon — and while the pairing was random — they both shared the same vision.

“For me, its bigger than a hair show and a fashion show,” said Josh Coyne of Belle and Beau.

Coyne cuts hair pro-bono at the Colorado AIDS Project the first Tuesday of every month.

“More people need to know why [Colorado AIDS Project is] here, who they’re helping, why they’re helping, and how much they really do for people.”

Yes, the fashion on the runway was big, and the hair was even bigger. But it was “protest” created by Anna Festa and Belle and Beau Salon that had the biggest impact of the night.

“We’re going to make a huge statement,” Coyne said.

They did.

“We’re not focusing on the hair or the designs. We’re focused on the messages on those boards.”

The Denver Post,Swedish hospital surgical tech court-martialed for drug theft in 2011,"The surgical technologist whose alleged theft of powerful liquid painkillers may have exposed thousands of hospital patients to disease was court-martialed in 2011 for stealing the same drugs while deployed with an Army unit in Afghanistan.

During that court-martial, Rocky Allen pleaded guilty to making a false official statement, wrongfully possessing about 30 vials of fentanyl, wrongly possessing a syringe containing fentanyl, stealing fentanyl and stealing a syringe containing fentanyl, according to a summary released Friday by military authorities.

Allen went on to work at four hospitals in three states, all of which fired him, before he came to Colorado. Swedish Medical Center in Englewood hired him in August and fired him last month after he allegedly was caught swapping a fentanyl syringe with one containing none of the drug.

Swedish alerted authorities, and Allen now faces federal drug-diversion charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The hospital is offering tests for hepatitis and HIV to 2,900 patients, and several other hospitals are offering tests. Authorities said Allen has a bloodborne pathogen but gave no more details.

The records of the court-martial would have been available to any of the hospitals if they had requested them as part of a hiring background check process, said Jennifer Zeldis, a public affairs officer with the Office of the Judge Advocate General of Navy. She added that a telephone call from a hospital to the Navy’s personnel command inquiring about Allen’s military service also would have revealed the court martial.

The Navy released the information in response to a request from The Denver Post.

Allen was enlisted in the Navy, where he was a surgical tech, but was deployed with an Army unit in Afghanistan. The court-martial was convened by the Army.

He was sentenced to 90 days’ confinement, which was reduced to 60 days in accordance with a pretrial agreement, the summary showed. He also received a one-step reduction in rank. About six months later, he received a general discharge from the Navy.

Records show that Allen regularly touted his military experience when seeking jobs with hospitals. Whether the hospitals that hired him followed up by probing his past military experiences is unclear.

During a court hearing Feb. 19, prosecutors submitted in federal court some of the applications Allen submitted to hospitals.

In an application to HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix, which hired him in 2014, Allen wrote: “Great critical thinker with years of training and skills working under stress and reacting quickly to emergency patient care situations to include the one year I spent at the NATO Role 3 hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy.”

He said in that application that he left the military because of the end of his enlistment. He granted permission for the hospital to contact the Navy as a reference before hiring him.

The person who interviewed him for that job recorded that Allen had mentioned during the interview that he had experienced some conflict with another tech during his deployment in Afghanistan. He said he let his leaders handle the conflict.

The Phoenix hospital fired Allen after he tested positive for fentanyl.

When he sought a job as a surgical tech in 2013 at Scripps Green Hospital in La Jolla, Calif., he stated on his application: “My time in the military has thought (sic) me to become and (sic) outstanding leader. I can bring an aspect to the team that not many can, my experiences have molded my way of thinking.”

He was hired by Scripps in May 2013 but was fired a month later after he was observed replacing a doctor’s fentanyl syringe with a syringe filled with saline, according to court documents. When confronted, he produced the fentanyl syringe, which he had hidden in his sock, and admitted that he planned to inject it, his termination letter there states.

Scripps officials notified the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration of the theft but not the local police.

He was fired by Northwest Hospital & Medical Center in Seattle in March 2012 after working there for less than three months.

Allen also worked at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale, Ariz., for about six weeks in 2014.

Allen’s termination records from Swedish state he was observed in an operating room to which he was not assigned. A witness saw him take a syringe of fentanyl and saw him replace it with another syringe that did not contain fentanyl, that document states.

In the federal court hearing, Allen’s lawyer disclosed that his client had drug problems during his Navy service and blamed the Navy for failing to treat him for stress and substance abuse.

During 10 months in Afghanistan, Allen worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, “and every day, death was sitting and laying before him,” public defender Timothy O’Hara told the court.

“As one can imagine, he did not return the same way he went,” O’Hara said. “He received a general discharge based on an incident that occurred while he was in the armed forces relating to similar conduct.”

And without treatment, “he’s released to the world with a million problems in his head.”

O’Hara also argued that Allen’s later drug abuse was limited to the hospitals that hired him.

“There is no evidence to suggest,” he said, “that he is using anything other than what he was able to get his hands on as an employee of these institutions.”

The Denver Post,Colorado law does little to protect patients from bad surgical techs,"In the five years Colorado has regulated surgical technologists in its hospitals, Rocky Allen was only the second to get suspended.

Allen, the 28-year-old hospital worker accused of stealing a powerful narcotic drug at Swedish Medical Center, had managed to move from state to state, getting fired by one hospital after another, before Colorado admitted him to work again in its operating rooms.

This happened for two reasons: Colorado is one of a handful of states that regulate surgical technologists at all. And it doesn’t perform background checks to see if applicants are lying about their work or criminal history.

“The way the program is set up,” the Division of Professions and Occupations “doesn’t go about verifying the information they submit,” said Cory Everett, its chief of staff.

After surgery tech Kristen Parker infected at least 18 hospital patients with hepatitis C by stealing painkillers and leaving behind her dirty syringes in 2009, Colorado enacted a law intended to prevent that from happening again.

But the division’s own records show it’s extremely rare for an applicant to get denied or disciplined.

As of June 2015, Colorado had 1,955 active surgical technologists, who help set up operating rooms before surgery, and 627 active surgical assistants, who help doctors during surgery.

No surgical assistant has been disciplined since the law was enacted in 2010.

One surgical technologist was revoked for diverting drugs and working while impaired. Two others voluntarily surrendered their state registrations, one for substance abuse, the other for writing fraudulent prescriptions, a history of drug abuse and a felony drug conviction not disclosed on the application for licensure.

Three have been denied registration: two for a history of DUIs and one who “billed at least $4.4 million to insurance companies and patients and received at least $490,000 through this fraudulent activity in another state.”

Allen was suspended in an order noting that he had tested positive at Swedish for using fentanyl, a painkiller 80 to 100 times as powerful as morphine, and marijuana.

The Colorado law regulating surgical techs and assistants is set to expire this year. A legislative hearing is scheduled this week to consider whether to “sunset” the law, extend it or strengthen it.

At Swedish, about 2,900 people have been offered free blood tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. State and hospital officials have not disclosed whether anyone is infected.

But a federal court hearing Friday disclosed that Allen carries an unnamed bloodborne pathogen. Bloodborne pathogens include, but are not limited to, the same diseases.

Two Arizona hospitals where Allen previously worked also are offering free blood tests.

At the court hearing, a special agent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration testified that a witness at Swedish saw Allen replace a fentanyl syringe with another that contained none of the painkiller.

The agent also testified that Allen was fired by a California hospital after acknowledging that he had stolen a fentanyl syringe and replaced it with saline solution.

James Avery, a lawyer who has been taking Swedish patients as clients, has said a 56-year-old man and 48-year-old woman tested positive for hepatitis.

But the man has received a letter from Swedish that described his condition as “history of natural hepatitis B infection.” The letter also advised, “no follow-up needed,” but recommended “that you discuss the enclosed results with your personal physician.”

Avery said the man plans to be retested by someone other than Swedish.

Swedish has not responded to questions about Avery’s clients from the Denver Post.

Avery’s clients include a woman who says Allen administered fentanyl to her, which would be illegal, and others who experienced extreme pain after surgery.

One was a 9-year-old girl in the burn unit, Avery said.

Another was Rob Brown, a Vietnam War veteran who has undergone 74 surgeries since he was injured by a land mine explosion in 1968.

He wrote to Avery that he suffered excruciating post-surgery pain at Swedish.

“I was in so much pain, pain like I never experienced before including laying blown apart on the battle field,” he wrote. “The first day my wife had to feed me because I couldn’t even move my arms without scream-level pain.”

The Denver Post,Tech accused of risking the health of Swedish Medical Center patients was fired in Ariz. over drugs,"The surgical technologist accused of stealing a powerful narcotic drug and risking the health of patients at a Colorado hospital was fired 17 months ago by an Arizona hospital for a drug-related problem.

HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center, a Phoenix hospital, announced late Saturday that any patient who had surgery while Rocky Allen was employed there can get free blood tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.

Its decision mirrors the action taken by Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, which has offered free blood tests to about 2,900 surgery patients during Allen’s term of employment.

The number of potentially affected patients is much smaller in Phoenix.

“We have identified 97 patients who were in a surgery” from July 28 to Sept. 26, 2014, when Allen worked at John C. Lincoln, the hospital said.

The hospital did not specify the circumstances of Allen’s dismissal there except to say “he was terminated for violation of our workplace policy when he tested positive for use of a controlled substance.”

In Colorado, Swedish terminated Allen, a 28-year-old surgical technologist, after a fellow employee reported seeing him steal fentanyl, a drug used by anesthesiologists, last month.

The Phoenix hospital’s announcement, made one day after a call from The Denver Post, shows Allen was able to find work in a Colorado operating room after a drug-related firing in Arizona.

“As soon as we found out about the Colorado incident and became aware that Allen was our former employee, we immediately began looking into the matter,” the hospital stated. “We are working in close collaboration with the Maricopa County Department of Public Health and the Arizona Department of Health Services.”

The hospital said it has no evidence that any patient had been infected, “but in the interest of patient safety, we’re taking a position of extreme caution.”

It also said it is “conducting a comprehensive review of our policies and procedures related to controlled substances.”

Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director for disease control for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, commended the hospital’s decision.

“The staff and physicians at John C. Lincoln Medical Center are doing the right thing for their patients. They immediately reached out to us about this matter,” she said.

A second hospital in a Phoenix suburb, Banner Thunderbird, confirmed that Allen also worked there in 2014. Hospital spokesman Jeff Nelson described it as a “very short period of time — six weeks” but would not say why Allen left.

“As a health institution, patient safety is paramount, and we certainly understand the gravity of the situation occurring in Colorado. However, as a matter of policy we are unable to comment on employee matters,” he said.

In Colorado, Swedish Medical Center patients who had surgery between Aug. 17, 2015, and this Jan. 22 have been asked to get free blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

Those dates coincide with Allen’s employment at the hospital. He was escorted out of the operating room and later dismissed after the alleged theft of a fentanyl syringe. His registration as a surgical technologist was suspended a week later in a state regulatory order that said he tested positive for fentanyl and marijuana.

The Post called the two Arizona hospitals in response to a tip from an Arizona hospital employee.

Arizona does not regulate surgical technologists, who are trained to assist in operating rooms, and does not keep disciplinary records concerning them.

The Post has been unable to reach Allen for an interview.

Jeff Holeman, a John C. Lincoln hospital spokesman, said that to his knowledge, the hospital was unaware of Allen’s previous employment at Banner Thunderbird.

In Colorado, the Englewood Police Department launched a criminal investigation into Allen’s alleged theft of fentanyl from Swedish but did not file charges.

That investigation has been turned over to two federal agencies, the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Swedish has not said whether Allen disclosed his prior employment in Arizona as a surgical technologist.

Swedish is investigating possible exposures with the state Department of Public Health and Environment and is reaching out to patients.

More than 1,600 people have come for blood tests, but state officials have not disclosed whether anyone is infected.

According to the state Division of Professions and Occupations, Rocky Elbert Allen registered as a surgical technologist license in July. It was summarily suspended Jan. 29.

The suspension order noted that on Jan. 22, “in the beginning stages of a surgical procedure,” Allen “removed a labeled fentanyl syringe” from the anesthesia work space “and replaced the fentanyl syringe with another labeled syringe.”

The Denver Post,Revelry in Rio de Janeiro amid Zika virus crisis,"RIO DE JANEIRO — For the next few nights, Tuane Rocha, a tall, radiant samba queen, will be dancing naked in the streets of this city, wearing only body paint.

Mind you, she will take precautions. “First, I’m going to put on a layer of repellent,” she said. “Then makeup. Then the paint.”

Rocha dances fast — really fast. She figures she can keep the mosquitoes at bay if she keeps moving.

Because nothing stops Carnival in this country. Not the government, nor a lousy economy, nor the Zika pandemic.

Millions of Brazilians will be in the streets this coming week for one of the world’s biggest bacchanals, a dancing and drinking binge that draws revelers from all over the world. No doubt some of them will go home with Zika and spread it even more. Huge crowds at Carnival celebrations across the Americas will give the virus new opportunities to propagate — by mosquito but also potentially through sexual contact.

The arrival of Carnival points to one of the inherent challenges in fighting the Zika outbreak. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a “global emergency.” But it doesn’t quite feel like one. At least not here, despite the terrifying possibility that it is bringing into the world a wave of babies born with small heads.

Pregnant women and their families are petrified. But unlike Ebola, cholera or AIDS at its advent, the Zika virus doesn’t present an immediate, lethal threat to the broader population. As many as 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. And the best — really the only — way to fight it is for people to do something that they should have been doing anyway: eliminating the mosquito breeding pools in their homes and yards.

The mosquitoes that carry Zika flourish, too, in places that belong to no one. Rio de Janeiro’s spectacular urban rain forests and lush mountains teem with them. So do the city’s vacant lots and roadsides, strewn with garbage where water collects. Carnival, which began Friday, will probably bring even more trash.

Just as authorities here have bristled at calls to cancel the Summer Olympics scheduled for August, there was never any question in Brazilian minds that Carnival would go on despite Zika. Canceling it would be similar to the U.S. government trying to cancel Christmas. It is the country’s most sacred holiday, said Brazilian sociologist and columnist Luiz Simas. Its very purpose is to help people forget about their problems.

“People abroad might find this a little strange,” he said. “But in the history of Rio, at the most difficult moments, Carnival is even more intense.”

“You don’t party at Carnival because life is good,” Simas said. “You party at Carnival because life is difficult.”

In addition to its main parade, a massive, corporate-sponsored procession with thousands of dancers gyrating in elaborate costumes, Carnival also consists of hundreds of neighborhood-level street parties known as “blocos,” where the drumming and drinking last long into the hot nights of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. It’s hard to think of a better place for mosquitoes and for promiscuity.

Images of Carnival revelry here may contribute to international perceptions that Brazil isn’t doing enough to contain the outbreak or sound alarms, for fear of losing much-needed tourism revenue for Carnival and the Olympics.

This week, the country’s Health Ministry also fired back at complaints from scientists and researchers in the United States and Europe who say they are unable to properly study Zika because Brazil isn’t sharing enough test samples.

Authorities reject claims that they aren’t taking the pandemic seriously or should cancel the Summer Games. President Dilma Rousseff has urged Brazilians to mobilize against the virus, and she promised expectant mothers that the government “will do everything, absolutely everything in our power to protect you.”

In a speech this past week, Rousseff declared “war” on Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that is the primary vector for the virus. She has ordered more than 220,000 soldiers to fan out across the country to hand out leaflets at 3 million homes. About 50,000 will hunt for pools of standing water where the insects breed.

But not until next week. After Carnival.

“People here expect the government to do a lot for them,” said Leandro do Nascimiento, a city health worker passing out brochures and condoms ahead of Carnival. “We need them to take responsibility for this, too.”

He joined a large group of health and sanitation workers dancing to samba music and passing out condoms and lubricant packets near commuter trains this week.

They do the event every year ahead of the festivities to encourage HIV prevention, but this year, they added Zika materials, and a few dressed up in mosquito costumes, wearing plastic wings and rubbery proboscises.",06/02/2016
The Denver Post,Sexually violent predator takes cyanide after Colorado arrest,"Former college professor Robert Lindsay began sweating profusely and foaming at the mouth while he sat in the back seat of a Golden patrol car.

What caused his death remained a mystery for nearly a month. The Jefferson County coroner’s office didn’t even know the right test to run until Lindsay’s brother, Greg, revealed he had vowed to take cyanide before going back to jail.

Lindsay’s suicide proved traumatic to police officers who witnessed his death and feared possible career repercussions. His case was so bizarre it became a cautionary teaching lesson for U.S. marshals as far away as Maryland.

“He took the same drug the Nazis did to kill themselves,” said Lindsay’s father, William, of Dallas. “He vowed he would never go back to prison. Committing suicide was probably him saying I’m getting away with this and you can’t do a thing about it.”

Cyanide poisoning has long been an escape solution for desperate men. Adolf Hitler took a cyanide pill before shooting himself to death in 1945. In June 2012, Michael Marin, 53, took cyanide after a jury found him guilty of burning down his $3.5 million Phoenix mansion.

Lindsay had shown sparks of brilliance, but too often it was for nefarious reasons, his father said. He earned advanced degrees at Texas A&M, before teaching college courses at an affiliate Texas state college, William Lindsay said. But his achievements were marred by drug abuse, his father said. The professor was fired and moved to Flagstaff, Ariz., where he got a job with the U.S. Postal Service.

In September 1997, Lindsay molested a girl and was sentenced to five years in prison and life on parole. He jumped parole in April 2006.

In 2007, Detective Michael Parker and Sgt. John Reinikka of Montgomery County, Md., found Lindsay using the alias Robert Olson in Silver Spring. When Parker called him by his real name, Lindsay tried to bolt.

“He was kicking and punching and yelling, ‘I can’t go back!’ ” Reinikka said. Reinikka’s little finger was broken and Lindsay bit Parker’s right thumb, drawing blood, while they arrested him.

Upon his release in 2012, he failed to register as a sex offender and fled to Colorado. The HIV-positive child molester made Maryland’s top-10 fugitive list, said Matt Burke, of the U.S. Marshals Service in Maryland.

After three years on the run, federal marshals tracked him down to Gunslinger paint shop in Golden on July 28. Lindsay was paged over an intercom. He climbed out a second-story window, Burke said. By chance, Lindsay ran into Golden police officers on a training exercise, Burke said.

“He didn’t say, ‘Hey, I just took something that may kill me,’ ” Burke said.

At first, doctors thought Lindsay might have had a heart attack, William Lindsay said.

His death was disconcerting to police officers who arrested him, in part because of intense public scrutiny when people die while in custody, said Capt. Joe Harvey of the Golden Police Department.

Dan Pruett, chief deputy coroner for Jefferson County, said the county doesn’t routinely screen for cyanide poisoning during toxicology testing. The autopsy originally didn’t determine a cause of death, according to police records. Much like carbon monoxide poisoning, cyanide blocks oxygenation, Pruett said.

A cyanide screening was ordered after Greg Lindsay called from Texas on Aug. 25. During the call, he said he didn’t know if it was relevant but his brother often boasted about taking cyanide to avoid going back to prison, Pruett said.

When the cyanide test was done in September, it confirmed a lethal concentration of cyanide in Lindsay’s body. Investigators used metal detectors to find a discarded metal container in the parking lot of Gunslinger’s, according to police records.

There were several theories about why Lindsay killed himself and used cyanide to do so.

His father said he had been attacked in prison and that may have affected his decision. But he believes Arizona’s tough sex offender rules including lifetime parole was the biggest reason.

“I guess he just got tired of being jacked around by the judicial system,” William Lindsay said.

Parker, who underwent medical treatments for possible HIV infection for months after Lindsay bit him, said Lindsay had offered another possible clue about his motive to kill himself.

“He was telling me, ‘I’m not going back to jail because it’s a death sentence,’ ” Parker said. He explained that if he went to jail he wouldn’t get the treatment he needed and would certainly die of AIDS, he said.

Lewis Nelson, a professor of toxicology and emergency medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, said cyanide offers a quick and nearly certain death. It is available online, and people can have it delivered by mail, he added.

An investigation cleared officers who arrested Lindsay of any wrongdoing, Harvey said.

The U.S. Marshals’ Service now uses Lindsay’s case as a training exercise for marshals who might otherwise underestimate the danger a fugitive poses, Burke said.

He explains that Lindsay wasn’t facing a lengthy prison term for failure to register as a sex offender.

“This isn’t armed robbery,” he said. “It goes to show that you don’t know what’s going on in that guy’s life. It’s an example of what lengths someone is willing to go when they don’t want to go back to jail.”

The Denver Post,"If I drink coffee before giving blood, will recipients get a buzz?","Dear Science: I gave blood recently after drinking (many cups of) coffee and can’t help but wonder – will any of the recipients of my caffeinated blood feel a caffeine jolt???

A: We hope you’re not exceeding the maximum recommendation of five cups of coffee a day, but something about your choice of punctuation suggests otherwise. Just remember: A serving of coffee contains about 100 mg of caffeine. Consuming more than 500 or 600 mg a day can make you nervous, irritable, twitchy and nauseated, among other things.

The good news is that the recipient of your generous blood donation probably didn’t notice a blood buzz.

“I know of no data that shows that it would have an impact on the recipient,” said Jerome Gottschall, senior medical director of the BloodCenter of Wisconsin.

In fact, to our knowledge, no one has bothered studying this question at all: The researchers we talked to agreed that it was a fun one to talk about, but it just doesn’t rank high on the list of concerns about the safety of the blood supply.

Caffeine, which works its magic by blocking the neuroreceptors for a chemical called adenosine, has a half life of around five hours. That means that while the amount in your system just about drops by half every five hours or so, it takes quite some time – probably about two days – for it to disappear completely. If you give blood in the morning and drink a typical serving of morning joe beforehand, you probably have a good 100 or 200 mg of caffeine still kicking around when you go under the needle.

“Probably lots of donors have caffeine in the morning and donate sometime in the day, and this has gone on forever and ever,” Gottschall said. “And for the most part that has no effect on the donor themselves.”

Alan Mast, a senior investigator for the BloodCenter of Wisconsin and a spokesperson for the American Society of Hematology, agreed.

“To be totally honest, usually when a patient is in the hospital getting a blood transfusion they have a lot of other things going on,” Mast said. If they got a tiny perk from caffeine, they’d be unlikely to notice. They might not even be conscious until it had worn off.

Mast and Gottschall both think that even that tiny, easily-ignored buzz would be rare. It’s a question of dilution: Blood is made up of red blood cells and plasma, but most people who receive transfusions get what we call packed red blood cells. Those super bright red bags of blood you see hooked to IVs in hospitals aren’t just wholesale blood – they’re full of donated blood that’s had the plasma removed, then been mixed with other red blood cells.

It’s the plasma that would carry the caffeine, Mast explained, and there would only be around 20 milliliters of that buzzy blood product diluting into the 5 liters of blood typically found in the human body.

“That’s a very small cup of coffee,” he said.

If someone received a plasma donation from a donor who drank coffee at just the right time, he said, it could potentially cause some kind of noticeable bump in the recipient’s caffeine levels. But because it wouldn’t hurt them – and likely wouldn’t make them feel any perkier, given their current state – it’s unlikely anyone would notice or care. Furthermore, because no one has studied this question, it isn’t clear how the process of preparing donated blood for use – after separation and testing, red blood cells are refrigerated for up to 42 days and plasma can be frozen for a year – might degrade caffeine molecules.

That doesn’t mean you should chug coffee before giving blood.

“It can be a very mild diuretic at times, so that’s probably not a good thing,” Gottschall said. Caffeine makes you pee, which means less liquid in your body. Donating blood means losing even more liquid. Being dehydrated means you might be the guy who passes out on donation day, and no one wants to be that guy.

So caffeine falls firmly in the “who cares” category, as long as you stay well-hydrated. We asked whether any foods a donor might eat could prove problematic, and the answer is a resounding “probably not” (though you should avoid very fatty foods, which can interfere with some of the testing done on blood products, and bulk up on iron-heavy foods for a couple weeks before to avoid being too anemic to give).

“Occasionally patients have an allergic reaction, hives or something, and we don’t know exactly all the time what causes that,” Gottscall said. “Could that be related to a food intake they have an allergy to? We’re not sure, but that’s not really considered when people donate.”

But there are drugs that hematologists take more seriously than caffeine: Medications that cause birth defects, such as certain prostate or acne drugs, are forbidden. There hasn’t been much research on how likely it would be for blood tainted with these drugs to hurt a pregnant woman’s fetus – again, the dilution of the substance would probably make any exposure negligible – but better safe than sorry. Both researchers were cagey when we asked about more recreational drugs. Screening questions and track mark checks are meant to cut drug users from the donation pool, but blood isn’t tested for things such as cocaine or heroin – it would just be too expensive to do so. Dilution should keep any errant illegal substances from posing a real threat, but it goes without saying that donating blood while high is a bad thing to do for many reasons.

And try to avoid aspirin-like painkillers before your donation. These drugs inhibit the function of platelets, the tiny particles that make blood clot. That’s obviously not ideal during a risky surgery.

“You’ll be giving the patient a product that doesn’t work right,” Mast said.

You’ll be waived through aspirin-and-all if you’re just giving whole blood, but you’ll be prohibited from donating via aspheresis, a.k.a. that super cool looking machine that takes your blood, spins it up, and puts some of it back into your body. Clinics use this method to get more of the specific blood products they need on any given day. It’s good practice to make sure you’re capable of providing usable platelets when you go in to give blood, because someone in your region might need them.

Because Denmark and Sweden have nationalized health care and link records between blood donation, medical history and recipient outcomes, scientists now have intriguing data on other blood donor concerns such as cancer and Alzheimer’s.

“People are starting to ask whether, if a person donates blood and is diagnosed with cancer a year later, they might have already been sick and given cancer to the recipient,” Mast said. But Denmark and Sweden’s follow-ups have shown that this doesn’t seem to be a problem. Similarly, those who gave blood all their lives before developing Alzheimer’s did not appear to increase the risk for the syndrome in their recipients.

“The obvious things that we test blood for are HIV and Hepatitis B and C,” Mast said. “Nothing is ever 100 percent, but our testing accuracy is nearing that.” So the likelihood of even these diseases contaminating the blood supply are very, very low.

At the end of the day, what you put into your body before donating has more of an impact on your own health than that of the lucky recipient of your caffeinated or fatty blood. Even rules about fevers and cold symptoms are meant to protect donors, not recipients.

“If a donor is so sick that they have bacteria in their blood, that could be passed on,” Gottschall said. But someone with septicemia is unlikely to get out of bed and mosey down to a blood drive.

“It’s really about the fact that if you have a fever, you know, you’re sweating, you’re not feeling well, you’re dehydrated,” he said. “You want the donor to be feeling healthy on the day of the draw, no question.”",17/07/2016
The Denver Post,Black activists hope killings prompt more action from whites,"NEW YORK — Since the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement three years ago, many white Americans have wrestled with how to respond. Some chose racist-tinged ridicule. Others, by word or deed, sought to show solidarity as blacks protested the deaths of fellow blacks in encounters with police. Still others, untouched personally, watched from a distance in silence.

This past week, as graphic videos portrayed two more such deaths and five police officers were slain at a march in Dallas protesting the killings, whites have joined blacks in forceful calls for unity that cut across color lines. Some see hope of a turning point from these tragedies, that this might be the eyes-wide-open moment that moves white America from apathy or remorse to action in pursuit of racial reconciliation.

“I definitely think there’s a change in the atmosphere,” said Johnetta Elzie, a black activist from St. Louis who believes the events have galvanized more white people to confront issues that afflict blacks. “I hate the fact that it is this way, but with every police violence victim story that goes national, more and more people wake up.”

The Black Lives Matter movement began in 2013, inspired to a large degree by the killing the previous year of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. It soon grew into both a national battle cry and phenomenon after a series of killings of blacks and other minorities by police.

Over the course of the campaign, black activists have had mixed feelings about the response from whites — commending those who have supported the effort yet decrying what they perceive as disinterest or hostility from a majority of whites.

“Yes, White people are standing with us in response to these killings and we value that, but we need more Whites to tackle the systemic racism and discrimination that Blacks are subjected to,” San Francisco activist Javarre Wilson said in an email response to questions. “White people don’t have to worry whether their child will be at the receiving end of a cop’s baton or handgun. White people don’t have to worry about whether they will be pulled over in their cars and aggressively harassed by racist cops.”

To be sure, whites, Latinos, Asians and others have joined black Americans in decrying the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, made all the more palpable because videos capturing the incidents were widely shared for all to see on social media and across the Internet. The officers involved were placed on leave and investigations continue.

“My heart is in a million pieces,” Rachel Hockett, a white theater director in Ithaca, New York, wrote in a Facebook post. “I can’t even begin to imagine how it feels to be African-American in this country. But I certainly care, to my toes, and I know how I would feel if my son or daughter were gunned down in this way.”

“All #blacklivesmatter. Unconditionally,” Nellie Fitzpatrick, director of Philadelphia’s Office of LGBT Affairs, declared on her Facebook page.

But words are not enough, in the view of many black activists. They argue that most whites have been too slow to speak out when injustices occur and that, once they do, such expressions rarely equate to meaningful change.

“It makes the killings worse to know that your disapproval of them has spared your reputations and not our lives,” Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown University, wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times after the deaths of Sterling and Castile. He addressed his piece to “white America.”

“You will never understand the helplessness we feel in watching these events unfold, violently, time and again, as shaky images tell a story more sobering than your eyes are willing to believe: that black life can mean so little,” Dyson wrote. “You do not know that after we get angry with you, we get even angrier with ourselves, because we don’t know how to make you stop, or how to make you care enough to stop those who pull the triggers.”

Matthew Shaw, a black law and public policy analyst at the American Bar Foundation, said too many white Americans lack empathy with blacks, and need to find ways to develop that.

“If you see someone being shot while sitting in a car with his family, and you don’t have some empathy, you’ve got some work to do,” he said in reference to Castile’s death. “Work on your friends, your family, people in your neighborhood.”

He urged whites to get active in campaigns to improve police practices and promote racial justice.

“Violence is the worst response,” he said. “Throwing your hands in the air and saying nothing can be done is a close second.”

Some whites have indeed taken steps to build support for the Black Lives Matter movement among their fellow whites, and they say they are making progress.

Dara Silverman is the national coordinator of Showing Up for Racial Justice, a network launched a year and a half ago. She said it has grown from a dozen local groups to more than 150, expanding the base of whites committed to fighting racial inequality.

The network encourages white activists to hold house parties and conduct door-to-door canvassing in an effort to attract more supporters. A statement issued after the deaths of Sterling and Castile also urged direct protest action.

“Join us in the streets,” it said. “Now is the time for white people to be visible, courageous and relentless in our public opposition to racism and the state-sanctioned murder of Black people.”

Many white politicians, including top Democratic and Republican leaders, appealed for tolerance and unity in the aftermath of the deadly incidents. Hillary Clinton, in an interview with CNN, called on white people “to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families who fear every time their children go somewhere.” House Speaker Paul Ryan implored Americans to “not lose sight of the values that unite us, our common humanity.”

There were harsh comments as well. Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, tweeted in response to the slayings of the officers in Dallas by a black Army veteran: “This is now war” and “Watch out black lives matter punks.” The perpetrator, who was killed during an ensuing standoff with authorities, told officials he was upset about the police killings of Sterling and Castile and wanted to exterminate whites. He said he acted alone and not in concert with any groups.

Diana Bass, an author who specializes in American religion and culture, urged white people to speak out against racism — even if seen in those closest to them.

“With the exception of my mother and her father, I knew no adult who ever said anything good about any black person,” she recalled of her childhood years in a Facebook post. “I disavow their beliefs. I utterly, completely reject their racism. They were wrong and used race to keep others down in order to try and protect their own fragile egos and privilege.”

The Rev. Russell Moore, a white evangelical who heads the Southern Baptist Convention’s public policy agency, wrote an essay on his personal website that put the latest incidents into historical perspective — making references to slavery and to the era of segregation in which his denomination resisted black civil rights.

“African-Americans have lived with trauma from the very beginning, the initial trauma being the kidnapping and forced enslavement of an entire people with no standing whatsoever before the law,” he wrote. “For the black community, these present situations often reverberate with a history of state-sanctioned violence, in a way that many white Americans – including white evangelicals – often don’t understand.”

Moore’s essay ended on a note of hope: “We can work for justice in the public arena as we learn to love one another in the personal arena, and vice versa.”

But there also were voices of despair.

“It’s overwhelming to see what we are up against, to live in a world where too many people have their fingers on the triggers of guns aimed directly at black people,” Peter Staley, a white AIDS/HIV activist in New York City, wrote on his Facebook page.

“I don’t know what to do anymore,” he said. “I don’t know how to believe change is possible when there is so much evidence to the contrary.”",10/07/2016
The Denver Post,Is the push for marijuana legalization reaching critical mass in the United States?,"By Alicia Wallace, The Cannabist Staff

It’s a pivotal moment for marijuana in the United States.

Come Tuesday, voters in five states — Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada — will decide whether to legalize the recreational use of cannabis; and residents in four other states — Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota — will weigh medical marijuana measures.

“It’s hard to imagine that all nine ballot initiatives fail,” said John Hudak, a marijuana policy expert and author.

And while a clean sweep also appears unlikely, the more states adopting marijuana laws — especially the economic force of the populous California — could push the needle a little further in the direction of broad-scale federal legalization, said Hudak, who serves as a senior fellow in governance studies for the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.

“The size of the California market coming online and being legal is going to be fairly significant,” he said. “The economic implications are tremendous, and certainly there will be political implications.”

If Proposition 64 passes, members of Congress also may very well look at the state and chalk it up to California being California, and that the state is regulating what was already happening in a gray market capacity, he said.

“I think on its own and in and of itself, California is not that gamechanger,” he said.

However, the ease at which the California legal market is formed and developed could carry some greater weight, he added.

A move by California to legalize the recreational use of marijuana has been considered by some as a potential “watershed moment” for the cannabis industry.

If Proposition 64 passes and is implemented by 2018, California could have a $6.5 billion marijuana market in 2020 — accounting for nearly a third of the estimated 2020 sales for the entire U.S. cannabis industry, according to market research reports from the Arcview Group and New Frontier Data.

As it stands now, the industry is projected to tally $7.4 billion in revenue this year. Half of the U.S. states have medical marijuana laws in place and several others have adopted the use of low-THC cannabis oil for limited medical purposes. On the recreational side, Colorado, the first to allow legal sales of adult-use cannabis, now has company in Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C.

Public support of marijuana legalization also is at its highest-ever levels, according to recent polls by Pew Research Center and Gallup. The bulk of the support is coming from the younger generations, Pew’s survey showed.

Some marijuana measures up for vote have been trending favorably; but others, such as the medical marijuana proposal in Arkansas, are likely to come down to the wire. The measures have been heavily contested.

And even if some or all of the marijuana measures are successful on Tuesday, Hudak said that he’s “not convinced we’re at that critical mass.”

“We have had very little federal-level medical marijuana reform,” he said.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration stood pat on keeping marijuana a Schedule I substance on the Controlled Substances Act — in the same category as heroin and LSD — while easing some restrictions for research on the cannabis plant.

Other policy experts say the success of the 2016 marijuana measures could potentially spur action at the nation’s highest office.

“If you’re sitting in the White House, you have to say, ‘Gosh, that might be enough,’ ” said Mark Kleiman, professor of public policy at New York University’s Marron Institute of Urban Management.

Federal legalization likely won’t happen with a flip of the switch, but the increased adoption of these laws could spur increased dialogue on banking- and tax-related issues that have dogged the industry, he said.

The two leading presidential candidates have both said they support marijuana legalization from a states’ rights perspective. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has committed to rescheduling marijuana to Schedule II, and Republican nominee Donald Trump appears to be hands-off on this topic, but some of the rhetoric around substance abuse “would lead you to believe he’s certainly not going to be a reformer,” Hudak said.

The biggest concern for the marijuana industry would be the possible appointment of Chris Christie as U.S. Attorney General, Hudak said, referencing the New Jersey governor who has been a staunch critic of legalization.

“I think there’s a much bigger risk of federal intervention,” Hudak said.

Marijuana on the ballot in 2016

Recreational measures

ARIZONA: Proposition 205 would allow adults 21 and older to carry up to an ounce, grow up to six plants and consume marijuana in non-public spaces. Retail marijuana sales would have a 15 percent tax imposed. Retail shops would not open until at least 2018.

CALIFORNIA: The passage of Proposition 64, a.k.a. the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to an ounce of cannabis, purchase dried flower and cannabis products from licensed retailers and grow up to six plants for personal use. Among the provisions of the 62-page initiative are an allowance for local government regulations, bans and taxes; proposed state tax of 15 percent on retail sales and separate taxes for cultivation; and restrictions on where cannabis can be consumed.

MAINE: With Question 1, voters will decide whether to allow marijuana possession and sales for adults 21 and older, who could also grow up to six plants. The proposal includes a 10 percent retail sales tax. The initiative has prohibitions on places of consumption, including restricting use to a private residence, and it allows municipalities to regulate the number of retail stores or ban them entirely.

MASSACHUSETTS: Under the Question 4 measure, adults 21 and older can possess up to an ounce of pot, keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home and grow up to six plants. Marijuana sold in licensed shops would be subject to an excise tax of 3.75 percent in addition to Massachusetts’ 6.25 percent state sales tax. The initiative allows for the creation of a 15-member cannabis advisory board to study and make recommendations on regulations and marijuana products.

NEVADA: The Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, or Question 2, would make it legal for adults age 21 and older to buy marijuana for recreational use, possess up to an ounce and grow up to six plants at home — if that residence is more than 25 miles away from a licensed dispensary. The initiative includes some limitations on the number of retail outlets in a specific county — the populous Clark County, home to Las Vegas, can have up to 80 shops, while every other county under 55,000 people can have no more than two recreational stores. Wholesale marijuana would be subject to a 15 percent excise tax. Cannabis consumption would be restricted to private premises, which could include a retail marijuana store.

Medical measures

ARKANSAS: If approved by voters, the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment (Issue 6), is a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow an independent commission to award licenses for up to eight grow facilities and up to 40 for-profit dispensaries statewide. Home growing is not allowed. There were initially two medical marijuana measures on the ballot, but one failed a legal challenge that went to the state’s highest court and its votes will not be counted.

FLORIDA: Under the Amendment 2 proposal, the state Department of Health would register and regulate dispensaries as well as issue ID cards to patients and caregivers. Individuals with medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, PTSD and Crohn’s would have to receive approval from a licensed Florida physician to be eligible for medical marijuana. The amendment requires parental consent for minors. A successful constitutional amendment in Florida requires at least 60 percent approval to pass. Two years ago, a medical marijuana measure also on the ballot as Amendment 2 fell 2.4 percent shy of that threshold.

MONTANA: The state program, approved by voters in 2004, has been in flux this year amid a court battle. In February, the Montana Supreme Court upheld 2011 state laws limiting medical marijuana providers to three patients apiece; the law went into effect Aug. 31. Initiative 182 was filed as a means of expanding legal access to medical marijuana. The proposed initiative would repeal the three-patient limit and other requirements such as unannounced inspections and required reviews for physicians who provide certifications. The qualifying conditions under this initiative would include chronic pain and PTSD.

NORTH DAKOTA: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5, a.k.a. The North Dakota Compassionate Care Act, would allow for the possession of up to 3 ounces of marijuana for qualifying conditions such as AIDS, cancer, epilepsy and glaucoma. The proposal allows for people who live more than 40 miles from a licensed dispensary to grow up to eight plants.

The Denver Post,Judge doesn’t make Aurora sex trafficking suspect surrender passport,"CENTENNIAL — A judge denied a prosecutor’s request Monday that a 48-year-old man accused of sex trafficking teen boys out of an upscale Aurora home be made to surrender his passport.

Judge John Scipione also ruled that earlier stipulations mandating Sean Travis Crumpler be barred from Internet use be dropped, but that Crumpler use computers only for work. Crumpler’s attorney argued his client needs the Web to operate his information technology business.

“It’s in your best interest to limit your computer usage,” Scipione said during a morning court hearing.

Crumpler faces 12 counts, including charges of child sex trafficking and child sex assault, in the case. He allegedly told one of his teen victims, according to an arrest affidavit, that he finds “young boys to bring back to the house” and that he calls his efforts “hunting.”

Cara Morlan, the Arapahoe County prosecutor handling the case, said authorities believe Crumpler, whom she called “a computer expert,” owns a motel in Thailand, arguing that he should be closely monitored because of his international ties. Morlan said Crumpler also has homes in the Los Angeles area and near Denver.

“We do believe it’s a public safety danger for him to be granted Internet access,” Moran said.

Authorities allege Crumpler used social media and the Internet to lure boys and then manage his trafficking operation.

A member of FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force in Denver, which investigated the case, said Crumpler’s arrest and his alleged crimes are ” extremely unusual.”

Crumpler and his attorney declined to comment as they left court.

During Monday’s hearing it also surfaced that the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, where Crumpler surrendered after a warrant was issued for his arrest, accidentally released him without Crumpler making a required court appearance.

“As a result we will be reviewing our procedures and making the proper changes to ensure that this does not happen again,” said Mark Techmeyer, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office.

The Denver Post found Crumpler owns an elusive Los Angeles-area information technology firm that claims to specialize in helping primary care physicians operate their practices, according to his LinkedIn account and an employee.

His company, Centernix, is listed out of an apparent virtual office space and was registered in California in 2007. A contractor who answered Centernix’s phone last week said he was unaware of Crumpler’s arrest.

Crumpler is free after posting a $100,000 bond. He is next due in court Nov. 23 for a preliminary hearing.

Two 16-year-old boys were living at Crumpler’s rented southeast Aurora home along with about a dozen men between 18 and 21, according to the affidavit.

New arrivals would “earn” housing and food through “sex,” the document said.

A 21-year-old man who lived at the home told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” The man also said Crumpler, a registered sex offender, was HIV-positive and had unprotected sex with those living in the house.",28/09/2015
The Denver Post,"A year into the presidency, Melania Trump raises her profile","WASHINGTON — Donald and Melania Trump’s remarkably separate daily routines begin with him getting up around 5:30 a.m., watching cable news shows and tweeting.

The first lady wakes in her own bedroom a bit later, according to two close friends of the Trumps. She then readies their 12-year-old son for school, including checking to make sure his homework is in his backpack.

Amid the noise and churn of the Trump administration — most recently about how the president paid money to silence Stormy Daniels — Melania Trump has settled into a quieter routine, often apart from the president, raising their son and carving out a place for herself in a most untraditional White House.

The first lady has not directly addressed the affairs that Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, said they had with her husband. But she has noticeably begun to raise her profile, independent from the president’s, and she has called a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, a public appearance that would have been almost unthinkable just a few months ago.

“Her focus all along has been children and this launch is meant to formalize what her role will be for the next three to seven years,” said Stephanie Grisham, Melania’s spokeswoman. She said the first lady will devote the rest of the Trump presidency to the issues children face today and their well-being.

In recent weeks, the first lady has been at the center of more high-profile events than during the entire previous year — including attending the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush solo.

Political marriages tend to be more complicated than most, but it’s striking that the Trumps make so little effort to project a more united front. Although both are keenly aware of the power of visual images, some of their memorable moments together are awkward: Melania swatting his hand away on a tarmac, and several times caught on camera seeming to resist his outreach.

“She is a dignified, private person, and she’ll deal with her personal life in private and it’s no one’s business,” said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a longtime friend of Melania’s. “They are not that couple that holds hands just because; she is old-world European and it’s not who she is.”

It is unusual to see a candid shot of the president enjoying an unplanned moment with his wife, or even with Barron, the first young son in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1960s.

The Trumps are often apart even during their free time, according to several people who know the couple’s schedules. At Mar-a-Lago on holidays and weekends, the president golfs or dines with politicians, business executives and media personalities on the patio, while Melania is often nowhere to be seen. According to several current and former aides, the president and first lady often do not eat together in the White House either.

“They spend very little to no time together,” said one longtime friend of the president.

Grisham said the president and Melania do spend time with each other. “Aside from the president’s solo trips, the family spends most evenings together.” She also played down the headlines about Trump’s alleged affairs and said Melania “is focused on being a mom. She’s focused on being a wife, and she’s focused on her role as first lady. And that’s it. The rest is just noise.”

A senior West Wing official, when asked about the couple’s separate schedules and bedrooms, declined to comment, saying it wasn’t official business.

Melania grants few interviews and declined to speak for this article, but during the campaign she told The Washington Post that she and her husband are “very independent,” adding, “We give ourselves and each other space.”

According to several people who know the couple, that space appears to have grown wider under the White House roof — especially since Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, as well as Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, publicly talked about their alleged affairs with Trump during his marriage to Melania. Daniels was paid $130,000 during the campaign by a Trump attorney to stop talking about the affair.

Last week, Trump tweeted that he repaid the attorney to “stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.” Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, told NBC News that payment was made “to prevent personal embarrassment and heartache to (Trump’s) wife.”

Another awkward exchange happened April 26 with Trump calling into “Fox & Friends,” announcing that it was Melania’s birthday, and then suddenly talking about Daniels. Asked on the same TV show what he had gotten Melania for her birthday, he paused: “Maybe, I didn’t get her so much. I got her a beautiful card, you know I’m very busy to be running out looking for presents.”

According to several White House staff members, Melania has erected a de facto wall between the East Wing, where she is renovating her office and enjoying growing popularity, and the West Wing, where her husband and Ivanka Trump, her eldest stepdaughter, have offices.

While she goes to the West Wing for official duties, she does not walk down the hall, pop her head in and see how the president’s day is going.

“She seldom sets foot in the West Wing,” said one person with first-hand knowledge.

Yet, many political analysts believe that Trump will need Melania at his side if he wants to win again in 2020.

The Trumps have broken the traditional mold of a presidential family from the moment he was sworn in. While Melania stood beside the president at the Capitol, his two ex-wives, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples, sat in the crowd.

Trump is the only president to be married three times. Melania is 48, and the president is 71.

Rather than move into the White House with her husband, Melania stayed in New York for six months to allow Barron to finish his school year there. That delay initially put Melania at a disadvantage, according to a friend who said the rhythm of the White House had already been established, and left her out of the mix. Some staff positions from the first lady’s office were diverted to the West Wing — including to support Ivanka, who is a presidential adviser, according to a person close to the first lady.

Ivanka, 36, and Melania, both former models, do not have a close relationship and are very different from one another, several people who know them both said. Grisham said it was not only wrong to say Melania was not close to her stepdaughter but “hurtful.”

Noticeably, Melania’s presence is growing as Ivanka’s fades.

Last year, an official White House statement described Ivanka as holding an “unprecedented role for a first daughter” and she has at times taken on the duties of a first lady. Ivanka acts as the president’s policy adviser, has traveled the globe as her father’s surrogate, and sat down with world leaders at the White House. But recently her public profile has been reduced.

First ladies often have had considerable influence, as an informal adviser to the president and the person closest to him. They have been the hidden hand in policy decisions and hiring and firings. And, they can command attention for causes. Most recently, Laura Bush established the National Book Festival and used her foreign trips to focus concern on HIV/AIDS, and Michelle Obama promoted girls’ education globally and started a movement here to get children exercising and eating healthier.

Melania’s staff is unusually small; with 10 people, it is about half the size of Michelle Obama’s at its peak.

Melania has borrowed books from the White House Historical Association to study the first lady’s role and plans to outline on Monday a new initiative about children.

Several polls have shown that as she becomes more visible, her popularity is rising. In many ways the image she projects is the least like Trump’s of all the Trumps.

The president organizes big rallies; Melania often holds meetings with just a few people. Her husband rails against family-based “chain migration”; she is from Slovenia and now her parents, also immigrants, have become legal resident here, too.

The president mocks political enemies on Twitter with his derogatory nicknames such as “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer” or “Cheatin’ Obama”; Melania calls cyberbullying an “evil” and organized a White House conference to try to stop it.

Melania has complained that she doesn’t deserve the mean comments she has read about herself online. She has been heard saying that she knows her husband has contributed to the combative nature of today’s online chatter, and one associate said she has persisted with her anti-cyberbullying efforts despite White House advice that she pick any other issue to champion.

In March, Melania invited top executives from Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies, along with nonprofits working on Internet safety, to the White House to hold a meeting on the issue.

“I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,” she told the group. “I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me for doing what I know is right,” she said in opening remarks. “We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.”

Stephen Balkam, the founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute, was seated at a table with the first lady. “It was a pretty remarkable opening,” he said. “I was pleased that she addressed the elephant in the room.”

Melania has not always been willing to go in a different direction from her husband. In 2011, when Trump was one of the leading “birthers” challenging the validity of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate and U.S. citizenship, Melania backed him up.

“What’s this with the birth certificate obsession? Did he ask to see yours when you met him?” asked TV interviewer Joy Behar.

“Do you want to see President Obama’s birth certificate or not?” Melania responded. She also said what Obama had made public to date was “different” from a birth certificate. “It would be very easy if President Obama would just show it,” she said.

“It is not only Donald who wants to see it. It’s the American people … they want to see that.”

But as first lady, she has publicly praised Michelle Obama and laughed alongside President Obama, who sat beside her at Barbara Bush’s funeral last month in Houston. She also shared the pew with Bill and Hillary Clinton — two favorite targets of her husband’s criticism.

Melania received a warm reception from the former presidents and first ladies. Photos of them all together — the Obamas, the Clintons, George W. Bush, Laura Bush and George H.W. Bush — show Melania beaming.

She has also traveled apart from her husband — even when they are going to the same destination. In February, hours after the New Yorker published a story about Trump’s alleged affair with McDougal, the Playboy model, Melania did not walk with Trump across the White House’s South Lawn to board Marine One.

Both Trumps were heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, but instead of making the very public walk across the White House lawn with her husband to the helicopter, she drove separately to the Maryland military airport to catch Air Force One. Grisham told reporters at the time that given the first lady’s schedule, it was just easier for the couple to meet at the plane. When her motorcade pulled up, White House press aides shouted at journalists to get off the plane until she boarded. No photos were allowed of her arrival.

As first ladies often are, Melania is more popular than her husband. But two friends of the couple say the president, who pays close attention to his poll numbers, also fixates on hers. Her approval rating was 47 percent to his 40 percent in a January CNN poll.

Grisham said Melania takes her role seriously and is careful to coordinate with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. “Basically, we’re like, ‘OK, we’ll put this out,’ or, ‘We’ll wait for you.’ … We don’t want to conflict with the president’s message of the day, nor do we want him to do that to us.”

But, she added, “the 24/7 social media-cable news cycle and a West Wing that’s very active … perhaps overshadows some of the good work she’s doing.”

Trump described Melania to supporters in a recent email as his “rock and foundation.” “I wouldn’t be the man I am today without her by my side,” he said. “My BEAUTIFUL, kindhearted and exceptional wife.”

“They have an unspoken affinity,” said Winston Wolkoff, whose official advisory arrangement in the first lady’s office ended earlier this year amid headlines about inauguration spending and the White House’s move to end informal contracts.

Another person close to the president said they had heard him call Melania when he travels and “she is someone he relies on and listens to.”

Melania has said she sometimes offers advice to her husband — including about his tweets — but that doesn’t mean he takes it.

During one dinner in the White House in late 2017, Melania told the president that he should be more concerned about the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and that his legal team wasn’t protecting him, according to a person who attended the dinner. Trump disagreed, this person said, insisting that the investigation was going to exonerate him and that he had great lawyers. Grisham disputed this account, saying: “Your anonymous sources are wrong.” Since that dinner, two of three lawyers have left Trump’s Russia team.

Several people in the White House, who like others interviewed for this story did not want to be quoted by name discussing the first couple’s relationship, said Melania does not trust some members of her husband’s staff. Two people in a position to know said she particularly disliked former chief strategist Steve Bannon and told her husband so, and she was upset about the abrupt dismissal of John McEntee, Trump’s young personal assistant. He left over a security clearance issue but is now working on Trump’s reelection effort.

Trump insisted on a prenuptial agreement when he married Melania 13 years ago, just as he had with his two previous wives. The terms have never been made public. A person close to Melania noted that the prenuptial was signed before his political career, which forced her to take on a whole new role and one, as a friend said, that is “unpaid.”

“Free Melania!” continues to be a popular meme. Late-night TV comedy skits portray her as trapped inside the White House, unhappy.

For months, a persistent rumor has floated around Washington that Melania doesn’t really live in the White House and stays in a house with her parents and Barron near his suburban Washington school.

“It’s 1,000 percent false. We laugh at it all the time,” Grisham said.

“It’s an urban legend,” said Rickie Niceta Lloyd, the White House social secretary.

Melania is exceedingly close to her parents and her son, Barron, who also speaks Slovenian with his grandparents. When she is out of the public eye, she is often with her family, friends say.

Her office declined to say where her parents live, or even whether they keep a room at the White House, as Michelle Obama’s mother did.

Melania does spend a lot of time in the White House, according to people who work there, and has a very good relationship with the permanent household staff of nearly 100 that includes chefs, florists and butlers, and she oversees the residence as well as the state floor.

Friends say she is a perfectionist who oversees the tiniest details of events in which she is involved.

She enjoys putting her personal mark on the historic home and has redesigned the family living quarters. While her husband favors the lavish gold-and-glitz decor of their Trump Tower penthouse, Melania has picked neutral colors.

“It is a very comfortable and calming place to be in,” Winston Wolkoff said.

Still, Trump often waves friends up to the residence after holiday parties or social gatherings and gives tours of the Lincoln Bedroom, where he remarks on how tall the former president was while showing off the Gettysburg Address and other features of the home. Melania has, however, told confidantes she wants to keep the residence private.

Although English is not her first language, she is getting more used to public speaking. She has also begun releasing videos of her work.

The latest highly produced video shows her preparing for the recent state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron and has been viewed by nearly 1.5 million people.

Twenty-two years after first coming to the United States to model, she is now one of the most-photographed women in the world.

Paolo Zampolli, who helped arrange for Melania to work in the U.S. fashion industry and sees her in the White House, said Melania is blossoming.

“It’s an incredible story. It’s the American Dream,” said Zampolli. “She really will become the queen of people’s hearts, like Princess Diana was. I think the world will be seeing more of her.”",06/05/2018
The Denver Post,"Barbara Bush, matriarch of American political dynasty, dies at 92","By Lois Romano, The Washington Post

Barbara Bush, who was the wife of one president and the mother of another and whose embrace of her image as America’s warmhearted grandmother belied her influence and mettle, died April 17. She was 92.

The office of her husband, former president George H.W. Bush, issued a statement Tuesday evening announcing her death but did not disclose the cause. Mrs. Bush was reportedly battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Her family announced two days earlier that she had “decided not to seek additional medical treatment” after recent hospitalizations amid her “failing health.”

As the matriarch of one of America’s political dynasties, Bush spent a half century in the public eye. She was portrayed as the consummate wife and homemaker as her husband rose from Texas oilman to commander in chief. They had six children, the eldest of whom, George W. Bush, became president. Their eldest daughter, Robin, died at age 3 of leukemia, a tragedy that had a profound impact on the family.

Her husband served two terms as vice president under Ronald Reagan and then one as president, from 1989 to 1993. On his watch, the Cold War ended, and the nation and its allies achieved a swift and crushing victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War – before a faltering economy largely doomed his reelection prospects.

George W. Bush, a former governor of Texas, was president from 2001 to 2009, and after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he led the country into long-lasting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the rumblings of the Great Recession.

Only Abigail Adams, whose husband, John Adams, and son John Quincy Adams served as the second and sixth presidents, respectively, of the United States, shared Mrs. Bush’s distinction of being the wife and mother of commanders in chief.

Another Bush son, Jeb, served two terms as Florida governor before unsuccessfully seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2016.

Mrs. Bush was proud of her family’s achievements but expressed reservations – especially as Jeb Bush mounted his White House bid – about whether it was healthy in a democracy for one family to accumulate so much power.

In a “Today” show interview, she called Jeb Bush “by far the best-qualified man.” But “there are a lot of great families, and it’s not just four families or whatever. There are other people out there that are very qualified,” she remarked, adding – with her characteristic bluntness – that “we’ve had enough Bushes.”

But once her son entered the race, she was 100 percent in – and she did not mince words about her distaste for his primary opponent, businessman Donald Trump. In a joint interview with Jeb before the New Hampshire primary, she unflinchingly stated that it was “incomprehensible” to her that anyone would vote for Trump, particularly women in light of his abusive comments about them.

Instinctively understanding how Trump’s apparent fondness for Russian leader Vladimir Putin might not sit well with voters, she further noted: “Putin has endorsed him, for heaven’s sakes. Putin the killer, Putin the worst. That’s an endorsement you don’t want.”

A relatively unknown national figure until her husband became vice president, Mrs. Bush was comfortable as a backstage force, maintaining stability during her family’s more than two dozen moves before entering the vice president’s official residence in 1981.

Within the Bush clan, she was known as “the enforcer.”

“She may be a lot of people’s grandmother,” Jeb Bush told Newsday in 1990 when asked about his mother’s soothing, even matronly persona as first lady, “but she was our drill sergeant when we were growing up.”

By her account, she had evolved from a shy, socially “square” 16-year-old schoolgirl smitten at the sight of her 17-year-old future husband at a Christmas dance in Greenwich, Connecticut. At 19, she left her elite women’scollege – Smith – to marry him.

Within a few years, they would leave behind their lives of wealth and privilege in the Northeast as George H.W. Bush sought his fortune as a Texas oilman before winning a congressional seat in 1966. Mrs. Bush accompanied him across the country and around the world as he served as U.N. ambassador, leader of the Republican National Committee, U.S. envoy to China and director of the CIA before becoming Reagan’s running mate.

According to Peter and Rochelle Schweizer’s 2004 book, “The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty,” Barbara Bush for years maintained and meticulously curated a network of tens of thousands of contacts and friends that she saved on index cards for social and fund-raising reasons. By the time the Bushes got to the White House and automated the card file, they had a Christmas card list in excess of 10,000 names.

A different type of political spouse

As a political spouse, she contrasted sharply with her predecessor as first lady, Nancy Reagan, who had at times generated unwanted attention with her lavish spending, designer clothes and intrusions into her husband’s administration. Mrs. Bush presented herself as the antithesis of glamour and excess. She endeared herself to many with her droll frankness, boasting about her trademark triple-strand faux pearls and joking about her prematurely white hair.

The two wives were formidable women, protective of their husbands, and their relationship during the Reagan administration was noticeably icy. The Bushes were seldom invited to the Reagan White House’s family quarters.

As first lady, Mrs. Bush established the nonprofit Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, to which she donated nearly $800,000 in after-tax proceeds from her best-selling “Millie’s Book” (1990), which channeled the voice of her White House pet dog.

She also encouraged people to volunteer at homeless shelters and Head Start projects, and she promoted AIDS awareness when the disease was still highly stigmatized and misunderstood.

In 1989, she made front-page headlines when she visited Grandma’s House, a pediatric AIDS care center in the District, and cradled an infant patient at a time when many people mistakenly believed the disease could be contracted through mere proximity to the virus.

She attended in 1990 the funeral of Ryan White, the teenager who had fought to return to public school in Indiana after he contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion. (Her husband signed into law what is now the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to help provide services for people with the disease, but AIDS advocates have regarded the program as inadequately funded for years.)

Mrs. Bush sat on the board of the historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta and was reported to have played a role in the selection of her friend Louis Sullivan, the president of Morehouse’s medical school, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

Despite her preferences for staying behind the scenes, Mrs. Bush wasn’t shy about expressing her own views. At times, Mrs. Bush made public statements that seemed to conflict with her husband’s policies, including his opposition to abortion rights and gun-control measures. But she adamantly resisted being pulled into discussions about personal and controversial topics, dispatching unwanted questions with salty humor or a sharp, “Next question.”

In a rare misstep while joking with reporters, she referred to Geraldine Ferraro, her husband’s vice-presidential opponent in 1984, as “that $4 million – I can’t say it, but it rhymes with ‘rich.’ ” She quickly apologized.

The White House staff adopted a nickname bestowed on her by her children – the “Silver Fox” – and took care not to cross her. She was known to stare down aides she thought were not performing up to task for her husband.

In one incident, Mrs. Bush put Craig Fuller, chief of staff to then-Vice President Bush, on notice after friends and supporters complained that he was not returning their calls. As she watched him sift through a stack of messages, she snapped, within her husband’s earshot, “Keep looking. . . . You’ll find a couple from me.”

During four years as first lady, Mrs. Bush consistently ranked among the nation’s most-admired women, with high poll numbers that contrasted with her husband’s tumbling ratings. During the 1992 election, she was often deployed by the Bush campaign as a surrogate to humanize a president not known for charisma or the common touch.

She was, many commentators agreed, his most valuable asset in a race against then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, an agile campaigner who pounded Bush on the economy, and wild card candidate Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire running as an independent.

Mrs. Bush generally managed to avoid the sorts of intrigues and uproars that perturbed her predecessor as first lady and her eventual successor, Hillary Clinton, a lawyer and activist, who promised to be a partner in her husband’s public life and memorably defended her career by remarking, “I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas.”

In her no-nonsense way, Mrs. Bush rejected the idea of the election being a referendum on dramatic generational change and pushed back against polls that said she was better liked by the electorate than her husband.

“Nobody is jealous of me,” she told The Washington Post. “I mean, look at me. Who would be? It’s easy to like me. They like George, and they respect him. But he has to say no to people because he has to do what’s right for the country, and that’s hard.”

She met George H.W. Bush while at boarding school

Barbara Pierce was born in New York City on June 8, 1925, and raised in the tony suburb of Rye, New York. She was one of four children of the former Pauline Robinson, the daughter of an Ohio Supreme Court justice, and Marvin Pierce, a top executive of McCall Corp., which published Redbook and McCall’s magazines.

As a child, Barbara stood out physically, having reached 5 foot 8 and 148 pounds by age 12. She once described her younger self as “a very happy, fat child who spent all my life with my mother saying, ‘Eat up, Martha,’ to my older sister and, ‘Not you, Barbara.’ ” She would later talk about her mother as a humorless, unapproachable taskmaster.

She was 16 and a student at the private Ashley Hall school in Charleston, South Carolina, when she met George Herbert Walker Bush, who was then attending the private Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. A romance was sparked at the 1941 Christmas dance and continued mostly through letters.

She later called him her first love and said he was the only boy she ever kissed. She entered Smith College in 1943, but, as she told United Press International years later, “didn’t like to study very much. . . . The truth is, I just wasn’t very interested. I was just interested in George.”

She withdrew from Smith in 1944 after their engagement was announced. Her fiance, a handsome Navy pilot, was serving in the South Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944, when his plane was hit by enemy fire. He was rescued in the water. They married on Jan. 6, 1945, while George was home on leave. He had named his bomber plane “Barbara.”

After the war, she went with him to New Haven, Conn., where he graduated from Yale University, and then to West Texas.

Many years afterward, she told The Post that her early experiences in Texas helped toughen her for public life. “When you become a couple, all grown up, nobody’s son or daughter, nobody’s shadow, you are you,” she said. “For me, it was a very healthy thing. I grew up after I left the shadow of my mother.”

In 1953, the Bush family was devastated by the prolonged suffering and eventual death of daughter Robin, whose full name was Pauline Robinson Bush. Decades later, Barbara Bush would still choke up when speaking of her.

“I was combing her hair and holding her hand,” she told the “Today” show. “I saw that little body, I saw her spirit go.”

Barbara was thrust into despair by the ordeal and its aftermath. But The Post reported that Robin’s death deepened Mrs. Bush’sbond with her son George, who was 7 at the time. He would tell friends he could not go out to play because his mother needed him, and he worked hard to cheer her up – shaping, as it happened, his ebullient personality.

Mrs. Bush gradually regained her equilibrium. With her husband, she started a foundation that raised money for leukemia research and awareness. She also spent considerable time helping guide her son Neil through his struggles with dyslexia. She said her son’s reading disorder contributed to her devotion to literacy as second lady and then as first lady.

George H.W. Bush’s careers in the oil business and public service often kept him away from home, leaving Mrs. Bush as the authority figure. She drove the car pools and stuffed five kids in the car for the annual summertime cross-country trips to the family retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.

She acknowledged that once her youngest child left the house, she fell into depression. She attributed her feelings, at least in part, to the lack of purpose she felt as her children – and the women’s movement – came of age. “Suddenly women’s lib had made me feel my life had been wasted,” she told USA Today in 1989.

She said that her husband helped her overcome her doubts and that she also began to take satisfaction in seeing her children develop into self-sufficient adults, even if some – particularly the one who would become president – showed fiercely independent sides.

By his own admission, George W. Bush drank too much in his youth and gave his parents many headaches before a newfound religious fervor in his 40s changed his life. Mrs. Bush simply called her son “a late bloomer.”

Neil, the fourth child, was a director of the Denver-based Silverado Savings & Loan and was enmeshed in its collapse in 1988, which cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.He and other directors settled the case, and Neil Bush paid a $50,000 fine.

Besides her husband, survivors include five children, George, Jeb, Marvin, who co-founded an investment firm, Neil Bush and Dorothy “Doro” Bush Koch, who has worked in fundraising and philanthropy; a brother; 17 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

Wellesley controversy

Mrs. Bush generated a flash of controversy when Wellesley College, the women’s school in Massachusetts, invited her to speak at its 1990 commencement. Some students protested, saying the first lady, who had dropped out of college to marry and who had risen to prominence through the accomplishments of her husband, did not represent the type of career woman the college sought to educate.

At the commencement, Mrs. Bush told the graduates to “cherish your human connections: your relationships with family and friends.” She memorably added: “Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as the president’s spouse, and I wish him well.”

She had abandoned some of the reserve she cultivated as first lady by the time her son was elected president in 2000. When George W. Bush’s administration was criticized for its slow response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she told the public radio program “Marketplace” that the Gulf Coast evacuees being housed at Houston’s Astrodome “were underprivileged anyway, so this is working very well for them.”

A White House press secretary tried to play down the remark, saying Mrs. Bush was making a strictly “personal observation.”

In her final years, Barbara Bush lived in the home she and her husband built in Houston and largely stayed out of the spotlight. In 2009, she sat for an interview with Fox News on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas.

“Well, it was a wonderful life that he’s had and I’ve shared,” Mrs. Bush said wistfully, recalling her time with her husband in Washington and China and even the car that first took them to West Texas. “We’ve had a great life.”",17/04/2018
The Denver Post,Group aids special-needs orphans,"Every child should be chosen and dearly loved. Of that there should be no doubt. Yet for orphans with special needs, the chances of finding a forever family are slim.

A recent federal survey shows that 25 percent of adults in the United States consider adopting, yet only 2 percent follow through.

And of that 2 percent, most are interested in adopting only healthy children, having convinced themselves it is too costly or too difficult to raise a child with physical or developmental challenges.

By founding Chosen & Dearly Loved, Mike and Mandy Gallagher have made it their life’s work to change that.

The nonprofit based in Denver was born from the joy that special-needs adoption has brought to their family. Its mission is to eradicate what the Gallaghers describe as “the orphan crisis” and to prove that special-needs kids are “worth the risk, worth the sacrifice, worth the investment.”

Their family of six includes three biological children — Emily, 14; Matthew, 12; and John David, 8 — and three who were adopted.

Hannah, who is Chinese, was born in the United States with spina bifida and club feet. She was 3 months old at the time of her adoption, having been abandoned by parents who wanted a child, but not one with special needs.

Twins Eli and Ellie are from Uganda, born to a mother who was dying of AIDS.

“Special needs don’t define our children, and they don’t hinder us as a family,” Mike Gallagher noted at the Chosen & Dearly Loved Foundation’s inaugural fundraising luncheon Nov. 19 in the Seawell Grand Ballroom. “If anything, they draw us closer and make us more compassionate, understanding and grateful.”

Mike — son of Gallagher Industries founder Charlie Gallagher and his wife, Diane — is the chairman of Educational Outfitters and the volunteer president of Chosen & Dearly Loved.

Mandy did not attend the luncheon because she and the children were in Chicago, where Hannah, 6, is being prepped for a prosthesis following the Oct. 1 amputation of her left foot.

The amputation was performed after multiple other corrective surgeries and will better enable her to walk.

In a video shown at the luncheon, Mandy shared how deeply she was affected, several years ago, when she learned how millions of special-needs orphans worldwide were being abandoned, shunned — even dumped in the trash — because they were born with conditions that range from, but are not limited to, hydrocephalus and HIV to cleft lip and brachial plexus palsy.

After much discussion, and prayer, Mandy and Mike decided to take “a step of love” and adopt. Starting with Hannah, “We went from three (children) to four to six in what seemed like overnight,” Mandy said.

“Without a doubt, it’s been worth it,” Mike added. “It’s a privilege and a gift to be a father to kids who don’t have one.”

In the five years it took to establish Chosen & Dearly Loved, the Gallaghers and their leadership team worked to define and implement four impact areas for work in Uganda, Cambodia, India, Sudan and the United States:

• Adoption grants, where gifts of up to $5,000 are awarded to help with adoption expenses.

• Family Support, which offers training, regional events and a mobile app, all with the goal of building ongoing adoptive communities that help adoptive families thrive.

• Advocacy, where media, speaking and awareness campaigns spur more families considering adoption to move forward and adopt.

• Global Care, an effort to keep families intact by offering training and respite care to the birth parents of special-needs children.

In the past year, the Chosen & Dearly Loved Foundation has made it possible for 40 children to be adopted by families in the United States.

In addition, 219 special-needs children were adopted by families in the children’s native communities. And, the Global Care initiative was successful in keeping 100 special-needs children with their birth families.

James Snook, former vice president of emerging platforms and innovations for Starbucks, and his wife, Millie, are directors of the foundation; Anne and Dr. Kim Ryan train and oversee hundreds of local leaders in India and Cambodia; Catherine Theriault leads the Adoption Grants and Family Support initiatives; David Enge is in charge of communications; and Israel Garcia heads the media advocacy effort.

The luncheon’s $50,000 premier hosts were Bill Coors and Diane and Charlie Gallagher.

Phil and Nancy Anschutz, Cathy and Alex Cranberg, Caryn and Brian Deevy, Lorie and Henry Gordon, Carol and John Saeman and Sharon and Lanny Martin were among the $25,000 hosts.

Other supporters included Ashley and Peyton Manning, Jack Vickers, Nancy and John Sevo, Pam and Ed Diamond, Carol and George Solich and Stanton Dodge

“As our family of supporters grows,” Mike said, “we are excited to help more orphans with special needs know what it means to be chosen and dearly loved sons and daughters.”

The Denver Post,"Voting for aid in dying was easy, but one Colorado couple struggled toward a graceful death","A year ago in November, when Susan and Kurt Huschle cast their ballots in favor of the state’s aid-in-dying law, they viewed the measure with the personal detachment of a distant what-if.

Three months later, Kurt faced a terminal diagnosis of a rare bile-duct cancer. Pain mounted exponentially, blasting through his medication. His once-sturdy frame rapidly diminished. And suddenly, the theoretical idea of ending his life with a doctor-prescribed medication became a very real option — one he desperately wanted to have in hand.

“We voted for it,” Susan recalls, sitting at the kitchen table where she and her husband first heard the news that he didn’t have long to live. “But we didn’t know anything about it.”

On July 16, exactly seven months after the law went into effect with two-thirds of Colorado voters in favor, Kurt took aid-in-dying medication and died, at 58, in his bed at the couple’s Highlands Ranch home. But the process, from paperwork to prescription and finally to practice, bred frustration, stress, uncertainty and ultimately a wife’s panic in his final hours.

Their experience reflected the gap between concept and realization that has characterized the law, which took effect one year ago Saturday. While physicians, pharmacists and hospice workers sorted out their roles in the process, patients sometimes struggled to connect with willing doctors, procure medication and implement their final wishes.

Experiences varied as Colorado became one of seven jurisdictions — along with Oregon, Washington, Montana, California, Vermont and the District of Columbia — to allow patients to choose the option.

“I think many people have the perception that immediately after the law becomes effective, everyone would be able to immediately and easily access it through their own medical providers,” says Kat West, national director of policy and programs for Compassion & Choices, the national nonprofit that drove the initiative for the medical aid-in-dying measure. “That’s just not reality with any new law.”

She spotted him walking toward her in the hallway of a McDonnell Douglas Aerospace building in Huntington Beach, Calif. It was 1987, and Susan was a struggling single mom with three sons. Kurt was a year into his first job out of college. They smiled at each other as their paths converged at the coffee room, but neither spoke.

But the chance meeting with the handsome guy made an indelible mark on Susan.

“A week later, I had a very vivid dream of this mystery guy where we were at an amusement park on some sort of ride with water splashing about,” she recalls. ” He was sitting behind me holding me tight and it felt like love, stability and happiness. These intense feelings lasted for weeks. I knew I had to find this guy.”

She did. Though he was five years younger — she got lots or ribbing for robbing the cradle — they carved out a life together despite the challenge, for Kurt, of suddenly becoming a stepfather. But he grew into that and, years later, even more enthusiastically embraced the role of grandfather.

Susan characterizes her husband with a wide array of descriptors. Engineer, drill sergeant, intellectual. Cro-Magnon man, sports buff, bookworm. But the guy with the off-kilter sense of humor came wrapped in a sunny personality and an irresistible smile. They talked on the phone constantly, often several times a day, to the point that relatives kidded them about acting like teenagers.

“We didn’t care,” Susan says. “We were in love. … It turns out my dream was a revelation that Kurt and I were meant for each other. The love he gave me healed so much pain in my life. Every night Kurt told me, ‘I’m going to take care of you.’ ”

Eventually, she would assume the role of caregiver after Kurt’s cancer diagnosis, and do her best to help him fulfill his choice to end his suffering through aid-in-dying medication. Susan, searching for help amid their frustration with the health care system, read about an Aurora man, Herb Myers, who shared the story of fulfilling his dying wife’s wish to take advantage of the new law.

She sought his counsel and imagined that the final time she spent with her husband would unfold as peacefully as it had for Myers and his wife. But the couple found preparation difficult. The pursuit of the prescription consumed months, and as Kurt’s condition deteriorated, both of them hesitated to broach the subject of exactly how they envisioned the end.

Susan didn’t want her feelings to influence Kurt’s final wishes. And she figures that both of them stayed silent to protect the other from dealing with a painful subject.

“We didn’t take that time to plan anything,” she says. “Then he deteriorated to the point where I was afraid to bring it up, and I think he was afraid to bring it up. We were each in our own minds thinking: How is this going to happen?”

Compassion & Choices now counts 81 health care facilities and 16 hospices statewide with policies supporting an individual’s choice to pursue aid in dying. Catholic-affiliated systems opposed the initiative on religious grounds and do not participate, and some other facilities are still formulating policies. Still, West says, doctors faced with an aid-in-dying request for the first time may need time to consider it.

The organization has created a tool called Find Care that can help individuals identify facilities or hospices that support patients’ end-of-life choices. It does not point patients to specific doctors because that would hurt access by creating bottlenecks and inhibiting the integration of the aid-in-dying option into the health care system. Compassion & Choices also offers a statewide map of health facilities and hospices that support the option.

Although West concludes that the law is working as intended, there remain access issues typically associated with a “ramp-up” period while both providers and patients become familiar with it.

The organization estimates that between 45 and 55 prescriptions have been written in Colorado, based on its contacts with physicians, patients and health care providers, more prescriptions than were written during the first year of the Oregon law on which Colorado’s was based.

Kim Mooney, founder of the end-of-life planning and support organization Practically Dying, says that once the law went into effect, “we lived in chaos for the first couple of months.”

“Everybody was jumping to figure out: What does this mean and how do we do it?” she says. “It took months for that to begin to happen, and it’s still going on. There was a fair amount of chaos driven by the fact that, one, this is a bigger paradigm shift than we thought, and two, it’s a lot more complicated.”

Many hospice physicians have opted out of writing prescriptions for aid in dying, say Tarrah Schreiner, CEO of Sangre de Cristo Hospice & Palliative Care in Pueblo and also vice chair of the statewide Hospice and Palliative Care Association of the Rockies.

Policies and procedures can vary among hospice organizations, she adds, and the law went into effect so quickly — just weeks after the election — that there was little communication from the state about hospices’ role. Consequently, hospices often have learned from counterparts in other states that have had the law in effect longer, while doing their own intensive training within each agency.

“I try to teach from the standpoint that it doesn’t matter if you’re for or against it at this point, it’s a state law in Colorado,” Schreiner says. “We need to support the patient and families as they’re making the decision and are or are not taking the medication. We all need to get on board for that.”

Late last year, Kurt and Susan were embarking on an early retirement, a chance to catch up on years of postponed getaways and, for Kurt, to see whether powering down might ease the persistent and worsening symptoms of what doctors initially diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.

Kurt had begun to have abdominal issues about five years earlier, but the diagnosis made him uncomfortable for an additional reason: his family’s medical history. Heart issues and cancer were pervasive. Colon cancer killed his father at age 62, despite aggressive treatment and short-lived remission, after a wrenching, years-long ordeal that sealed Kurt’s resolve to never die like that, debilitated and in excruciating pain.

So troubling was the family history that he vowed never to father children. So when he and Susan got together, they limited their family to the three kids, now adults, she had from previous marriages.

The abdominal issues persisted, and Kurt eventually found a new doctor who removed part of his colon to treat diverticulitis. That surgery came with an additional dose of stress. Kurt was one of the patients caught up in a drug-tampering scare involving a surgical technician with HIV that required nearly 3,000 patients at Swedish Medical Center to be tested for infection. His test came back negative.

But his pain would not abate, and the accompanying loss of sleep wore him down until he took a buyout from his aerospace engineering job and retired in early November 2016. Meanwhile, he continued to press doctors for answers, fearing the worst. But his cancer concerns were dismissed until he finally underwent more testing.

On Feb. 13, Susan recalls, their home phone rang.

“I hear him answer, ‘Yes, I’m at home. Yes, Susan’s with me. I’m sitting down,’” she says. “Then the doctor told him his colon and stomach were normal, but 60 percent of his liver is covered in cancer.”

The “incidental finding” of his CT scan was Stage IV intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Suddenly, the option of medical aid in dying gained instant currency.

When Kurt, the oldest of five kids, told his youngest brother, Joel, about his cancer diagnosis, he quickly added: “I’m not going out like Dad.” Joel, a psychiatric nurse working in California, understood completely.

“When our father died, we all figured our expired-by dates were sooner than most,” he says. “We’d bantered this around before. We were all pretty much on the same page.”

Under the new Colorado law, Kurt needed two doctors to certify that he was mentally competent and had less than six months to live. Susan says the first doctor they spoke with agreed to follow Kurt’s wishes, but then seemed evasive to the point that, after three months, they sought another doctor who seemed more willing to help.

Still, Susan still felt like they were reluctant trailblazers navigating unfamiliar terrain.

The process itself, just securing the diagnosis and obtaining the prescription, added to Kurt’s stress as the couple felt that they were having to learn the steps and then explain them to medical providers. Once they had completed the necessary forms and gotten the doctors’ go-ahead, there was still the matter of filling a prescription for the medication that would end his life.

Secobarbital, the primary drug of choice in other states that enacted aid in dying, had been what Herb Myers’ wife had used. She had slipped quickly and quietly away. But the $4,100 cost gave Kurt pause. His doctor prescribed a less-expensive combination of drugs that cost $500.

But even with a prescription in hand, procuring the medication wasn’t easy. When they finally found a pharmacy that could fill it, they learned it was the first time that location had ever filled an aid-in-dying prescription. They were told the morphine compound would work in two to four hours. The required request-for-medication form notes that most deaths occur within three hours, though some can take longer.

On July 10, Kurt and Susan celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary — they had been a couple for five years before getting married — with a brief trip to a nearby restaurant. Kurt, who slept most of the day, could barely keep his eyes open.

They had set up Kurt’s bed in the main floor study of their two-story home, so he wouldn’t have to negotiate stairs, and hospice had come on board. Six days after their anniversary, Kurt decided that the time had come.

Around 4:30 a.m. on July 16, Susan heard him shuffling around in the living room. She got up and went to her husband, a shadow of his former self who in the previous six weeks had lost 45 pounds.

“He’s walking toward me,” she recounts, “and I’m walking toward him. And he said, ‘I want to die. Will you just let me go? I want to go!’ And he starts crying. He said, ‘I’m in pain.’ I said, ‘We’ll figure it out.’ ”

The hospice nurse arrived a few hours later. Susan says she explained that Kurt wanted to take the aid-in-dying medication to begin the process, and the nurse got down on her knees and looked him in the eye to be sure he was cognizant of his decision.

Kurt decided he would take the compound at noon. Susan sent the nurse away because they had decided to do this by themselves, and then sat next to Kurt on the bed and read aloud some of their anniversary cards.

That brought them both to tears, and Kurt finally told her, “I want to go now.”

She got his medication and followed the directions, mixing two small bottles into a bigger bottle and shaking it. Some spilled on her, and when she went to wash it off, he began drinking the compound.

“But with every sip,” Susan says, “he’s choking and coughing, choking and coughing.”

It went on for nearly 20 minutes. Then he reclined, and his eyes rolled back and he began to breathe differently — two breaths, then a long pause, then two more. Susan thought he would pass any minute and laid next to him. Although he never regained consciousness, the gasping, uneven breathing continued.

Two hours passed. Then four hours.

“At 4:15,” Susan says, “I started to majorly panic.”

As she tried without success to reach a doctor, a couple more disturbing thoughts crossed her mind: She feared that Kurt, despite his unconsciousness, could hear everything — the calls, the desperation in her voice. And she wondered if his choking when he first took the medication meant that he had aspirated enough to delay its effect.

Around 7 p.m., she asked hospice to send a nurse. Shortly after the nurse arrived, a doctor called and suggested some additional measures. Soon after, Susan saw her husband sit up slightly and appear to retch three times. She ran to his bedside. Then he slid back into his pillows and stopped breathing.

He died at 8:15 p.m.

Susan probably will never know why it took so long. Did Kurt’s pacemaker keep the drug from stopping his heart? Did not enough medication get into his system? Did he use the wrong prescription? The effectiveness of drugs can vary with the individual, though they normally work in a matter of hours. But in one unusual case, a Colorado patient who used the more expensive Seconal took 2 1/2 days to die.

Kurt’s brother Joel, tracking the process by phone from California, says that while his brother’s death didn’t unfold as simply as everyone hoped, it couldn’t have been worse than what the disease already was putting him through.

“I think he went out as gracefully as possible under the method used,” he says. “It wasn’t ideal, and I think it was rougher on family than it was on him, truth be told.”

Without question, it took a toll on Susan, especially the fact that Kurt’s apparent coughing and choking after swallowing the medication kept them from saying the kind of goodbye she had imagined. In the immediate aftermath, she describes herself as “numb, in shock, stressed.”

In the five months since her husband died, she has replayed the experience again and again, reviewing what she considers a “nearly insurmountable” process. Kurt’s decision to use the aid-in-dying protocol was his own, and it was the right one, she says. And she’s hopeful that in the future the process will be less fraught with roadblocks, uncertainty and frustration.

“This law did not work in the way intended for Kurt, but I still believe in it,” Susan says. “I want it to be better. I want it to be fixed, and not put on the dying patient. With it being new, all we can do is be forgiving of that part.”",14/12/2017
The Denver Post,Guest commentary: Pot should be option for PTSD sufferers,"Critics of medical marijuana won a victory when the Colorado Board of Health voted 6-2 against adding PTSD to the list of approved conditions for the state’s medical marijuana program.

The arguments against adding PTSD to the list of approved conditions are not without merit. There is evidence that heavy marijuana use is correlated with the development of anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, and can exacerbate the effects of these conditions, particularly for people with a genetic predisposition.

Even so, the negative effects of marijuana use on some, or even most patients with PTSD does not merit a complete ban on its use for medical purposes.

All patients are different and respond differently to various treatments, so it’s important to give doctors and patients the flexibility they need. To a certain degree this flexibility already exists; doctors regularly prescribe medications off-label to treat conditions not intended by the FDA.

This is why right-to-try laws are so valuable, and not just to terminally ill patients. Healthcare professionals need as many treatment options as possible to fulfill their obligations under the Hippocratic oath, to “apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required”.

And there is significant evidence of medical marijuana’s success in treating PTSD. A 2014 study examined New Mexico’s medical marijuana patients with PTSD. It found a significant decline in symptoms related to PTSD for patients treated with marijuana.

Another study involving mice with induced PTSD showed reduced negative symptoms when certain cannabinoid receptors were stimulated. Similar results were found in humans, leading researchers to recommend complementing therapy with cannabinoid receptor stimuli.

It is possible that this is a placebo effect. Some studies show positive reactions attributable to the placebo effect when treating PTSD. This is a danger to patients treated for cancer or HIV/AIDS, but some psychologists aren’t concerned about the placebo effect when treating mental illness, as long as it produces the desired results.

But even if marijuana offers no benefits to those suffering from PTSD, it should still be an option available for doctors.

There are many PTSD sufferers who use marijuana expecting relief for their symptoms. An estimated 21 per cent of people diagnosed with PTSD self-medicate, often in place of professional help.

If marijuana is actively harmful for PTSD treatment, then we should allow people to talk about it with their doctor. If marijuana were approved to treat PTSD, then patients would be incentivized to pursue this option to avoid paying taxes on the recreational marijuana they would otherwise use.

Patients will be given guidance on how to properly administer something they were already going to use. They will have their progress monitored by a healthcare professional, mitigating the risks associated with marijuana and mental health conditions.

Even better, patients can be pointed towards other, more universally accepted treatments for PTSD like therapy — the most widely supported method of treatment. Patients who come in looking for medical marijuana can be directed to therapy, but only if the incentive to seek treatment exists.

This is crucially important. The same study that reported that 21 per cent of PTSD sufferers self medicate also reported an increased risk of suicide among those who self-medicate with drugs other than alcohol. No matter the reason these patients go into the doctor’s office, they will report their symptoms to someone who can direct them to the help they need.

The highest priority of policymakers should be to make it as easy as possible for patients suffering from PTSD to be treated successfully, and the most effective way to do this is by expanding the options available to patients. More information on the efficacy of marijuana to treat PTSD will become available if the CARERS act is passed. But before a more robust body of evidence exists, those who have their symptoms alleviated, no matter how few in number, should have access to a treatment that works for them.

The Denver Post,Philanthropy in marijuana industry finding larger acceptance,"One marijuana business hosts an annual golf tournament in Denver to raise money for multiple sclerosis research. Another Colorado pot company donates to a gay-rights advocacy group and is a sponsor of an AIDS walk.

As marijuana legalization matures, businesses are becoming more ingrained in their communities by donating cash and time to charities — a sign that the stigma of selling a drug that remains illegal under federal law may be fading.

“It’s not all about making money and about profiting,” said Ean Seeb, co-owner of Denver Relief, a dispensary whose monetary and volunteering donations include Ekar Farm and Garden, which grows vegetables for food banks.

It’s unknown how much money marijuana businesses have donated to nonprofits nationally and in Colorado.

He is a director at the firm Ireland Stapleton, which hosted a meeting in July at the state Capitol regarding donations with about 150 people from charitable organizations, lawyers and pot companies.

The Department of Justice, which has been watching the growing legal pot industries, declined to comment. The IRS declined to comment, except to say that marijuana businesses can’t write off donations on tax filings.

Colorado residents, for example, gave $3.4 billion to charities in 2012, the most recent data available from the IRS, according to the Colorado Association of Funders, a group that represents foundations.

Colorado foundations themselves donated about $800 million to charities in 2013.

The state has nearly 30,000 nonprofits, some of them tiny organizations, all competing for funds, said Joanne Kelley, executive director of the Colorado Association of Funders.

Enter the highly profitable legal marijuana industry, which was worth $2.7 billion in 2014, according to industry investment and research firm The ArcView Group.

But the industry’s profitability, and the charities’ need for contributions, is only one reason nonprofits and pot businesses have developed relationships.

Many in the marijuana industry have been big believers of the drug’s medical value and that has carried over to philanthropy, while the charities themselves sometimes serve populations that use the drug for ailments.

Matt Huron, founder and CEO of Good Chemistry in Colorado, traces his company’s philanthropy to his time managing a marijuana cooperative that grew pot for people who used it medically in San Francisco.

His father and his partner, who were both HIV positive, used the drug medically. His father died in 2009.

Huron said when it came to giving, he wanted “to keep that spirit alive” when he started his business in Colorado. But he found that some nonprofits were unwilling to accept donations from his company.

While reluctance is fading, he said, a stigma remains.

“We’re still breaking federal law,” he added.

Huron’s company donates to One Colorado, a gay rights advocacy group, but he declined to say how much.

Dave Montez, executive director of One Colorado, said his organization’s standard for accepting donations comes down to whether the contributor is accepting of the gay community.

“Good Chemistry exemplifies a local business who is committed to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Coloradans by treating their employees fairly as well as giving back to the community,” he said in a statement.

Another marijuana business, The Clinic, hosts an annual golf tournament to raise money for the Colorado and Wyoming chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

The Clinic’s general manager, Ryan Cook, said employees also participate in an annual MS walk to raise money and have contributed nearly $291,000 since 2009 from that event and the golf tournament.

Kaylin Daniels, donor relations officer at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, noted that medical marijuana use is acceptable among its constituency. And she said states’ approval of medical and particularly recreational pot in Colorado has helped develop a connection with The Clinic.

Just last year, Daniels said, The Clinic “became the top corporate team for Walk MS for Colorado and Wyoming.”

Still, some nonprofits are wary of marijuana donations. The Children’s Hospital Colorado Foundation has a policy of not accepting such donations, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Whitehead, because the drug is still illegal federally.

Connie Zimmerman, founder of Colorado Homeless Families, which helps with transitional housing, has not been offered help from marijuana businesses but said she wouldn’t accept it because she considers the drug detrimental to her clients.

“We don’t feel right about accepting donations from the profits and proceeds of the marijuana business that can devalue or diminish the quality of the family and lifestyle relationships of individuals,” Zimmerman said.",29/10/2015

“We don’t feel right about accepting donations from the profits and proceeds of the marijuana business that can devalue or diminish the quality of the family and lifestyle relationships of individuals,” Zimmerman said.",29/10/2015
The Denver Post,Surgical tech blamed horrors of Afghanistan deployment for addiction,"Rocky Allen volunteered for deployment to Afghanistan in 2010 while in the U.S. Navy, eager to put his skills as a surgical technologist to work saving the lives of injured soldiers, records show.

He was so idealistic that he signed up for a second tour of duty before he had even arrived at the emergency military hospital at the air base in Kandahar. He left in disgrace nearly a year later after his court-martial for the theft of powerful liquid painkillers. By that time, he had witnessed an ongoing stream of death and mayhem, which he said led him to steal fentanyl for the first time, records show.

“I never had a patient die on my operating table until I came here,” he testified during his court-martial proceeding. “Your honor, to have the number go from zero to 14 in less than six months is a numbing experience, and it will forever be imprinted in my mind.”

Gone was the free-spirited, happy-go-lucky corpsman who loved playing volleyball, according to the testimony of his friends, superiors and Allen himself. Surgeons at the operating room where Allen worked reported at least 24 double or triple amputees during Allen’s deployment there.

A transcript of the proceedings released this week by the Army, which handled the court-martial, detail the unraveling of a young man who said he had dreamed of a career in medicine from his childhood in Idaho. Federal public defender Timothy O’Hara, in a court hearing last month, said Allen’s experiences in Afghanistan left him a drug addict and turned him into the man now accused of hospital drug thefts

.

Despite the 2011 court-martial, Allen found work in hospital operating rooms across the western United States over the next five years. He was able to feed his habit with little consequence, according to court records, and may have put thousands of patients at risk of contracting hepatitis and HIV.

After his discharge from the Navy, Allen was fired from at least five hospitals where he worked in California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado, including Swedish Medical Center in Englewood. One hospital said it found him swapping a doctor’s fentanyl with a syringe of saline solution and informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Another discovered him passed out on the floor and, upon testing him for drugs, found fentanyl in his system.

He now faces federal drug theft charges in connection with the alleged theft of a syringe filled with fentanyl from an operating room at Swedish. He has pleaded not guilty. The hospital fired him in January.

Allen is carrying a bloodborne pathogen, authorities said. Thousands of former patients at the facilities where he worked have been warned that they should be tested to make sure they did not contract HIV or hepatitis from a syringe Allen may have used.

The nearly 30 pages of testimony released by the Army offer a detailed view of his descent into what his lawyer has called a long-term addiction.

Prior to his deployment in Afghanistan, Allen had received accolades as a surgical tech at a naval hospital in Washington. He had been promoted to head supply tech there and was put in charge of a budget of more than $4 million, records show.

By the time of his court-martial, he was pleading from the witness stand that he only be allowed “to return to the place where I can start my healing.”

“What many don’t understand is that we see hundreds of service members come through those (operating room) doors mangled and torn apart,” Allen told the court-martial panel. “It was my job to put up those emotional blinders and do everything that I could to help save the patient’s life. Ultimately, those blinders fell.”

Allen said he believed his court-martial could have been a turning point for him. He told the panel and chief military justice that he was on the path to recovery. Professional counseling and the support of family and friends were helping him put his depression and post-traumatic stress behind him, Allen testified.

He confessed to using a surgical wire to pick open hospital lockers where the fentanyl vials were stored at the military hospital in Kandahar. He said he planned to use the drugs to escape the horror of being in Afghanistan but instead threw the drugs away. About two weeks after the theft of the fentanyl vials, a commander saw Allen slip a fentanyl syringe from a container at the hospital into his back pocket, according to testimony.

Allen entered into a negotiated plea agreement. He was sentenced to 90 days’ confinement, which was reduced to 60 days in accordance with a pretrial agreement. He also received a one-step reduction in rank. About six months later, he received a general discharge from the Navy.

The Navy has not released records connected to a hearing held when he was back in the United States that preceded his discharge.

Allen touted his military experience when applying for hospital jobs. The Navy has said records of the court-martial would have been available if hospitals had requested them.

But the Navy confirmed the court-martial to The Denver Post only after Allen’s military prosecution was discussed during the court hearing. Obtaining records of the proceedings took three weeks. After Allen was charged last month, the Navy provided a brief account of where he was stationed and the medals he was awarded.

During the court-martial proceedings, fellow workers described Allen as having a keen mind for surgery and a stellar disposition upon his arrival in Afghanistan.

When drugs first turned up missing from the hospital at Kandahar, Julie Witmer, the head of the intensive care unit there, never thought of Allen as the culprit.

“When it comes to his skills as a surgical tech, he does his job top-notch,” she testified. “I was extremely shocked when he told me about the crimes because I didn’t believe that he would do something like that. I believe that I knew him.”

She said she cried when he finally confessed to her an extended time after the drugs turned up missing.

Allen originally had signed up for a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan, but he put in paperwork for a six-month extension to his tour before his actual deployment. It was a decision he regretted soon after arriving, but he did not succeed in getting the extension reversed.

Witmer said he told her he had grown more despondent than ever upon learning he would have to stay.

“The only explanation when I asked him was that he wanted to forget his time here,” Witmer recalled in testimony.

Barbara Mayer, who was the leading petty officer at the military hospital, said Allen arrived as an exceptional surgical technologist but was shattered by the “controlled chaos” he witnessed.

Among the worst were the native children who needed treatment for burns caused when oil lamps fell over and set their homes on fire, Mayer said. Then there were the soldiers with limbs blown off, calling out the names of their wives and children and their fellow soldiers as they died, she said.

Allen testified that before his deployment, he knew his experience in Afghanistan would be life-changing.

“I knew that this was another journey that I needed to take in my life to help the wounded service members serving this great country,” he said.

Allen said he believed he was prepared for the mission, but that was when he thought it would be all about saving lives. He said it was anything but just that.

“Nothing can prepare you for the first time a patient comes through those doors screaming for you to not let them die,” he testified. “Then to have to tell them that you’re going to do everything in your power to help them, only to watch them die as you and everyone on your team does everything to save them.”

The Denver Post,Did Rocky Allen invent his surgical tech past that got him job at Swedish?,"When Rocky Allen applied to become a surgical technologist at Swedish Medical Center, he touted his years of experience overseas with a medical defense contractor called CMC Contractor Corp.

He also named his former boyfriend, Anthony Incardona, as the company’s human resources director and a reference.

But in an interview last week with The Denver Post, Incardona said he knew nothing of CMC Contractor Corp. He also said U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigators had just visited him to inquire about CMC.

“CMC, I don’t even know what it is,” Incardona said. “I’ve never seen that company. I’ve never been a reference for him that I’m aware of.”

Allen, 28, faces federal criminal charges for allegedly stealing a syringe of fentanyl — a powerful narcotic painkiller — at Swedish and replacing it with a syringe containing no fentanyl. He has pleaded not guilty.

Investigators are now trying to determine whether Allen fabricated a defense contractor in order to gain employment and access to fentanyl.

“The investigation is ongoing, and as such, additional charges are possible,” said Jeffrey Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver.

The U.S. Department of Defense could not find CMC Corp. among companies with contracts of $7 million or more.

Allen’s application to Swedish states that he worked as a surgical technologist for CMC in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Yemen from January 2012 to January 2013 and May 2013 to May 2014.

But Incardona said Allen was in the United States during those years.

In his application to Swedish, the only contact information Allen gave for CMC was an e-mail address. By comparison, his July application to register as a surgical technologist in Colorado doesn’t mention CMC at all.

Swedish hired him a month later and fired him in late January.

Allen’s overseas employment claims have thrown another twist into a criminal case that has left thousands of hospital patients wondering whether he infected them.

At Swedish , about 2,900 patients who had surgeries while Allen worked there have been offered free tests for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

A federal court hearing in Denver disclosed that Allen carries a bloodborne pathogen and that four hospitals in Arizona, California and Washington state had fired him before he came to Colorado.

He had been court-martialed in 2011 for stealing fentanyl while enlisted in the U.S. Navy. The Navy confirmed the court-martial to The Denver Post only after Allen’s military prosecution was discussed during the court hearing. It had previously provided a brief account of where Allen was stationed and the medals he was awarded.

In a statement, Swedish said it checks applicants thoroughly.

“Like most hospitals, our hiring process includes a background check by a third party, interviews by managers and peers, confirmation of training and certification, state registration and pre-employment drug screening,” spokeswoman Nicole Williams said.

Hollynd Hoskins, a lawyer representing some of the patients who had surgery while Allen worked at Swedish, said she’s not surprised by the questions arising around Allen’s application.

“It speaks volumes to how Swedish Medical Center dropped the ball in performing an appropriate and careful employee screening and in conducting a thorough background search on this individual prior to hiring him,” Hoskins said. “Hospitals have to do a better job of putting patient safety ahead of profits.”

The professional profile Allen gave Swedish did not mention that he had been fired by other hospitals for fentanyl theft and misuse, nor his Navy court-martial.

It relied heavily on his purported overseas employment that filled time gaps after his Navy discharge.

Besides the Navy, he cited employment with “CMC Contractor Corp. (DOD contracted Frontline Medical Division)” as his prior professional experience.

“I have been a surgical technologist for 7 years and I have a very wide range of clinical experience which I have gained working in various surgical setting including a total of 3 years spent in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Kuwait,” he wrote.

He described himself as a “great critical thinker with years of training and skills working under stress and reacting quickly to emergency patient care situations,” including a year in Afghanistan with the Navy and “the 2 years as a Contracted Front Line Medic.”

Allen wrote that he had worked for CMC in all four countries as a “front line medic, surgical technologist, sterile processing.”

His reference was Incardona, who he said was head of human resources at CMC. He provided an e-mail but no phone number or location for the company.

A Department of Defense spokesman, Maj. Adrian Rankine-Galloway, confirmed that CMC Contractor Corp. does not appear to be among the contractors in its database. But “if the contract was under $7 million, we would not have any information on that contract,” he said.

Incardona said he and Allen had a rocky relationship and broke up several times during their four years together. Allen could never hold steady work as a surgical technologist, Incardona said. During their time together, he said, Allen hid his addiction to fentanyl and the reasons he was fired.

“We were always trying to start fresh,” Incardona said. “I got different stories all the time.”

He said Allen would tell him that he had offended someone at the hospital, or that he was still on probation.

“I was extremely shocked to learn he was using drugs,” Incardona said.

He said he finally found out about Allen’s fentanyl addiction in texts from his cousin, who had seen the news of Allen’s firing from Swedish in Colorado.

Allen also had been fired after working about a month at Scripps Green Hospital in La Jolla, Calif., after he was observed replacing a doctor’s fentanyl syringe with a syringe filled with saline, according to court documents. When confronted by a hospital official, he produced the fentanyl, which he had hidden in a syringe.

Incardona said they moved from San Diego to Arizona, where Allen worked briefly at two hospitals in 2014.

Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale fired Allen after he was found going through a container that held used needles and syringes, according to court testimony. HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix fired him when he tested positive for fentanyl, after he was found passed out.

Incardona recalled that he and Allen’s sister and her husband once had to rush to pick up Allen from an emergency room. He had passed out while working during surgery. Allen had said he was under too much stress and was exhausted, Incardona said.

Incardona said Allen regularly smoked marijuana, but Incardona never knew him to take harder drugs, and Allen never said anything about the court-martial.

Now that Allen has been reported to carry a bloodborne pathogen, Incardona said he has had himself tested to see whether he has been infected. He’s still waiting for results.",05/03/2016
The Denver Post,Hospital says it told DEA of surgical tech’s fentanyl theft in 2013,"A California hospital says it notified the federal Drug Enforcement Administration three years ago of a fentanyl theft after Rocky Allen was caught swapping syringes.

Yet the surgical technologist still was able to find jobs with three hospitals in Arizona and Colorado — where he put the health of thousands of patients at risk.

Scripps Green Hospital of La Jolla, Calif., announced Monday that 518 patients who had surgery while Allen worked there will be offered free blood tests.

That means nearly 5,000 patients in three states may have been put at risk by a 28-year-old surgical technologist with an addiction to fentanyl, a powerful narcotic drug.

Allen worked for Scripps for 20 days as a trainee in 2013 before he was fired for attempting to steal fentanyl.

The hospital said it notified the DEA on June 7, 2013, of the theft. “At the time of Allen’s termination, Scripps did notify the (DEA) of the reason for his termination,” the hospital said in a statement.

A spokesman for the DEA said he could not confirm the agency received that report.

The DEA requires practitioners including hospitals and doctors to notify the agency of the theft of controlled substances and to submit a form.

After leaving California, Allen worked briefly at two Phoenix-area hospitals, including one that fired him after a drug test found fentanyl in his system.

Swedish Medical Center in Englewood hired Allen in August. He concealed his history when he went from hospital to hospital. Swedish fired him last month after he allegedly was caught stealing a fentanyl syringe. Swedish notified 2,900 patients this month that he could have risked their exposure to HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the DEA are investigating the Swedish case, and Allen faces federal criminal charges of drug diversion.

Dave Sanders, a local DEA agent, could not confirm the agency received the theft report from Scripps in 2013. But Sanders said Colorado agents recently learned about Allen’s problems there.

Investigators “found out the employment history and contacted La Jolla and found out he was employed out there about the same time the loss and theft occurred,” Sanders said.

Asked what hospitals can learn from the DEA about drug-diversion cases, Sanders said the agency does not disclose information about someone suspected of stealing drugs if there is an active investigation or a prior investigation.

But if that person has been charged with the theft, “we can say that he was charged previously and they can check on their own,” Sanders said.

Swedish, where a witness reported seeing Allen replace a fentanyl syringe with another containing none of the painkiller, has offered free blood tests to patients whose surgeries occurred between Aug. 17 and Jan. 22. Some of those patients have said they experienced extreme pain after their surgeries, indicating they may not have received adequate doses of painkillers.

At a federal court hearing Friday, a special agent for the FDA testified that about 1,400 patients have been offered blood tests at Banner Thunderbird hospital in Glendale, Ariz., where Allen worked for about six weeks in 2014. The hospital has not confirmed that number.

HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Hospital in Phoenix fired Allen in October 2014 after he tested positive for fentanyl. The hospital has offered tests to 97 patients.

The hearing also disclosed that Allen carries an unnamed bloodborne pathogen. Those pathogens include, but are not limited to, the diseases for which hospitals are offering tests.

At Scripps, Allen “was immediately placed on investigatory leave and was fired when Scripps determined he was trying to switch a syringe of fentanyl citrate — a pain medication — with a syringe of saline,” the hospital said. “Because Allen was under close supervision during his training period, it is believed he would have had little opportunity to successfully switch patient medications.”

The hospital said it began an internal investigation “as concerns over Mr. Allen’s activities at hospitals through the United States came to light” and that it has been working with the Health and Human Services Agency in San Diego County to determine whether patients have been put at risk.

Scripps said it had found no evidence that patients were harmed, but “out of an abundance of caution,” it will offer tests to patients beginning this week.

The dismissal letter in California, released in court in Colorado, says Allen was “observed watching the doctor and when he turned his back to draw up medication, you were seen switching syringes and taking the syringe from the cart and placing it in your scrub pants. Less than a minute later, you said you had to get back to your room and left.”

The letter says he acknowledged taking the syringe, hiding it in his sock and replacing it with a syringe full of saline.

In his hospital applications, Allen emphasized his military service and his work as a surgical tech with the Navy, including an Afghanistan deployment. Still, his applications were marked by time gaps and restaurant jobs.

Allen’s application for work at Scripps listed his previous employer as Northwest Hospital & Medical Center in Seattle. On the application, he listed “was let go/laid off” as his reason for leaving.

The form also asked, “May we contact this employer?”

“No,” he wrote.

Colorado regulates surgical technologists, but the state does not perform background checks on applicants. At Scripps, spokeswoman Janice Collins said California does not regulate them, but “that’s been raised now. We’ve been talking to the county health department about it.”

Collins said she believes Allen told the hospital he was laid off in Seattle. “We didn’t get anything back from our background checks that would have precluded him from being hired.”

Allen was fired by Northwest in March 2012 after working there for less than three months.

Karen Peck, a Northwest spokeswoman, said the hospital does not disclose why someone was terminated. The hospital is “still investigating whether to notify patients,” she said.

The Denver Post,"Swedish Medical tech was fired by 4 hospitals, suffers from bloodborne pathogen","The surgical technologist accused of stealing a powerful narcotic drug at Swedish Medical Center had been fired by four hospitals in other states, including one that dismissed him for swapping syringes.

He also carries a bloodborne pathogen, authorities said. Bloodborne pathogens are infectious microorganisms that include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.

Despite a drug addiction, Rocky Allen was able to move from state to state and hospital to hospital, gaining access to operating rooms and fentanyl syringes, a criminal investigator testified Friday in federal court.

Christy Berg, a special agent for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, testified that Allen accomplished this by concealing his employment history from one hospital to another. He quickly lost every job for drug-related reasons.

At one hospital, he was found passed out, Berg said. At another, he was caught going through a container for used needles.

“A drug seeker is someone who will do anything to get a drug,” Berg said. “They’re so desperate for their drugs they don’t care about other people.”

She described fentanyl as an extremely potent narcotic, “80 to 100 times stronger than morphine.” Fentanyl is commonly used as part of anesthesia to help prevent pain after surgery or other medical procedures.

Allen, 28, was fired by Englewood-based Swedish late last month after he allegedly was caught taking a syringe containing fentanyl and replacing it with another syringe in an operating room. The hospital has contacted 2,900 patients whose surgeries occurred between Aug. 17, 2015, and Jan. 22, to be tested for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

History of hospitals

Court documents released Friday show that Swedish was not the first hospital to terminate Allen for an alleged drug diversion.

In June 2013, Allen was fired from Scripps Green Hospital in La Jolla, Calif., after he was observed replacing a doctor’s fentanyl syringe with a syringe filled with saline, according to court documents. When confronted about the switch, he produced the fentanyl syringe, which he had hidden in his sock, and admitted that he planned to inject it, his termination letter states.

The hospital did not respond immediately to a call for comment.

Allen was fired by Northwest Hospital & Medical Center in Seattle in March 2012 after working there for less than three months. A spokeswoman for Northwest confirmed Allen was employed there but said she was just learning of the situation and declined to comment further.

The Denver Post has reported that Allen had worked briefly for two Arizona hospitals and was fired from one of them, HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Hospital in Phoenix, in October 2014. Court records show he tested positive for fentanyl while working there as a surgical attendant.

Allen worked at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale, Ariz., for about six weeks in 2014.

Both Arizona hospitals are offering free blood tests to surgery patients during the times Allen was employed there.

Berg said she thought about 1,400 Banner Thunderbird patients have been offered tests. A spokesman would not confirm that number Friday.

Friday’s hearing also raised questions about Allen’s military history and whether he failed to get drug-abuse treatment during a four-year stint in the Navy.

Judge Kristen Mix asked about military criminal proceedings that appeared to be related to similar conduct and ended with a general discharge from the Navy, where Allen had served as a surgical technologist.

A Navy summary of Allen’s service provided to The Post did not identify criminal charges or his discharge status.

Timothy O’ Hara, Allen’s lawyer, said his client was sent to Afghanistan in 2010, putting in 12-hour days, seven days a week, and “he worked with individuals wounded in battle, and he observed absolute horrors.”

Allen did not receive treatment from the Navy for substance abuse or post-traumatic stress, O’Hara said. The judge called that alarming.

Melissa Rochefort, who worked as a patient care coordinator at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bremerton, Wash., with Allen, recalled that he excelled as a surgical technologist there nearly a decade ago.

“He was a sweet kid,” she said. “It’s really sad how drugs can change a person and make them do things you would never think they would do. We loved him at the hospital.”

She recently sent a text to her old friend, the person she knew as a young idealist raised in Idaho, offering him support following his indictment. He didn’t reply.

The court hearing was held to decide whether Allen should be freed or kept in custody. Judge Mix ordered Allen released to a halfway house or community corrections, citing his previously clean criminal record as a civilian.

Allen left home to stay with family members in Idaho during the investigation of his activities at Swedish, and prosecutors argued he poses a flight risk.

O’Hara countered that Allen had kept in touch with a Colorado lawyer and came back on schedule to surrender.

Facing charges

Federal agents arrested Allen on Tuesday. He was handcuffed during the hearing, where Mix ruled that his condition be referred to using the term “bloodborne pathogen.”

He faces charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit.

A federal grand jury indictment says Allen tampered and attempted to tamper with a syringe containing fentanyl citrate by removing the syringe containing the substance and replacing it with a similar syringe containing “other substances.”

Berg testified that the syringe that Allen allegedly removed from the operating room was labeled to contain five times the amount of fentanyl as the one he replaced it with, Berg said. But that syringe contained no fentanyl, she said.

Allen showed up in operating Room 5 when he had been assigned to a different room, and a witness saw him approach a machine where drugs are dispensed, she said.

The witness, who said she had spotted Allen take something days earlier, “saw him go over there, put down a syringe, pick up a syringe and leave the room,” Berg testified.

The witness “told the anesthesiologist, ‘Don’t use that syringe.’ He was very taken aback,” she said.

A sweep of Allen’s locker at Swedish found a bin with three needles and a syringe, Berg said.

A urine test found Allen positive for fentanyl and marijuana, according to a state order suspending his registration as a surgical technologist.

Swedish and state health officials have not released any results concerning patients who had blood tests. A Denver attorney, James Avery, says two of his clients, a 56-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman, have tested positive for hepatitis.

Colorado regulates surgical techs, requiring them to list their work history when they register with the state. Allen did not disclose that he had been fired by other hospitals. The state does not verify information in the applications

Many states do not regulate surgical techs, and there’s no nationwide oversight, either.

Diana Protopapa, a lobbyist for surgical technologists and surgical assistants in Colorado, expressed outrage that Allen moved so easily from one hospital to another, repeatedly gaining access to narcotics.

“It means the lack of regulation of surgical technologists and assistants nationwide poses a serious threat to patient safety,” she said. “This is ridiculous.”

The Denver Post,Flam: Squeezed between Zika panic and complacency,"No matter how things play out with the fast-spreading Zika virus, people are likely to end up angry at public health authorities.

It’s possible the situation will become worse than expected, both worldwide and in the U.S., where some spread can’t be ruled out. Zika may be blamed for some U.S. cases of microcephaly — the birth deformity tentatively linked to the outbreak in Brazil. If that happens, health officials will be slammed for downplaying danger, as they were during the 2014 Ebola crisis.

Or the epidemic may turn out to be smaller than expected and may never spread within the U.S. In that case, the public will accuse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization of scaremongering and overreaction, as happened following two fizzled flu outbreaks, bird flu in 2004 and H1N9 in 2009.

It will be easy in hindsight to pinpoint how the authorities got it wrong, but for the time being they are doing one thing right. In their attempts to impart an appropriate level of concern, both the CDC and WHO are being straightforward with the public about how little is known.

They are doing a much better job leveling with people about uncertainties concerning Zika than they did during the Ebola outbreak, said Peter Sandman, a risk communication consultant who has advised public health officials on everything from vaccines to GMO crops to climate change.

Threats tend to generate both danger and outrage. In the Ebola outbreak, the danger to the average American was small, Sandman said, but the outrage wasn’t. That was because the disease spread to a few people in hospitals after assurances that the public health system could contain it.

Zika is unpredictable. The mosquito-borne virus was discovered in Africa in 1947, and until 2014 it had never been detected in the Americas. It was considered a silent or mild infection not associated with any severe health complications until 2015, when doctors in Brazil started to report an alarming increase in the incidence of a microcephaly — a birth defect characterized by a small head and incomplete brain development.

Scientists can’t be certain the birth defects are caused by the Zika virus. They can’t put a number on the risk faced by a pregnant woman who is exposed. Equally murky is the strength of circumstantial evidence that Zika infection can lead to a temporary but dangerous form of paralysis known as Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Sandman, working with his wife, Jody Lanard, evaluated the current Zika warnings and found that public health authorities have neither been too alarmist nor too calm. “They are trying to arouse appropriate fear about a potentially cataclysmic pregnancy outcome,” they wrote in an e-mail.

WHO has estimated that between 3 and 4 million people could become infected worldwide — a range that experts found reasonable, though there’s no indication how this will translate into birth defects or other health problems. On Monday the WHO declared an international public health emergency — a designation used only three times in the past. While there’s nothing binding in such a declaration, it’s likely to step up the sense of urgency.

Sandman and Lanard argue that making such a global declaration is reasonable in an uncertain situation, when it’s better to err on the side of caution than to underreact.

CDC’s message has been more reassuring since its mission is to focus on the United States. There have been a few cases here, acquired in other countries, but no evidence the disease has spread within the 50 states. It’s possible that Zika could advance in the U.S., since the mosquito species responsible for transmitting the disease lives there. But how do you convey a theoretical risk?

Sandman and Lanard say CDC got the tone about right in telebriefings last Thursday and Friday. Officials warned of the possibility of “limited outbreaks” in the U.S. while explaining that this prediction was based primarily on experience with similar mosquito borne viruses — dengue and chikungunya — that did not become U.S. epidemics.

Some critics in the popular press are accusing the CDC of underplaying the problem. Last week, an opinion article in the New York Post accused it of “brushing off the Zika virus.” The piece scolded the agency for not putting more effort into mosquito eradication.

“Unbelievably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has no intention of helping communities in the United States eradicate mosquitoes, even though it’s immersed in the same fight against mosquito-borne disease in other countries across the globe.”

Eradicating mosquitoes is not that easy. While some have suggested a reintroduction of the banned insecticide DDT, University of Minnesota epidemiologist Michael Osterholm says that’s a red herring. There are other insecticides, he said, and while spraying makes for dramatic TV footage, mosquito control depends primarily on the unglamorous job of cleaning up old tires and plastic trash where water collects and mosquitoes breed. The species spreading the disease in Latin America, he said, thrives in cluttered urban areas.

Some scientists are exploring the release of genetically modified mosquitoes designed to introduce fatal genes into the existing population. Others say the most practical long-term solution is a vaccine. Philip Russell, a virologist who oversaw Ebola and other emerging disease research for the Army, said that effective vaccines have been made against similar viruses. Zika wouldn’t present the kinds of technical hurdles that have held up vaccines for HIV and malaria. How fast such a vaccine could be produced and tested, he said, would depend on money and determination.

If the Zika crisis fizzles, hindsight bias might lead people to criticize health authorities for urging pregnant women not to travel to affected areas, and for funneling money into improving mosquito control and vaccine development. But these are the right actions given what’s currently known. Russell said the typical pattern for this type of outbreak is a peak and then a decline. But without a vaccine, he added, “it’s not going away.”

The Denver Post,Weed goes wide: The subtle mainstreaming of cannabis in Colorado,"Like countless commuters in Denver’s urban core, Marty Otañez can’t help but smell the pot smoke as he rides to work along the Cherry Creek bike path downtown.

“A couple years ago it was only under the bridge at Colfax and Speer,” Otañez said of the clouds emanating from public tokers. “Now it’s pretty much every 100 meters.”

Increased pot smoke swirling around city streets and parks is one of the most recognizable effects of Amendment 64 — which legalized the recreational use and sale of marijuana in Colorado — particularly since public consumption remains illegal.

At concerts, from Red Rocks Amphitheatre to the Pepsi Center, it’s something of a foregone conclusion, no matter how aggressively the staff attempts to prevent it. (Promoter AEG Live Rocky Mountains, which frequently books shows at Red Rocks and the Pepsi Center, declined requests for comment.)

But there are smaller, less in-your-face ways that show how marijuana has become woven into the fabric of daily life in Colorado.

Otañez, a cultural anthropology professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, teaches a class titled Cannabis Cultures. His 13 students examine different aspects of legal weed, from the social effect of decriminalization to using cannabis tea as a stress reliever.

“We’re really well placed to see culture in the making here,” Otañez said. “It’s this pioneering moment between normalization and the residual effects of prohibition. All of Denver is a laboratory.”

Pot-related books plentiful

The sheer omnipresence of cannabis culture — from the dozens of green-emblazoned pot-shop signs around town to flashy, colorful ads for vape pens and bongs — has worked to erode the novelty and stigma of smoking pot.

But so has watching the rise of marijuana-related titles at public libraries — the bastions of approved knowledge for the masses.

“We’re seeing more interest in quality, vetted books about cooking, growing and social issues surrounding marijuana,” said Chris Henning, marketing manager for Denver Public Library system, citing a 35 percent circulation increase in pot-related titles over 2014.

The Denver Public Library bought double the number of marijuana books in 2015 over 2014, he said, which is why “The Cannabis Kitchen Cookbook” recently showed up on the featured shelf at the Woodbury branch in the Highland neighborhood.

“We’ve gotten no complaints about it,” said an employee, who asked not to be identified. “Mostly (complaints) come from sex stuff, religious stuff. But marijuana? We were sort of expecting some and it never happened.”

On the other end of the spectrum, the erosion of stereotypes has created opportunities in high-risk healthcare, said Adrienna Lujan, executive director of the Denver nonprofit Geronimo Enterprises.

“Now that cannabis is legal, people don’t have to live in some kind of shame or stigma, which allows us to explore alternatives,” said Lujan, a certified addictions counselor who trains community health workers in HIV and intravenous drug-addict treatments.

Those alternatives include using marijuana as a withdrawal buffer for heroin, Oxycontin and crack.

“From a public health standpoint, it’s not just a replacement for another addiction but a way to reduce the harm of it,” she said. “Legalization has made people feel safer talking about that even being an option, not only for general public but service providers as well.”

“Trying to pave a path”

The normalization of pot culture is a quest that goes back decades, seen most notably in the name of the country’s oldest, largest pro-pot nonprofit, NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws), which was founded in 1970.

But while “normal” means something different to everyone, Colorado has already made room for a pot-smoking Bible-study group in Centennial ( profiled in a recent New York Magazine article), stoner poker nights, cooking classes, dinner parties and even Colorado Symphony Orchestra events.

“As public acceptance changes and federal laws change, this need to hide use is fading,” said Brett Davis, CEO of the Denver-based startup Social MMJ.

Davis has organized a Sushi and Joint Rolling class, Munchie Crawl (a pot-pub crawl) and, most recently, a Tacky Light Tour that allows people to smoke on a tour bus while surveying Denver’s kitschiest Christmas displays.

The current state of pot consumption — which stipulates it can only be used on private property with the owner’s consent — complicates normalization, but also provides opportunities for businesses such as his.

“People will pay $60 or $70 to attend an event like the (Tacky Light) tour because there’s nowhere else to smoke socially,” Davis said. “We’re trying to pave a path here. We’re not seeing the increase of traffic accidents, fatalities, robberies or all these other fears people had about legalizing pot, and that’s opening this door.”

While industry groups and marketing firms work to sell cannabis to skeptics and newcomers, seeing Colorado’s culture in action is a deciding factor for many visitors.

“I was shocked,” said Nancy Bena, of Baltimore, who spent her 69th birthday in Denver last month after buying a package deal from Denver-based My420Tours. “I was expecting a party atmosphere, and people walking around town all out of it, but it was very professional.”

My420Tours leads anywhere from 120 to 200 visitors per week to grow operations and other cannabis businesses, allowing them to discretely sample product (on a private bus) and connecting them with hotel rooms.

Danny Schaefer, chief operating officer, has watched the business double quarterly and expects My420Tours’ revenues to exceed $2 million this year.

“It’s still a novelty to people who aren’t from here,” Schaefer said.

However, visiting the Mile High City shows that cannabis is integrated into daily life here, he said.

Schaefer even cited a handful of people who, within days of their trip, decided to buy a home in Colorado to bask in the legal marijuana culture.

Baltimore resident Bena hasn’t gone quite that far. But she is already planning on spending her 70th birthday in Denver.

“I’m taking a plane and flying out as fast as I can,” she said. “Colorado has already done all the groundwork.”

Why are you running for office?

Our family has called Jefferson County home for 24 years. It’s a great place to raise a family, start a business, enjoy the outdoors or retire. As the gateway to the Rockies, Jeffco offers a quality of life that’s unmatched. As a community, our values and choices directly impact our quality of life.

I’m running for commissioner to improve lives and build opportunities across our county. I’ll work to attract well-paying jobs, address housing and transportation needs, protect open space, support our fast-growing aging population and veterans, advocate for our nationally recognized libraries and promote safe, healthy communities where everyone thrives.

Effective leadership requires active listening. I’ll seek out diverse perspectives and find workable solutions. My success as a former Jeffco School Board president, business owner and nonprofit leader hinged on these skills. I’ll put my 30 years of professional and community experience to work for Jeffco and I ask for your vote. (Please don’t stop at the top of your ballot when you vote! You’ll find this important countywide race – and others – toward the bottom of your ballot.)

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent(s)?

For me, the best policy solutions are the result of taking the time to listen to all points of view and identify common ground. Some of my top policy priorities include:

• Attract good jobs and promote workforce readiness. Jeffco’s economic vibrancy is a top priority. Some of the country’s most innovative companies call Jeffco home. Let’s continue to sharpen our competitive edge in aerospace, aviation, outdoor recreation and other sectors. As county commissioner, I’ll work with business, county and education leaders to attract good-paying jobs and promote a career-ready workforce with the help of apprenticeships for in-demand jobs like construction and STEM. Jeffco Schools also is a driver of economic development and a collaborative working relationship between commissioners and the district is important to prepare our future workforce and enhance our quality of life.

• Ensure thoughtful, balanced growth that preserves what we love most about Jeffco. Our county is a great place to live, work and play. As more families and businesses move here, we must find innovative ways to guide smart growth, address affordable housing and preserve open space — all while reflecting community values, balancing property rights and advancing the county’s long-term financial health. I’ll fight to ensure aging adults, teachers, first responders, young families and others are not priced out of our community.

• Promote safe communities. We want to feel safe in our homes and neighborhoods. My aunt is a retired Sheriff’s Deputy from California and my uncle was a detective for the Chicago Police Department. My nephew is a firefighter in Kentucky. I understand the importance of supporting our first responders so they can effectively serve our community. Public safety, fire mitigation and emergency preparedness are key. We also want our children to be safe in school. When I served on the Jeffco School Board, I supported the creation of the Frank DeAngelis Center for Community Safety – a one-of-its-kind training center for first responders that’s garnered national attention. I’m proud to have the endorsements of both the West Metro and Arvada Firefighters’ Associations and to be a 2018 graduate of the Jeffco Sheriff’s Citizens’ Academy. As a community, we must work together to prevent elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, human trafficking and opioid abuse as well as address the need for greater mental health and substance treatment.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent(s)?

We both agree that Jeffco is a great place to live! We’ve raised our children here.

What is your position on growth, and how would you address issues regarding growth if you are elected?

Many of us live in Jeffco because we enjoy what it offers – from beautiful hiking trails to energetic downtowns to sweeping Rocky Mountain views to arts and culture to great schools and libraries. Our diverse geography offers a unique mix of urban, rural and mountain living. As more families and businesses move here, we must find ways to thoughtfully and strategically address growth, while balancing property rights and sustaining the county’s long-term financial health. County commissioner hearings on these issues should be fair and impartial, encourage input from citizens and provide factual, understandable information.

Denver Post Voter Guide

Read all of The Denver Post’s election coverage — including stories, endorsements and candidate Q&As — in our 2018 Voter Guide.



Jeffco’s Comprehensive Master Plan (CMP) recognizes that good planning means considering a variety of factors when making land use decisions, including the type of development; physical constraints such as flood plains and wildfire hazards; community impact (air, light, odor); infrastructure needs; and environmental stewardship, such as wildlife habitat and water quality. I have attended the county’s recent open houses on land use and development, which are designed to gather citizen input on the plan and identify priority issues.

Proactive, on-going listening is critical, as is effective, two-way communication to keep our community well informed. We also must stay nimble as we address changing community needs.

How would you address the issue of affordable housing?

A recent poll released by Colorado Mesa University and the Denver Metro Chamber notes that housing costs are a major challenge statewide. Jeffco is no exception.

The average monthly rent in Jeffco is $1,371, according the Jefferson County Housing Authority. In order to afford it, an individual must earn an hourly wage of $26.37 or more than $50,000 annually. A beginning Jeffco Schools’ teacher makes $39,923. A county customer service representative takes home about $32,000.

I have talked with business owners in our mountain communities – some of whom have told me that the lack of workforce housing is having a negative impact on their businesses. Workers can’t afford to live in the communities they serve. Employers, in turn, must invest even more in employee recruitment and training.

As county commissioner, I’ll work with community members, housing experts, builders, nonprofit leaders, elected officials and others to determine what strategies make the most sense from community to community. I’ve met with county and local housing leaders to better understand our county’s unique challenges and learn more about how other communities are tackling this issue.

Among some of the strategies I’d explore further as a commissioner:

• Conduct an inventory of county and state-owned property (this would not include open space) to see if there are any opportunities to address housing needs.

• Engage the community more deeply on these issues by holding a series of county-wide conversations on housing issues.

• Convene a diverse group of leaders to strengthen county-wide partnerships to address housing solutions.

Today, 4,000 people are on the wait list for affordable housing in Jeffco. We know that access to decent, safe housing helps provide stability for vulnerable families with children and helps prevent homelessness.

What is the county’s role in addressing transportation challenges?

None of us likes to sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic. We would prefer to spend less time in the car and more time with our family and friends. Like other metro area counties, Jeffco has transportation challenges due to a growing population and a failure statewide to keep pace with $10 billion in needed investments in transportation infrastructure. Whether you commute by car, bike, light rail or bus, it’s important to have transportation options.

Collaboration with partners such as local municipalities, Colorado Department of Transportation, RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments, Jeffco’s Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport and neighboring counties is key.

One example is the WestConnect Coalition – a partnership of local governments and others working on major transportation issues. The coalition recently released its Planning and Environmental Linkages Study to identify transportation alternatives as well as proposed improvements along C-470 (from Kipling and I-70) and along US 6 and CO 93 – the corridor between Golden and Boulder. The effort is focused on reducing congestion, improving safety and addressing future transportation needs. Further environmental study and preliminary design have been funded for C-470. Work also continues on the Jefferson Parkway; the RFQ was released in September to design, build, finance and operate the parkway.

Another working group has come together to address increasing safety concerns and congestion on US 285, which has placed greater strain on limited resources provided by Elk Creek Fire Dept. in Conifer.

These collaborations – along with others – underscore the importance of working together to improve the ease of traveling. County commissioners play a critical leadership role in convening groups to address these issues and find innovative solutions.

Additional challenges remain. After long delays, many of us are excited to see testing get underway on the G-Line, which runs through Arvada and Wheat Ridge. Recent reductions in bus service from Evergreen and Conifer to the Federal Center Light Rail stop have raised concerns for members of our mountain communities.

How should your county address the opioid addiction crisis? Should needle exchange programs or safe-injection sites be part of the discussion?

Opioid addiction is a significant public health concern and the impact of this crisis is devastating for those addicted and their families. Currently, Jeffco ranks fourth in Colorado in the number of deaths related to drug overdoses. First responders now carry Narcan to reverse opioid overdoses, saving lives.

The Jeffco Public Health Department is working hard to better educate providers, build capacity to address the opioid crisis and collaborate county-wide on solutions. One of our challenges is the lack of peer specialists. They help connect those with an addiction to treatment options and those in recovery to additional support, potential employers and housing specialists. I would back efforts to explore grant funding or other avenues to fill this gap of much-needed services. I recently attended a conference called End Overdose Jeffco, which convened nearly 100 healthcare experts, county specialists and elected officials, and I later sat down with Jeffco Public Health’s Opioid Initiatives Program Coordinator to learn more.

Jeffco Public Health’s Points West program allows individuals to acquire clean injection supplies and helps to decrease improper disposal of used syringes. Points West also provides referrals to mental health support and primary care providers as well as overdose prevention education and testing for HIV/Hepatitis C. Those who participate in the program are assessed by staff. The program has seen success stories, but it’s hard to track data because some individuals are homeless or use an alias. Federal law prohibits safe injection sites. One of our biggest – and urgent – issues in Colorado is that we simply don’t have enough capacity to address treatment. I’m committed to working on these issues with our community, mental health specialists, healthcare professionals, law enforcement and other partners.

Why are you running for office?

As a longtime resident of Jefferson County, I know Jeffco is a great place to live, to work, to raise our families and to start or grow a business. I decided to run for this open Jefferson County Commissioner seat because we have a responsibility to keep Jeffco great. And we continue to do that by having strong, committed leaders at the County level, who will serve with honesty and integrity.

Jeffco has a multimillion dollar budget and requires a firm hand to ensure that the agency stays on track and on budget. Prioritizing budget expenditures is important and balancing that with the needs of the entire constituency is key; identifying the “needs” vs. the “wants” is critical. Underlying all that is a sincere desire to understand the role County government plays in the provision of those services and asking whether an expenditure is within the authority of the government to do so. The proper role of county government is to keep our citizens safe, protect our Constitutional liberties, carefully manage growth, build and maintain core infrastructure such as roads, and defend our property rights. Having a laser focus on these underlying principles ensures government remains on track and on mission.

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent(s)?

Taxes and fiscal responsibility

In only seven months as Jeffco County Commissioner, I have actually reduced taxes on Jeffco residents and small businesses via the elimination of the Business Personal Property Tax, prioritized the budget, and protected our Taxpayer Bill of Rights. In contrast, my opponent, as President of the Jefferson County School Board, repeatedly voted to increase taxes on Jeffco residents by millions of dollars. As there is no mention of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights anywhere on her website, it is unlikely that she defends it as I do.

Advocacy for Public Charter and Vocational Schools

I am a passionate advocate for all forms of public schools, including Public Charter Schools and vocational schools. It is a parent’s responsibility to educate their children and, as taxpayers, should have options. Although states that she is in favor of “good education”, she (while President of the Jeffco School Board) has repeatedly voted to keep charter schools out of Jefferson County, thus eliminating parents options.

Transparency

You know what I stand for. I am open, transparent and honest about who I am and what I stand for. I am well-reasoned and, as a result, am able to provide real answers and a policy path to get there. My opponent advocates for “good stuff” with no discernible way to get there.

I’ve worked hard to bring a calm and measured demeanor to the Board because drama and partisan bickering have no place in County Government. There is too much important business to be conducted and wasting time with partisan politics is unnecessary and unproductive. For all of us, time is money and getting things done in an efficient and timely manner enriches our quality of life.

While it is impossible to agree 100% with everyone all the time, I am a problem solver and work hard to find a path to a winning resolution – for everyone. When not in agreement with others, I am careful to articulate the reasoning why, and seek to find common areas of agreement to advance County issues for the betterment of the Jeffco taxpayer.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent(s)?

I don’t know. I know what I stand for however, my opponent‘s policy prescriptions are vague descriptions of good goals. For example, we all want better roads; my opponent doesn’t articulate a policy or direction to achieve that. We both want a good economy; my opponent states she will “work” with people.

What is your position on growth, and how would you address issues regarding growth if you are elected?

Jefferson County has one of the most Comprehensive Master Plans in the state. While it is not the mandate to do so, it is a comprehensive, carefully considered, citizen participated in Plan to alleviate the effects of urban sprawl and to allow for careful, controlled growth in Jefferson County. We DO need to maintain the character of the communities that we live in while allowing others to live here, too. Jeffco residents should not have the mindset that “I have mine, now I’m shutting the door behind me.

It is not county government’s role to provide new housing. Nor is it county government’s role to stand in the way of new housing. Rather, our role should be to allow the private sector to fulfill the market demand for housing and to allow property owners to realize the value of their property through development. Some of the improvements I believe we can make in that regard are:

Streamline the permitting process

Time is money and reducing permitting time is critical. For most housing developments, Jefferson County maintains an efficient process, usually 6 months. More is being done to streamline and speed up the permitting process. As mentioned above, Jefferson County is in the process of reviewing all its building and planning and zoning codes and reviewing fees.

Housing Development options

Residential housing is not the only form of housing that can and should be considered. Residential housing alone will not sustain this County. It is the balance of commercial and business property development that has allowed Jefferson County to thrive.

Provide a predictable, sleek process to allow the market to make development decisions. This process includes guidance from the Comprehensive Master Plan, which is in the process of being revised thru a series of public meetings. The process is estimated to take about 3 years to complete. In the interim, laying the groundwork for a vibrant and affordable housing market is imperative.

How would you address the issue of affordable housing?

The real problem is one of supply and demand. A big demand, with a relatively little supply creates a scarcity that drives housing prices up. As County government, we can reduce red tape and streamline the process of getting more housing in place – and more housing means a lower cost of housing for all our new neighbors in Jeffco. As mentioned above, the review of the permitting and zoning process has begun. What is relevant in this review is asking whether or not the action in question really even needs to be permitted. If it does (for safety or health reasons), is the fee charged fair? Permit fees should not be a revenue generator for the County, but should accurately charge for the administrative time and effort necessary to conduct that business, nothing more.

I am not in favor of government subsidized housing. That has been tried over and over and has failed.

That being said, I do recognize that there are limited instances where government subsidized housing is appropriate, but that should be limited to those truly in need and not as a “band aid” solution for all.

Alternative forms of housing (e.g. tiny homes) are also being explored and I am in the initial phases of gathering information. This is not to everyone’s taste, but it may provide an option for some. Jeffco’s innovative Planning and Zoning Dept. is providing out-of-the box ideas for possible implementation of this type of development and its feasibility will be determined in the next few months.

What is the county’s role in addressing transportation challenges?

Local

Finish the Jefferson County Parkway. The Parkway would complete the loop surrounding Jefferson County and provide connectivity to the entire county – with no federal funding. Additionally, the impending construction/repairs to the I70 corridor will further complicate traffic and the completion of the Parkway would provide an alternative route.

Jeffco is suburban and keeping Jeffco roads in good repair is an awesome undertaking – 3600 total maintained lane miles, 2900 lane miles of paved roadway and 700 lane miles of gravel roadway. Prioritizing the repairs on these roads should be paramount.

Regional and State

The operation and maintenance of our roads need to be the primary emphasis. Transportation for the foreseeable future will be private vehicles. There is no compelling data that determines whether public transportation attracts enough riders to reduce congestion.

The 2014 FasTracks ballot initiative passed overwhelmingly and the majority of public transportation infrastructure has been built. Changing the region’s mind about the use of public transportation is another matter, and while multi-modal transportation should be encouraged, it should be not favored to the neglect of our roads.

Jefferson County is the 4th largest county in the state and, as such, is important to the rest of Colorado. When Jeffco Commissioners talk, the legislature listens and Jeffco should continue to be the leader in advocating for the prioritization of road repairs and reducing congestion, not only on the county level, but the state, as well.

How should your county address the opioid addiction crisis? Should needle exchange programs or safe-injection sites be part of the discussion?

Jefferson County is taking action regarding Opioid abuse and has joined with over a dozen Colorado local governments in pursuing litigation against manufacturers and distributors of prescription opioids. This effort is led by the City and County of Denver.

Litigation is only one factor in alleviating this complex epidemic and the local governments will continue to pursue additional strategies and activities to reduce the spread of this crisis. Jeffco Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the Sheriff’s Dept. and District Attorney’s Office is working to make services available to those in need of combating substance abuse. Jeffco Public Health recently hosted an exhibition and information event to highlight the dangers of opioid abuse.

There has been a great deal of discussion regarding needle exchanges and safe-injection sites. These have not shown to assist in the problem, but, in reality, facilitate the addiction.

Education of substance abusers and the general public (e.g. – what do to in case of an overdose) is ongoing and I believe has more of an effect on reducing fatalities than needle exchanges and safe-injection sites.",10/10/2018
The Denver Post,"Writer and AIDS activist Larry Kramer turns 80, HBO airs documentary","NEW YORK — He refuses to go quietly into that good night. Larry Kramer continues to rage.

The playwright and activist turned 80 on Thursday, and neither recent illness nor the glow of a new marriage has softened the urgency of his demands.

“There’s so many things I still want to do and there are so many fights still to win. I try to concentrate on that,” he said recently in his Manhattan apartment. “The fight’s never over.”

Kramer, who wrote “The Normal Heart” and founded the advocacy group ACT UP, is angry that AIDS infection rates aren’t falling and there’s still no cure, even as diseases such as Ebola grab headlines.

“No one is talking about AIDS. It’s been 35 years, this plague, and we still don’t have as much to fight it as we should have,” he says. “Right now AIDS is worse than ever before.”

His fiery temper, which roused thousands to protests in the early years of the epidemic, is part of a new HBO documentary airing at 9 p.m. Monday that offers an intimate look at the crusader.

“Larry Kramer in Love & Anger” shows Kramer from his troubled relationship with his father to his suicide attempt at Yale, from his divisive 1978 novel “Faggots” to his role in both the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP.

“The one nice thing that I seem to have acquired, accidentally, is this reputation of everyone afraid of my voice,” he says with a smile. “So I get heard, whether it changes anything or not.”

Director Jean Carlomusto has known Kramer since 1986 and wasn’t afraid to show his irascible side. She admits there have been times when she has wanted to scream at Kramer, but she also credits him with teaching her how to fight back.

“Larry has a very strong sense of justice. If something is wrong, he’s going to say that. He’s going to scream it in the face of whoever he feels is the evil-doer. That’s very much programmed into Larry,” she says.

Among the film’s highlights is rare access to Kramer’s hospital room in 2013 when he got married to his longtime partner, David Webster, while recovering from complications following a liver transplant.

The moment is bittersweet: The legendary gay rights activist finally gets to celebrate his union legally, but is so sick that he can’t sign his name. He had planned to exchange vows on his balcony but was knocked into a stupor two days before the event.

“It certainly wasn’t the wedding present one wanted to share,” he says. Pointing to his head, he adds: “I’m just grateful the old thing still works, because evidentially it didn’t for a while.”

If you expected Kramer to now be relaxing in post-wedding bliss, think again. There’s bureaucratic red tape to scream about and outbreaks of HIV to worry about and regulations that must be updated.

“I’m married,” he says. “But that’s only part of where we are. AIDS is still decimating us and we still don’t have protection under the law.”

Kramer, whose modest apartment overlooking Washington Square Park is crammed with books and medical equipment, is, not surprisingly, hard at work.

He has a deal with HBO to write a sequel to “The Normal Heart” and he’s working on a companion to the 775-page “The American People, Volume 1: Search for My Heart.”

“Work keeps Larry going. He’s a man with a mission, to say the least,” says Carlomusto, the director of the Television Center at Long Island University.

Perhaps Kramer’s last big mission is to retell — he would probably prefer the word reveal — the history of America to include the missing gay people.

Volume 1 of his magnum opus — billed as a novel — claims George Washington was gay. So, too, Kramer believes, were Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln, among many others.

“We have to know our history,” he says. “It isn’t taught. I wanted to write a history of America putting gay people in all along and what happened to us.”

The first volume was 40 years in the making, but Kramer isn’t scared to jump into a second. “Oh, God, yes. Let’s hope I can live long enough,” he says.",25/06/2015
The Denver Post,"For LGBT couples, retirement becomes a financial and legal minefield","For Kathy Murphy, the difference between being gay or straight is $583 a month.

Retirement should have been a “slam dunk,” the 62-year-old Texas widow says. She saved, bought a house with her spouse and has a pension through her employer.

But Murphy’s golden years have not been as secure as they should have been. She is missing out on thousands of dollars a year in Social Security benefits simply because she was married to a woman, not a man.

Murphy fell into a loophole in Social Security that denies survivor benefits to same-sex couples depending on what state they live in. Had Murphy and her wife, Sara Barker, lived next door in New Mexico, a state that does recognize same-sex marriage, this wouldn’t have been an issue.

“If I had been straight, getting widow’s benefits would have been a slam dunk,” Murphy says. “I never thought I would live to see same-sex marriage, but the government still minimizes my marriage and my relationship of 32 years.”

Murphy could be thought of as just one of the many baby boomers who are not prepared for retirement. But while the group overall is not ready to stop working, gay boomers face challenges that make them even more vulnerable, experts say.

For many, decades of workplace discrimination impaired their earning power. The AIDS crisis caused lasting financial and psychological damage, particularly for gay men. And legal pitfalls within Social Security, the cornerstone in any senior’s financial planning, have left gay boomers ill-equipped for retirement.

Same-sex couples in general are likely to have saved far less for retirement than their straight counterparts, according to an exclusive analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The center is jointly operated by The Associated Press and NORC, a leading research center at the University of Chicago.

The median retirement savings for a same-sex couple is roughly $66,000, while straight married couples have roughly $88,000, according to the data, which looks at the finances of straight and same-sex couples aged 19 to 95 going back to 2001.

This data, as well as other studies, show that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults tend to be poorer, in worse health, and most often, alone — with no family to care for them when they reach old age.

“In the aging world, there has been little regard for even the existence of LGBT older people, let alone their particular social and financial needs,” says Michael Adams, executive director of SAGE, a national organization focused on social services and advocacy for LGBT seniors.

When financial firm Prudential asked LGBT adults aged 25 to 68 last year if they were “well prepared” for retirement, only 14 percent said they were, compared with 29 percent of the total population.

And in a sad irony, many of the aging pioneers of gay rights are too old to reap the retirement benefits from the marriage laws they championed.

Lower earnings

Gays and lesbians have faced higher unemployment, lower wages and a workplace where discrimination based upon sexual orientation was common. While many corporations have non-discrimination policies now, it is still legal to fire someone for their sexual orientation in 21 states, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Two polls, one by Pew Research in 2013 and one by Gallup in 2012, reached the same conclusion: LGBT individuals were more likely to make less money than their straight peers during their careers. Gay men earned as much as 32 percent less than straight men, according to research by the Williams Institute, a California-based think tank that focuses on LGBT issues.

As a result, gay men and women over 65 are more likely to end up in poverty. Lesbians, who face wage discrimination because of both their gender and sexual orientation, are even more vulnerable.

Being LGBT “just amplifies the financial problems women already face in the workforce,” says Ineke Mushovic, executive director of the Movement Advancement Project, a Denver-based LGBT-focused think tank.

The Gallup poll found that 15.9 percent of gay men over 65 were near or below the Federal poverty line, compared to 9.7 percent of heterosexual men in the same age group. While the Gallup poll showed poverty rates for straight and gay women to be statistically similar, other studies, including a 2009 report by the Williams Institute, showed lesbian couples over the age of 65 were twice as likely to live below the poverty line as opposite-sex couples, and were much more likely to be on public assistance programs such as food stamps.

Married without benefits

Gay couples were only recently extended the core elements of the retirement safety net available to married straight couples: inheritance of a spouse’s Social Security benefits and pensions. But even with the recent expansion of gay marriage, same-sex couples still face discrimination when it comes to benefits.

When a husband or wife in a straight marriage dies, their spouses can typically collect Social Security benefits based on the higher earner’s work history. Not so for many gay spouses. Only widows or widowers in states that recognize same-sex marriage can get that higher income.

Why? Social Security differs from most federal programs in that the law requires it to use individual states’ definition of marriage. That requirement is why the Obama Administration was unable to extend Social Security benefits to all same-sex couples nationwide, even after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act last year. Before then, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriage at all, even in states where it was legal. Domestic partnerships are still unrecognized by the federal government.

In Florida, Arlene Goldberg faces a retirement of significantly less income. When her partner of 47 years, Carol Goldwasser, died in March, Goldberg was denied her wife’s Social Security survivor benefits on the basis that Florida does not recognize same-sex marriage.

Goldwasser’s death certificate said “single, never married,” even though the couple wed in New York in 2011. Had they been living in New York, Goldberg would earn $800 more in monthly benefits.

“The Social Security problems were bad, but the fact they listed Carol as single was the worst possible thing they could have done to me,” Goldberg says.

The State of Florida revised Goldwasser’s death certificate in October to recognize the couple’s marriage, but Goldberg still has not received any Federal benefits.

“The Social Security Administration knows this is a problem, but there is little they can do, because they’re bound to the letter of the law,” says Karen Loewy, a senior attorney at Lambda Legal, a national organization that focuses on legal issues affecting the LGBT community.

In the case of Murphy and Baker, the couple got married in Massachusetts in 2010. Baker died in 2012 and since then Murphy has been unable to collect her wife’s benefit of $583 a month. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Massachusetts since 2003, but it’s not allowed in Texas, and the federal government is required to use the couples’ state of residence to determine benefits.

“I try not to worry about money, but it’s about fairness,” Murphy says.

This isn’t the first time state marriage laws and Social Security has been at odds. The denial of benefits to mixed-race couples was cited by the Supreme Court in 1967, when it struck down laws that barred black and whites from marrying. For gay couples, the state laws that block federal benefits amount to similar discrimination, advocates say.

Government agencies have little understanding of the scope of problems facing the LGBT demographic. The Administration on Aging, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, collects data on aging minority groups such as African Americans, Native Americans and Hispanics, but not on gay individuals. This is important because the federal government allocates money toward specific elderly programs based on these surveys.

The White House has called for legislation to allow same-sex couples to access survivor benefits in all states. It also has asked for an update of the Older Americans Act to authorize data collection on LGBT individuals. However, there has been little momentum in Congress to take up these issues.

“We’re not talking about some fringe benefit here,” says SAGE’s Adams. “Social Security is the most important financial resource for older Americans in this country, and this is just as true for LGBT older Americans.”

The shadow of AIDS

Bill C. was never supposed to reach retirement. Diagnosed with HIV in the late 1980s, he spent three years in and out of hospitals with AIDS-related infections, watching helplessly as dozens of his friends died.

The 67-year-old, who did not want his last name used for fear his HIV status would negatively impact his acting career, chose to live for what moments he thought he had left. He cashed in his retirement savings and bought a waterfront home on Long Island he knew he couldn’t afford. There he thought he’d spend his days sailing, fishing and riding horses until the disease took him.

He nearly died a handful of times, spending much of 1995, 1996 and 1997 in the hospital. He had to shutter his fabric business.

And the dream house where he was supposed to live out the rest of his life? It was taken by the bank in 1995.

Like Bill C., many long-term AIDS survivors interviewed by the AP talked about poor financial decisions they made in the 1980s and 1990s — when they believed they were facing a death sentence — and are now paying for as they enter retirement.

The advent of life-prolonging antiretroviral “cocktail” therapies in the late 1990s helped end that fatalistic outlook, but by then, HIV-positive baby boomers had lost a decade or more of savings time. Those who had cashed in their retirement funds had to start saving again. Those who had AIDS-related infections went on workplace disability, stunting their savings potential.

“A lot of people who had jobs and financial resources before they became sick were then stuck in some relatively permanent status of financial disarray,” says Sean Strub, the founder of POZ, a New York-based magazine focused on the HIV-positive community.

Jim Albaugh is one of these people.

Diagnosed with HIV in 1987, then AIDS in 1990, Albaugh was in and out of hospitals. But after coming back from the brink of death, he faces a different crisis: He can’t work as much as before he was sick and has little savings.

When the 55-year-old former actor does save, “something pops up and it’s gone.” Recently, he says, he was “lucky” to buy a new pair of shoes. Without the public support programs that help him with his New York City rent, he would not be able to get by.

Albaugh has 10 years before he hits retirement age. But when asked about it, he says: “I don’t think about retirement because I don’t believe I will have one.”

He can’t work as much as before and has fallen behind on saving for retirement.

“I was working 40 hours a week and I ended up twice in the hospital,” he says. “It took me a long time to realize I couldn’t work as much as I really wanted.”

Albaugh hopes to wean himself off some public aid programs in the next couple years but acknowledges that he’ll need others, like Social Security disability.

“I’ll work as hard as I can until I can work no more. After that,” he says, his voice trailing off, “I don’t know what I will do.”

Planning tips for LGBT couples

Know local laws

Even though 35 of the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. allow same-sex marriage, LGBT couples still face significant legal hurdles in many areas that could impact their financial well-being. If you’re moving to a state that bans same-sex marriage, make sure you’re financially prepared for the fact that Social Security will not be available for your surviving partner. Inheritance laws also vary from state to state.

Re-check employer policies

Corporate America’s stance on gay rights has changed over the last 15 years, with 91 percent of Fortune 500 companies banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, up from 61 percent in 2002, according to the Human Rights Campaign. For employees of those companies, it means medical coverage, pension and 401(k) inheritance rights are fairly common for same-sex spouses. It’s worth checking your employer’s latest policies.

Get long-term care insurance

Gay couples without children to care for them as they age are likely to need some sort of assisted-living service. Such help is not cheap. A part-time in-home health aide costs around $30,000 a year while a private room at a nursing home could run you as much as $94,000, according to a 2013 survey by John Hancock Life Insurance Co. Those costs are expected to keep rising. Planners recommend long-term care insurance, particularly for people without children.

Double-check documents

Make sure your savings and benefits go to the people you want after you pass away or become disabled. Add your partner to your beneficiary list for your 401(k), life insurance policies and other accounts. If you own property in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage, speak to a financial adviser and lawyer.

Beef up your savings

Put away at least 10 percent of your income each year, or enough to trigger the max company match in your 401(K) plan.

If you can, get married

This may be a big step emotionally, but you’ll save your spouse a lot of financial pain if you marry sooner rather than later, especially if one of you isn’t in good health. Social Security requires couples to be married for at least one year for a surviving spouse to claim benefits.

Ken Sweet, The Associated Press",28/11/2014
The Denver Post,Supreme Court agrees to decide issue of same-sex marriage,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court announced Friday that it will decide a historic question about whether the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live, and whether states are free to limit wedlock to its traditional definition as a union only between a man and a woman.

The court accepted cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, where restrictions about same-sex marriage were upheld by an appeals court in Cincinnati two months ago.

The high court will hold 2½ hours of oral arguments in April and decide the issue by the time the current term ends in June.

The justices ordered that the parties to the cases address two questions in their legal briefs: whether the Constitution requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and whether states must recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states where they are legal.

Advocates have called same-sex marriage the modern era’s most pressing civil rights issue. The court’s action could mark the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public opinion and the nation’s jurisprudence.

“We are thrilled the court will finally decide this issue,” said James Esseks, director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project. “The country is ready for a national solution that treats lesbian and gay couples fairly.”

Those on both sides of the issue agreed that the time had come for the Supreme Court to step in and settle the issue.

“It is time for the 50 million Americans who stood for marriage in 30 states to have their day in court,” said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. He said his group expects “an eventual victory for the democratic process, religious liberty and the cherished institution of marriage, which forms the very bedrock of our society.”

The questions raised in the cases that the court will consider this spring were left open in 2013 when the justices last confronted the issue of same-sex marriage.

A slim majority said at the time that a key portion of the federal Defense of Marriage Act — withholding recognition of same-sex marriages — was unconstitutional and in a separate case allowed same-sex marriages to resume in California.

Since then, courts across the nation — with the notable exception of the Cincinnati appeals court — have struck down state prohibitions on same-sex marriage, many of them passed by voters in referendums.

When the Supreme Court declined to review a clutch of those decisions in October, same-sex marriage proliferated across the country.

Couples may marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. Three in four same-sex couples live in a state where they are allowed to wed, according to estimates by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.

After the court’s announcement Friday afternoon, Attorney General Eric Holder said the Obama administration will file a friend-of-the-court brief asking the justices “to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans.”

The Michigan case involves the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The cases from Tennessee and Ohio concern whether states must recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states where such unions are legal. And Kentucky offers cases that touch on both licensing and recognition.

In the 2013 DOMA case, U.S. vs. Windsor, the decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy said the federal government could not refuse to recognize or provide benefits to people in same-sex marriages that were conducted in states where they were legal.

Dozens of lower-court judges have read Kennedy’s opinion to mean that state bans violate constitutional rights as well. Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote separately in the Windsor case to point out that the decision did not pass judgment on state bans.",16/01/2015
The Denver Post,Pine Creek soccer coach: Smoky Hill players used slurs against student,"AURORA — Two Smoky Hill boys soccer players were disciplined after racial slurs were spewed at a Pine Creek player during a 5A state quarterfinal game last Saturday.

The racial slurs were aimed at senior forward Yaya Cisse, Pine Creek’s leading scorer and a black student from the Ivory Coast, according to Pine Creek coach Ben Corley. Cherry Creek School District spokeswoman Tustin Amole confirmed that an incident occurred during the game.

“One of the backs was saying, ‘Watch the (N-word), watch the (N-word),’ ” Corley said. “Yaya was saying they were making references to Ebola and HIV and calling him a slave.”

According to Amole, one Smoky Hill player was disciplined for making the comments and the other for not reporting it. Neither player was identified nor was the discipline each player received.

“I know for teenagers, sometimes there’s a propensity to trash talk … but obviously there’s a disconnect there in terms of what is appropriate,” Corley said.

The Gazette first reported the story.

Smoky Hill coach Kersten Mullan and athletic director Preston Davis didn’t respond to messages left by The Denver Post. But according to Amole, after the incident, Mullan held a team meeting and told her players that “no game is bigger than personal character and integrity.”

During the game, one of Pine Creek’s players complained to officials about what was being said to Cisse at halftime, Corley said. According to the Colorado High School Activities Association, the officials told CHSAA they didn’t hear anything during the game.

“When the officials don’t hear it, they really can’t do anything about it,” CHSAA spokesman Bert Borgmann said.

At the end of the game — a 4-1 win by Smoky Hill — Corley said when he was comforting a crying Cisse, one of Smoky Hill’s players came up and said, “Hey man, forget all that stuff I was saying, I was joking. I can’t wait to see you in club.”

Corley hopes going public will shed light on curbing this behavior in the future.

“For me, it’s more about trying to speak up about something that’s obviously inappropriate. In 14 years coaching at Pine Creek, that’s the first experience I’ve had with something that blatant when it comes to that racial verbal abuse type stuff,” Corley said.

The Denver Post,Project Angel Heart delivers nutrition to those coping with illness,"Donna Rudman Haber gets a little weepy when she thinks about the hand-decorated paper shopping bag delivered to her door once a week.

Inside is more than just nutritious, frozen meals packed with proteins, veggies and grains.

It’s also her independence, her ability to live on her own with her dog in their Denver loft, as she battles Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

“It’s a godsend,” Rudman Haber said. “Having good, healthy, nutritious food is very important, but you don’t have the energy to do that for yourself. You just don’t.”

Project Angel Heart has been providing food assistance to people with life-threatening illnesses since 1991, preparing and delivering nutritious and nutritionally appropriate meals at no cost to clients.

In 2013, the Denver-based organization served 2,095 clients in the Denver area and Colorado Springs, making more than 45,000 weekly meal deliveries with the help of more than 8,600 volunteers.

The majority of Project Angel Heart clients are coping with cancer, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS or diabetes.

The only requirement is a current diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and documented difficulty preparing or accessing healthy food due to the side effects of treatment or another disability. There are no age or income restrictions.

“We are in essence providing food as medicine,” said Erin Pulling, CEO of Project Angel Heart. “Clients report that they are better able to adhere to their health care regimens, they’re better able to live independently and they’re better able to afford health care.”

In the Project Angel Heart kitchen, professional chefs work hand in hand with an army of volunteers to prepare a varied menu for roughly 1,000 clients per week.

The majority of clients receive once-weekly frozen meal deliveries — five entrees with vegetables, along with soup, bread and a dessert or two.

About two-thirds also require diet modifications of some sort, whether it’s nut-free, “naked” with no seasonings, or low in sodium, phosphorus and potassium (for those with end-stage renal disease), Pulling said.

A recent menu, posted on a large board in the kitchen, featured roast chicken with sauteed mushrooms, Lebanese-style beef with yogurt sauce, chicken sauce piquant, lemon pepper fish and Ethiopian stew.

The idea is to provide restaurant-quality cuisine, not just sustenance, executive chef Jon Emanuel said.

“Part of what we deliver besides food is dignity, is love,” Emanuel said.

Rudman Haber, for one, is a fan of the roast pork, as well as the wide variety of vegetables and grains that arrive week after week.

She has been receiving Project Angel Heart meals since April, referred by the Colorado Blood Cancer Institute.

And after going through chemotherapy, a stem-cell transplant and radiation, she is slowly regaining strength, she said. For months, she couldn’t walk. She hasn’t been in a wheelchair since March.

“I’m concentrating on getting stronger and rebuilding my stamina,” Rudman Haber said. “I don’t have to worry about food.”

The Denver Post,"Drug-addicted, dangerous and licensed for the operating room","Dr. Joely Nelson slumped from a living room chair onto a pillow on the hearth of the fireplace, her face scorched from the heat, her dead body riddled with drugs. A fellow anesthesiologist found her there after Nelson, 44, failed to show up for work at a Vail Valley Medical Center facility. He said she was depressed, upset about having a long-term disease and had killed herself.

Avon police and a medical examiner agreed that she died, probably intentionally, of a drug overdose. The hospital’s safety manager told police she doubted the syringes and pills around her could have come from Vail Valley.

But a hospital report to the state showed Nelson had removed fentanyl, a powerful narcotic, and another drug illegally. The autopsy found cocaine and narcotic drugs in her blood. She died with old and new puncture marks in her legs.

So how did the Vail hospital inform the public about the death of a drug-addicted anesthesiologist in February 2014?

It didn’t. As in hundreds of other drug-theft cases, hospital patients never learn if someone who treated them was involved.

Other hospitals can be left uninformed as well. Colorado hospitals from Craig to Englewood have been duped by applicants with a history of drug addiction.

In Colorado, hospital workers who get caught stealing powerful narcotics often aren’t reported to police or to federal authorities. Unless the state takes formal action against them, their names don’t show up on licensing disciplinary lists. There is little to keep a small but dangerous number of doctors, nurses and surgical technologists from moving from hospital to hospital, taking with them their addictions and risks to patients.

Even when they get fired, they can keep their licenses — and their histories secret — by promising to enter treatment. In a review of state health, licensing board and police records, The Denver Post found cases in which hospital employees worked for years in Colorado despite recurring thefts and even convictions — sometimes while participating in addiction treatment programs.

Almost always, the thief’s identity is protected.

Hospitals have managed to keep secret the names of employees passed out with needles in their arms and blood on bathroom walls, of staffers who stole hundreds of vials of fentanyl, of nurses leaving patients in pain by stealing their medicine.

In August 2010, a drug-addled staffer at Poudre Valley Hospital passed out while a patient was being put onto the operating table, state records show. At Denver Health Medical Center, a nurse resigned in November 2013 after she was seen with needles, syringes and a tourniquet stuffed in her bag, her pupils constricted after she collapsed on an empty patient bed. She was sent home in a taxi.

All of these cases occurred after Kristen Parker, a Colorado surgical technologist, infected hospital patients with hepatitis in 2008 and 2009 by injecting herself with fentanyl and leaving behind dirty needles.

In a review of 416 state reports on missing or stolen drugs from Colorado hospitals during the last six years, The Post found:

• At least two hospital workers, including Nelson, died of drug use. In January 2010, Amanda Cornstubble, 29, also was found dead in her bed by her parents, a syringe and tourniquet at her side. Police found nine empty vials of hydromorphone in her Denver apartment, the same painkiller that Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver later found she likely stole while working there.

• When hospitals report missing or stolen medicines to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, state investigations often show no calls to police or the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. In 222 confirmed drug diversion cases, hospitals referred just 123 to local police, according to state reports listing facility responses. Only 70 showed a referral to the DEA.

• The Post inquired about 24 egregious cases involving employee syringe use and thefts of multiple drugs from hospitals. Police departments were unable to locate reports in 19 cases, in part because health department reports don’t name offenders.

• Dozens of theft cases involved traveling nurses hired from contract agencies to work at multiple hospitals. In some cases, hospitals simply asked the agencies not to send the nurses back to them.

• Nursing board records show people with felony records and histories of drug addiction still manage to get new jobs in Colorado’s health care system.

• The state health department almost never finds fault with hospital responses — except when reports are late.

“Dirty little secret”

On the streets, the opioid epidemic has turned into a subject of national alarm. Opioid-related deaths have tripled since 2000. In February, President Barack Obama requested $1.1 billion to combat the problem. Black-market dealers have heightened the dangers by lacing heroin with fentanyl, creating an extremely potent but deadly high.

At the same time, the very system designed to treat this epidemic has been struggling with its own drug abuse cases.

“It’s kind of a dirty little secret that has gone on around the country. It’s got to stop,” said John Burke, president of the International Health Facility Diversion Association.

“Often the health facilities don’t report it properly. If they don’t, the person may easily go to another facility and continue their ways,”said Burke, a former police commander who investigated drug thefts at Cincinnati hospitals. “It’s not just the people who did this. There’s a breakdown in supervision.”

This year, surgical tech Rocky Allen caused an interstate uproar after Swedish Medical Center in Englewood reported he stole fentanyl, causing the hospital to offer free blood tests to about 2,900 patients. Allen carries an unidentified bloodborne illness. Patients were tested for HIV and hepatitis.

Allen had been court-martialed for fentanyl theft while stationed in Afghanistan, yet managed to find surgical tech jobs and get fired from hospitals in Washington, California and Arizona before Swedish hired him.

Allen was arrested on federal charges in February and has pleaded not guilty. In March, an agency nurse, Kimberly Burgans, was charged with stealing fentanyl from St. Anthony Summit Medical Center.

Those public disclosures are the exception in Colorado, where hospitals that catch employees with narcotic medicines routinely fire them but rarely inform patients or the public.

Hospitals report drug diversions to the health department, which issues one-page public reports that, under state law, never name the employee even if a drug theft is confirmed. Even other hospitals are not entitled to their names.

The state Board of Nursing tracks disciplinary records by name, not by reporting hospital. Police departments say they can’t always confirm that they handled a call from a hospital without a name and case number.

The upshot: It’s difficult to track how police departments and licensing boards treat hospital employees who commit drug thefts on the job.

The privacy of the perpetrators gets protected even when there are massive drug thefts or evidence that employees have risked patients’ health by injecting themselves with narcotics at work.

The Post succeeded in identifying dozens of health care workers who stole drugs, sometimes repeatedly, by matching drug theft reports the hospitals filed with other public records. But even extensive sleuthing yielded no results in many cases.

In March 2015, for example, Denver Health Medical Center found a registered nurse had locked himself in the bathroom of the staff lounge. He was sitting on the toilet with his head between his legs. A bloody syringe lay in the toilet. The nurse was taken to an emergency room.

Afterward, he admitted he had taken fentanyl from a patient’s IV line and that he had a history of drug diversion. He denied contaminating any patients. Denver police provided a copy of its case report, deleting the hospital employee’s name because the district attorney did not file charges.

In the case of Nelson, the anesthesiologist who died of a drug overdose, Dr. Edgar Downs, a retired dentist, became so concerned that he requested a Colorado Board of Pharmacy investigation, its records show. He thinks Nelson, while severely addicted, injured him during his spinal fusion surgery at Vail Valley Medical Center in late 2013, leaving him with acute pain in his neck that required him to be transferred to an emergency room five times, court records show.

But Vail Valley Medical Center succeeded in getting an injunction in Eagle County from District Judge Russell Granger barring Downs from further disseminating his concerns through the media. The hospital claimed his allegations would cause undue “reputational harm.” When The Denver Post asked to review court records in that case, Granger sealed the case. The Colorado Supreme Court rejected Downs’ appeal of the injunction.

Vail Valley Medical Center declined to discuss Nelson’s death.

Hospitals differ in response

Federal regulations require reporting thefts and significant losses of controlled substances to the DEA. They recommend calling local law enforcement and licensing boards as well. While “significant” is not defined, the regulations urge facilities to “err on the side of caution and report it to DEA and local law enforcement authorities.”

The state reports on drug diversions show hospitals differ greatly in their responses.

From March 2013 to the end of 2015, Swedish Medical Center reported to the state that nine staff members had resigned or been fired for drug diversions. State health department reports indicate that just one case was referred to local police and none to the DEA.

Swedish fired Daniel Morrison after he admitted diverting hydromorphone from May through June 2014 from the hospital while working there as a nurse. But the state health department report shows the hospital didn’t report those thefts to the police or DEA. The hospital did notify the board of nursing, which allowed Morrison’s nursing license to remain active after he entered into drug treatment. He also holds a nursing license in Connecticut.

The Denver Post was able to identify Morrison from a lawsuit questioning the hospital’s drug diversion protocols after Rocky Allen’s arrest. He declined comment.

Swedish questioned the completeness of the state reports.

“We are compliant in our documentation and notification of regulatory and investigative agencies,” said Nicole Williams, the hospital’s spokeswoman.

The state requires hospitals to report missing or stolen drugs electronically. They are asked if they notified police and licensing boards and any “other entity or agency.” Mark Salley, a health department spokesman, said its summary reports on drug diversion investigations could fail to mention hospital calls to the DEA because the state does not specifically require that.

Englewood police said no report on Morrison’s theft was made.

In contrast, Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center in Denver took a much more aggressive stance, reporting even unsubstantiated allegations that included just one missing pill to police. It filed 48 drug diversion reports with the state in the last three years, far more than any other hospital.

The hospital said only five of those investigations confirmed drug diversions. In some cases, the hospital did not confirm a diversion if an employee blood test was negative for unprescribed drugs.

Of the 222 confirmed drug diversions in the state’s hospitals during those six years, hospitals made referrals to all three reporting entities — the DEA, local police and state licensing board — in only 49 cases, according to state health reports.

Hospitals also differed in their approaches to testing employees caught with drugs and needles.

In Fort Collins, Poudre Valley Hospital offered more than 200 patients blood tests in December 2013 when an employee who had been infected with hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease, was suspected of stealing intravenous painkillers.

In Lone Tree, a staff member at Sky Ridge Medical Center in 2013 found a syringe with a needle on a toilet paper roll after a registered nurse left the bathroom.

The nurse tested positive for fentanyl and was fired, but “was not tested for any communicable disease,” according to the state report. Yet the health department found “the facility acted appropriately” and did not question its decision to forgo a disease check.

Treatment over revocation

In 169 of the confirmed drug diversions, hospitals reported the case to the licensing board, which can revoke a nurse’s license to work, state records show.

But the Colorado Board of Nursing gives nurses who steal drugs to feed an addiction a chance at redemption. Nurses addicted to drugs can keep their license if they agree to enter a program that monitors their drug use and treats their addictions.

Shaun Fitzsimmons pleaded with a manager at Denver Health Medical Center to spare his nursing license by letting him enroll in treatment when he admitted to stealing oxycodone during a shift in 2011.

An audit of his drug dispensing at Denver Health determined he removed 485 doses of narcotics, including morphine, over 13 months that could not be accounted for. Hospital officials told police Fitzsimmons likely deprived patients in severe pain of their medications, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug possession charge.

Yet he received no adverse licensing action.

After his arrest, he was hired as a nurse at the Medical Center of Aurora and later moved to California, where he holds a nursing license.

Fitzsimmons said he completed drug treatment and submitted to drug testing and monitoring for nearly four years. He said he’s had no relapse.

“It’s a very, very difficult program,” he said.

Davene Riesmeyer was a repeat offender. The state nursing board allowed her to hold a license despite her being found unconscious in 1993 in a call room at Swedish, fentanyl and other controlled substances coursing through her body.

Riesmeyer relinquished her license after she pleaded guilty to a felony charge of obtaining controlled substances by fraud and deceit. She had tested positive for the use of painkillers in 2000 while employed at Rose.

But in 2006, the nursing board reinstated her license with her promise to enter another drug treatment and monitoring program. Her license remained active despite spotty compliance with drug screening she had promised to do.

In June 2013, Riesmeyer was found unconscious in her car in a parking lot of her health care employer in Arapahoe County. She had injected the anesthetic and sedative Propofol through a catheter she inserted in her arm. She was arrested that same day for driving under the influence and unsafe driving, a criminal charge that resulted in probation.

Riesmeyer reached a final agreement with the board to relinquish her license several months later — 20 years after her first drug theft. She declined to comment.

Only about 60 percent of the nearly 250 nurses in Colorado who annually receive addiction help or other counseling from Peer Assistance Services, the group tasked with rehabilitating them, actually complete the program, state data show. About 10 percent don’t comply with the terms of the program and another 30 percent drop out. Those deemed unsafe to practice nursing are referred to the state nursing board for possible revocation.

“He just lied”

Even when cases are reported to police and criminal charges are filed, it can take months, even years, for the nursing board to take final action.

In March 2012, the Memorial Hospital in Craig fired Richard Dickerson Jr., a registered nurse anesthetist who had just arrived from Kansas. Dickerson had been found incoherent in an operating room standing over the anesthesia cart after administering an IV drug to himself, state records show. He had blood on his clothing and shoes. Blood was splattered on the floor, shower and walls of a bathroom, with syringes on the counter.

Hospital officials notified Craig police, who searched Dickerson’s motel room and found vials of painkillers, syringes and a letter from the Kansas Nurse Assistance Program alerting him that he needed to be monitored due to his recent diagnosis of opioid abuse.

Dickerson then returned to Kansas, where he ran afoul of the law again, this time while working at a hospital there. He was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to drug possession charges. He relinquished his Colorado license in December 2013.

“He just lied on his application,” said Jennifer Riley, a spokeswoman for the Craig hospital.

She suggested that hospitals should be required to notify licensing boards even when an employee agrees to drug abuse treatment because it’s too easy otherwise to conceal the past.

Hospitals often tell employees caught with narcotics that “if you do the treatment, this will not affect your nursing license,” she said.

The Centura Health hospital system has reported at least twice to the state since 2010 that it needed a better way to track drug dispensing by nurses provided by contract agencies at one of its hospitals.

After David Laumeyer, an agency nurse, was busted by police for dealing meth, Centura determined numerous drug dispensing irregularities by him at its St. Anthony North Hospital in Westminster and Parker Adventist Hospital.

Laumeyer’s suspicious drug withdrawals from the hospitals started in 2010. About a year later, after another agency drug theft surfaced at Parker, Centura once again said the tracking of agency nurses still needed to be fixed at that hospital.

Drug diversion remained an issue, though, and Centura promised to the state in June 2015 that it would come up with a comprehensive, standard policy for all of its hospitals for monitoring and reporting drug diversions, which was supposed to take effect that September.

The Burgans case at Centura’s Frisco hospital emerged after that.

In a statement, Centura said its hospitals had separate drug monitoring systems until last year, but they now use the best auditing software on the market.

“We wish we could promise to make diversion attempts go away, but in reality we can promise two things,” Centura said. “Attempts to divert painkillers will continue, and so will the determination of Centura Health to find them and report them.”

Even nurses with felony guilty pleas to drug offenses on their rap sheets continue to find nursing work in Colorado, records show.

Terrala Marie Butler-Perry still had a registered nurse license after pleading guilty twice, in June 2004 and March 2011, to a felony drug charge.

Employed as a director of nursing at Wheatridge Manor Care Center, a nursing home, she showed signs of impairment so severe in October 2012 that her superiors asked her to submit to a drug test. She tested positive for opiates and other controlled substances and was arrested on drug diversion charges again.

The state nursing board revoked her license in February 2014, nearly 10 years after her first guilty plea to a drug charge.

How The Post reported this story:

The Denver Post obtained all reports from Colorado hospitals concerning drug diversions since 2010 from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The newspaper used these reports to build a database showing how many incidents each hospital reported, how many were confirmed as employee or patient drug diversions and how often the state investigative summaries showed calls to licensing boards, police and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

The Post then turned to licensing board, police records and other sources to identify some of the hospital employees who had been fired for drug thefts.",23/04/2016
The Denver Post,Colorado will lead research into pot’s real medical value,"After Coloradans decreed in 2000 that the cannabis plant had medical value, scientific evidence has had to play catch-up with the anecdotal cases.

The list of claims of healing powers of marijuana is long, while the list of full-scale U.S. studies on medicinal benefits is short, largely because pot use is still against federal law and doesn’t get many federal research dollars.

Colorado voters approved themedical use of pot in 2000 and recreational use in 2012.

Now Colorado is leading the nation in state spending on studies of medical marijuana.

The state’s Medical Marijuana Scientific Advisory Council considered Dec. 17 how to spend $9 million set aside by the state legislature for two- to three-year studies on marijuana treatment for chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson’s disease tremors, pediatric epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease and palliative care for pediatric brain tumors.

“You can’t ignore the anecdotal evidence. It’s compelling,” said Dr. Larry Wolk, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “I wouldn’t want to deprive families’ hope or treatment. But medical effectiveness still needs to be verified. With these studies, we could have some answers within the next year.”

There were 116,287 people holding medical marijuana cards in Colorado at the end of September — about 3,400 more than at the end of last year before recreational pot became legal — and 816 physicians with medical pot patients. About 66 percent are male, the average age is 42 and 427 patients are under age 18.

Most patients, 93 percent, are using medical marijuana to treat severe pain. Muscle spasms are the reason given by 15 percent of card holders. Some patients have listed both as a reason.

Conditions recognized for medical cannabis use in Colorado are cachexia (or wasting syndrome), cancer, chronic pain, chronic nervous system disorders, epilepsy and other seizure disorders, glaucoma, HIV or AIDS, multiple sclerosis and other muscle spasticity disorders and nausea.

“It’s unlikely that marijuana is effective for the wide range of health problems approved under Colorado law,” said the University of Colorado’s Dr. Andrew Monte, who co-wrote a viewpoint piece on legalizing marijuana published Dec. 8 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Yet hope and desperation can be stronger than scientific evidence. Colorado has become a beacon for those seeking a marijuana cure for their illnesses and suffering.

Boulder County medical marijuana caregiver Jason Cranford said he and others are flooded with requests from around the country to treat cancer, seizure disorders and countless other conditions in children and adults.

Teri Robnett, with the Cannabis Patients Alliance, was the only non-scientist, non-medical person named to the Medical Marijuana Scientific Advisory Council.

Robnett has suffered 27 years with fibromyalgia, a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue and sleep, memory, mood and digestive issues. In 2009 she began experimenting with cannabis.

“It completely changed my life,” Robnett said. It’s the only thing that’s alleviated her symptoms without serious side effects, she said.

She discerns a recent shift in the medical community’s attitudes toward marijuana. Scientists are less interested in questioning whether it has value as medicine, she said, and more interested in determining just how effective it is and how patients should be dosed.

Studies going back 40 years showed marijuana can be used to treat and prevent glaucoma, an eye disease that increases pressure in the eyeball, damaging the optic nerve and causing loss of vision.

More recent research has found that chemicals in marijuana can lessen the incidence of epileptic and Dravet’s syndrome seizures, alleviate the chronic pain of cancer, arthritis and nerve pain — and may be safer than opioids. It lessens the nausea of chemotherapy and is an appetite stimulant.

Marijuana likely has anti-inflammatory effects and appears to benefit some patients with inflammatory bowel disease, other studies show.

Claims that cannabis limits tumor growth, slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease or eases muscles spasms, alleviating symptoms of multiple sclerosis or the tremors of Parkinson’s, among other conditions, are not substantiated by research, said Monte, who works in CU’s emergency medicine department and with the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center.

Medical professionals point out that smoking or ingesting a plant is not “pharmacological” and that it’s impossible to administer a consistent dose and predict a consistent result.

“Something given in a known and consistent dose, that’s medicine,” Wolk also said. “I’m uncomfortable with a plant as a medical model.”

Medical marijuana generally means the whole unprocessed marijuana plant or crude extracts, which are not approved as medicine by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The National Institutes of Health has funded some investigations into therapeutic uses of plant constituents, THC, CBD and other active chemicals called cannabinoid.

Studies have led to the development of two FDA-approved medications, dronabinol (brand name Marinol), which contains THC, and nabilone (brand name Cesamet), which has a synthetic form of THC. They are used to treat the nausea caused by chemotherapy and the weight loss and muscle atrophy caused by AIDS.

A CBD-based drug called Epidolex has been created to treat certain forms of childhood epilepsy, and clinical trials are underway.

The Denver Post,"For Hillary Clinton, CGIA brings benefits, drawbacks","When the Clinton Global Initiative America roared into Denver a year ago, Hillary Clinton used the high-power conference to plant a flag in the West’s biggest swing state.

Notably, the former secretary of state took a side trip to a Tattered Cover Book Store, a Colorado institution, to sign copies of her memoir “Hard Choices” — one of the many harbingers to her 2016 presidential bid.

But when the three-day summit returns to Colorado’s capital Monday, Clinton won’t be anywhere near the state. Instead, she has plans to attend a fundraiser in a Washington, D.C., suburb to raise money for her White House bid.

Her absence, however, doesn’t mean the conference won’t offer her campaign a boost. Nor will it negate recent criticism that has stalked the Clinton Foundation, which oversees CGI America, and the ties it has with donors from around the globe.

Michael Stratton, a Denver public affairs consultant and longtime Clinton ally, said the conference is a “tremendous platform, particularly as it relates to her being able to get a broader base of people seeing her on the policy versus the political front.”

At the same time, questions about the Clinton Foundation’s foreign donors around and during the time Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state create a potential vulnerability.

In May, a conservative author released the book “Clinton Cash,” which dug deep into the foundation’s finances.

Recent reports have examined links between Clinton Foundation donors and global affairs, including a controversial uranium deal that involved Russian interests, and ties to Qatar and the country’s troubled bid for the 2022 World Cup.

Floyd Ciruli, a Denver-based political analyst, considers the foundation one of Clinton’s “essential tools in what has become a global influence network and billion-dollar quest for the White House.”

The recent suggestions of conflicts of interest and transparency complicate the equation. Nevertheless, Ciruli sees the conference itself as ”

an international schmooze-fest … (that) has been a huge asset for the Clintons and their ambitions.”

Tour of early voting states

Clinton announced her campaign in April but will formally launch the effort Saturday, three days after CGI America ends, with a tour of the early presidential nominating states.

In Colorado, the campaign put a paid organizer on the ground this spring to help mobilize support among volunteer activists. The campaign is hosting house parties in 10 Colorado cities on the day of her official announcement, a spokesman said.

Clinton allies said the candidate is expected to visit Colorado for an event in July, but the details are not final.

“This time it seems that people are really committing themselves to the 2016 election much earlier,” said U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat who helped lead the 2008 Clinton effort in Colorado.

The agenda for the CGI America dovetails with themes Clinton is expected to highlight in her campaign, such as increasing social mobility and the “potential of alternative energy.”

Former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea will headline the conference, but foundation officials and supporters have stressed the event is not connected to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

She resigned from the board when announcing her run.

“There was never any politics discussed. It was all about what good CGI does for people around the country and the world,” said Wellington Webb, a former Denver mayor and friend of the Clintons. “They’ve been very good about keeping the boundaries.”

Webb, who serves on the finance committee for the Ready for Hillary super PAC, said Denver’s selection dates to 1997, when Bill Clinton hosted a summit of eight world leaders in the city — not recent political considerations.

“The Clintons have been coming here many, many years and have a host of supporters here in Colorado,” he said.

Prominent donors

One prominent supporter is CH2M, formerly CH2M Hill, an engineering services firm based in Englewood. It is among the largest benefactors of the Clinton Foundation in Colorado.

According to the foundation, CH2M has donated between $100,001 and $250,000. CEO Jacqueline Hinman also was listed as a participant last year in CGI America.

There’s a political connection, too. During Clinton’s unsuccessful 2008 run, a fundraiser for her campaign was hosted at the Cherry Creek home of Lee McIntire, a former CEO of CH2M.

Asked about the company’s ties to the Clinton Foundation, spokesman John Corsi released a statement that described it as “related to commitment for reconstruction of a community library in New Orleans post-Katrina.”

“We re-engaged in 2013 upon announcement that CGI would be coming to Denver,” Corsi added. “We responded to requests from the community to help support the event, including the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.”

Donors to the Clinton Foundation run the gamut.

Listed among its contributors are philanthropic bigwigs such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, corporate behemoths such as Coca-Cola and ExxonMobil, and even ideological foils, such as the conservative outlet Newsmax Media Inc.

Christopher Ruddy, CEO and editor of Newsmax, defended the Clinton Foundation in a recent opinion piece: “I have never felt the whiff of politics from either its staff or any of its activities.”

Overall, it is estimated the group has raised more than $2 billion from more than 300,000 individuals and organizations. The effort has led to significant gains, according to the Clinton Foundation.

More than 27,000 U.S. schools now are working to prevent childhood obesity, 9.9 million people can buy HIV/AIDS medications at more affordable prices, and 33,500 tons of greenhouse gas emissions are being reduced each year in the United States.

Still, questions about the Clinton Foundation have followed the Democratic front-runner since her entry into the race.

The attention has intensified since the May 5 release of “Clinton Cash” by Peter Schweizer, a former fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution. And Republicans have taken notice.

“As a presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton cannot distance herself from the scandals surrounding her family foundation accepting tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and other questionable donors who were lobbying her State Department while she was Secretary of State,” RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.

An April story in The New York Times examined a uranium deal that coincided with Clinton’s time as secretary of state. It looked at millions of dollars in donations made to the Clinton Foundation by uranium investors.

These same investors were involved in an ultimately successful campaign by the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, to gain control of a company called Uranium One, which runs a mine in Wyoming and is exploring other U.S. sites.

The office of the secretary of state had a role in approving the sale, although the Clinton campaign has described the agency’s impact as minor and that Clinton herself had no involvement.

More recently, news reports have looked at donations to the Clinton Foundation by groups associated with the 2022 World Cup.

The Clinton Foundation has received contributions from FIFA, which oversees the tournament, as well as the organization from Qatar helping ready the country for the 2022 World Cup. That group gave between $250,001 and $500,000.

Top FIFA officials recently were indicated on corruption charges, and the FBI reportedly is investigating how the 2022 bid to Qatar was awarded. The Clinton Foundation has not been mentioned as part of any inquiry. Bill Clinton played a key role in the U.S. effort to land the 2022 tournament.

Meanwhile, the spotlight on the Clinton Foundation could be having an impact on Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers.

Half of all respondents to a national poll released Tuesday said they disapproved of the way Clinton has handled questions about the Clinton Foundation and its fundraising. That compares to 33 percent of Americans who approved of her response, according to the ABC News/Washington Post survey.

Colorado ties to the clinton foundation

The construction firm CH2M, based in Englewood, contributed between $100,001 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Company CEO Jacqueline Hinman also participated last year in CGI America.

A group called Colorado Philanthropy for Early Childhood gave between $100,001 and $250,000. The umbrella organization helped sponsor CGI America in 2014 and includes the Merage Foundations, which were built by David and Laura Merage. The Merages have been prolific political contributors, backing candidates from Democrats Michael Bennet and Mark Udall to Republicans Mike Coffman and Jim DeMint, according to federal campaign filings.

Other CGI America sponsors with Colorado ties include CA Technologies, a New York-based software firm with offices in the state; Freeport-McMoRan Inc., which operates mines globally and in Henderson and Leadville; and Noble Energy, a global energy company with offices in Denver.

The Denver Post,"A month for Alzheimer’s, a lifetime of disease","More than a decade ago, my father stood outside a Denver apartment and wouldn’t get in the elevator because he didn’t know what it was. That was my first clue that something was amiss — and soon after came the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Since then, it’s been a complicated path of understanding the disease and the man he has become, but from that confusion came some clarity.

September was the month set aside to draw attention to this disease. But we need to pay attention to it year-round.

So I’d like to offer the final lessons my father has taught me.

Dementia is a particularly difficult path to death, both for the afflicted and the caregivers, and the road ahead is truly dangerous: An estimated 135 million people worldwide will have dementia by 2050. An honest gaze needs to be directed at the complex ethical, legal, financial, and societal issues this disease raises, but three issues are clear and deserve immediate attention: 1) funding for research, 2) pushing for legislation that will change laws and policies regarding heathcare options and coverage, and 3) reassessing our end-of-life decisions and culture.

Currently, Alzheimer’s research receives $566 million in funding (according to the National Institutes of Health). Research investments in other conditions, such as cancer ($5418M) and HIV/AIDS ($2978M) are paying off. This proven approach should be applied to Alzheimer’s, if for no other reason than Alzheimer’s is the most expensive disease in America. For every $100 that the NIH spends on Alzheimer’s research, Medicare and Medicaid spend $26,500 caring for those with the disease. The Alzheimer’s Association could use our financial support so they can continue to advocate for funding dollars. As the largest national voluntary health organization, they also offer the most on-the-ground services — the Colorado chapter offers over 90 support groups in our state, for instance.

A rethinking of our health care system is needed too. Seventy-five percent of Alzheimer’s patients now receive at-home care, which I believe is not always the best option. A recent New York Times article, “Panel Urges Overhauling Heath Care of End of Life” terrifically outlines the situation, namely that for-profit health care models have made community-based care/services cost prohibitive for most Americans; Medicare provides very little help for the type of care most needed (custodial); and social policy or social insurance has been underexplored. Very few can afford private health care, and those that do end up spending their life savings. We must have a better way of caring for those with dementia.

Finally, we must rethink our approach to death — and embrace it — and make medical decisions accordingly. By the age of 85, 40 percent of us will have dementia. It’s important that we all (doctors and regular folk) learn to say judiciously say no to medical intervention and allow death to happen. Should my father contract pneumonia, for example, my hope is antibiotic not be administered, not because I don’t love him — I love him very much — but because death is a natural part of his life, and continued medical intervention is a denial of that fact. I hope we, as a culture, understand the difference between saving a life and prolonging a dying.

I wish for a lot. I wish my father had stepped in that elevator that day. I wish the disease didn’t exist. I wish cures or effective treatments were on the foreseeable horizon. In absence of all that, though, my hope is that we use this this month for a renewed interest and clarity on this disease and the ethical decisions that surround it, and start now by donating, volunteering, contacting our legislators, and writing out our plans (both legal and personal) for a good death.

Laura Pritchett, PhD, is an American author and Colorado native. Her latest novel, “Stars Go Blue,” is based on her experience with her father.

The Denver Post,"With historic films, why do we put such a premium on fact?","A revered leader of nonviolent civil disobedience. An Olympic wrestler, his brother and an eccentric, ultra-wealthy patron. A World War II codebreaker with an awkward manner and a secret. A genius of space-time physics bound by his betraying body.

Martin Luther King Jr., Mark Schultz, Alan Turing and Stephen Hawking are among the reality-based characters appearing on movie screens currently.

And although they have been depicted as fascinatingly flawed or achingly human, as beset with doubt yet tempered by the courage their moment demands — in other words, compelling movie protagonists — they have elicited responses that have called into question the veracity of the films they appear in. In December, Mark Schultz began waging a mildly unhinged Twitter campaign against “Foxcatcher” director Bennett Miller.

“Everything I’ve ever said positive about the movie I take back. I hate it. i hate it. i hate it. I hate it. i hate it. i hate it. I hate it,” he tweeted, after reviews of the movie focused on the homoerotic tension in his relationship to coach and patron John du Pont, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

This month’s controversy concerns Ava DuVernay’s civil rights drama, “Selma.” Last week, The New York Times ran a piece on its front page titled “Depiction of Lyndon B. Johnson Raises Hackles.” Much of the dispute concerns the accuracy of the prickly interactions between King and President Johnson prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

And though the pedigree of the detractors is impressive, the criticisms strike a familiar chord. That never happened. That character didn’t even exist. That meeting didn’t take place, at least not that way. He was more comfortable with his sexuality than the movie asserts. And so it goes.

When it comes to art, it seems, there is truth and there are facts. And while I won’t go so far as to say “never the twain shall meet,’ ” they often have a complicated relationship on the big screen.

At no time in the movie calendar is this so true as awards season. Now’s the time when “serious” films taking their cues from actual people and events vie for moviedom’s biggest prizes — and also get the once-over twice for dramatizing real life.

Mining history

Tonight, four of the five films competing for the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama are based on real events: “Foxcatcher,” “The Imitation Game,” “Selma” and “The Theory of Everything.” (And let’s not forget “Pride.” The British indie comedy about a collective of gay activists who donated money to wary striking coal miners in the mid-1980s has a berth in the best musical or comedy category.)

Come early morning Thursday, a few of these are sure to become best-picture contenders when the nominees for the Academy Awards are announced. And because the Oscars contest has many as 10 slots available for best-picture nominees, a couple more movies could nudge their way into the race: “American Sniper,” Clint Eastwood’s film about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle; and, less likely, Angelina Jolie’s “Unbroken,” about Olympic runner and WWII prisoner of war Louis Zamperini. (ABC will broadcast the Oscars live Feb. 22.)

Stay tuned for next week’s stir about the Kyle flick. Former Minnesota Gov. and Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura’s lawsuit against Kyle’s estate and his publisher is back in the news as the Eastwood film makes its way into multiplexes.

As movies take the biopic route more and more, ruminations about how close they hew to the facts of subject and era have become part of the annual awards rite, too.

Often the truth-fiction divide has been used to tarnish a contender’s chances for the Oscar. “Oscar Voting Begins As Controversy Erupts Over Accuracy Of ‘Selma’ “ was the headline from savvy industry site deadline.com.

For more than a decade, the movie biz has binged on the award-season dish of the real and the fabricated. In 2000, front-runner for best actor Denzel Washington lost ground as character Rubin “Hurricane” Carter was picked apart. The winner that year: Russell Crowe for his turn as Maximus in “Gladiator.” The next year, Crowe’s seeming lock on Oscar waned in a swirl of rumors about Nobel Prize winner John Nash’s anti-Semitism. That year’s winner: Denzel Washington for his turn as Detective Alonzo Harris in “Training Day.”

Yes, like political campaigns, things can get nasty in Hollywood.

Last week, Warner Bros. apologized to Sony Pictures Classics and canned an award consultant who had set up a fake Twitter account in order to snipe at Bennett Miller’s “Foxcatcher.”

But this isn’t new or news. Exactly. After all, Hollywood will repeat this particular madness. These folks love a sequel. But what about the rest of us?

Transgender stand-in

Last spring, an audience member at an Aspen Shortsfest panel of film and TV writers — among them, Oscar nominee Craig Borten who penned “Dallas Buyers Club — was genuinely crestfallen upon learning that Rayon (Jared Leto) was an invention.

It’s so nice to imagine that nervy, wounded character softening and challenging the bigoted Ron Woodruff. Borten and co-writer Melisa Wallack did, after all. The transgender character was created as a stand-in for others who had been on the frontlines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, but Rayon didn’t exist. I felt the audience member’s pain, but I never felt rooked by a movie that was in many ways a parable about a tarnished hero and his transformation.

Don’t get me wrong: I am not a fan of mendacity. There’s far too much at play these days.

While the vetting of political ads is an exhausting but increasingly crucial civic service, I’m not sure the same can be said of the scrutiny these movies get.

Granted, the bigger the subject — presidents, battlefield exploits — the more filmmakers should take care not to muddy the waters more than they already are.

Yet historians are hardly in agreement about public figures. The “Selma” controversy began with a piece by Mark K. Updegrove, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. And LBJ aide Joseph A. Califano Jr., has been one of the film’s most vociferous critics. This doesn’t discount their complaints but they do have a stake in Johnson’s legacy.

Their concerns also speak to a worry, not unfounded, that too many of us are fine with learning about the past solely from popular culture. What smart person wouldn’t be freaked that people are shifting away from being well-read, diligent skeptics to lapping up lessons from the big screen?

Movies about historical figures give historians a nice opportunity to speak to the presumably larger audience that major motion pictures — especially those with awards possibilities — afford them. Some of the quibbling strikes me as professional jealousy and competition. You tread on my turf, beware!

When it comes to the past, these films can only be starting points, portals. Although the central events in “Selma” took place in 1965, the film had me reaching for “Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963,” volume 1 of Taylor Branch’s exquisite civil rights account.

Illusion of reality

While there are always exceptions, theater tends not to be bedeviled by the same scrutiny, even when it portrays real people’s lives or historical events.

Why might this be?

Theater begins with the advantage of a kind of wonderful, oddly persuasive artifice. Film reels us in with the visual illusion of reality, with pictures. And, yes, filmmakers like to exploit the real when it suits them and discount it when its rhythms are perhaps inconvenient. But that is in some way the artist’s prerogative.

Writing nearly two millennia before movies began confusing us about the real and the depicted, Marcus Aurelius stated, “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” That seems a little radical but also utterly contemporary.

It took the very clever David O. Russell to give a much-needed elbow to the “based on” come-on.

“Some of This Actually Happened” was the director’s cheeky salvo to 2013’s “American Hustle,” about a con man, his lady love and the 1970s Abscam sting.

Sure, it was a dodge, a claim to the creative space. It was also refreshing.

The Denver Post,Meyer: Big changes coming in Colorado’s marijuana market,"Look around you. These are the good old days of marijuana in Colorado.

Things are about to change.

Prices for pot assuredly will fall, more pot will flood the market, and legislative changes are in the offing for how physicians can prescribe pot for severe pain.

Voters could eventually be asked to add a special tax onto medical marijuana, and there is even talk of repealing Amendment 20 to discontinue the medical marijuana model altogether, lumping all pot sales into the retail market.

“It is fluid. Everyone knew this was going to happen,” said University of Denver law professor Sam Kamin, speaking about the evolution of legal pot in Colorado. “This is the first-of-its-kind regulation. We knew we weren’t going to get everything right the first time.”

Clearly, big problems exist. Whether changes will come from market forces or from the legislature is yet to be determined. But one thing is certain: The state’s caregiver model invites fraud.

Now, a caregiver may grow up to six plants for up to five patients, or 30 total. But they can request a waiver to grow even more. Some are growing hundreds of plants.

As of May, the state had registered about 5,000 caregivers. You do the math. Officials believe because of lax oversight, excess pot is flowing into the black market and likely across state lines.

A bill will be introduced in the legislature next session to limit the number of plants that marijuana caregivers can grow for their patients and require caregivers to go through a more stringent approval process with state health officials.

According to a July report by the Department of Revenue, about 53 tons of marijuana is supplied in Colorado outside the retail and medical marijuana stores — likely coming from the caregiver loophole or through fraudulent abuses of the medical marijuana registry.

Of the 116,287 people currently registered, 93 percent claim they need pot for “severe pain.”

Surely some of those cases are justified, but many are likely bogus. There are too many anecdotes of abuses, such as students feigning back pain to get their red cards or duping doctors into approving marijuana.

Thankfully, the state is beginning to crack down on doctors who have given out questionable medical marijuana recommendations.

Between 2011 and 2013, the Colorado Department of Health and Environment hadn’t referred any medical marijuana physicians to the Colorado Medical Board for investigation in the prior two years. Since then, the department has referred 10 doctors to the medical board for suspected abuse.

Dr. Larry Wolk, director of the CDPHE, said the state now has better scrutiny of physicians, flagging those with abnormally high numbers of recommendations or sparse documentation.

“That is really who we look at as the potential for fraud, rather than the patients,” Wolk said. “Whether a patient has that condition or not, it is up to the physician to document.”

Colorado’s broad allowances for who can get red cards has provided other states with a lesson in how to write their medical marijuana laws.

Massachusetts approved medical marijuana in 2012 for “debilitating medical conditions.” Like Colorado’s, the law lists specific afflictions such as cancer and HIV. But Massachusetts defines “debilitating” as something that “substantially limits a patient’s major life activities.”

New York’s Compassionate Care Act that was recently signed into law allows only marijuana in a non-smokable form for patients with “serious ailments” as recognized on a predefined but flexible list of conditions.

Colorado’s red-card rules allow patients to buy 2 ounces of medical pot at a time. Retail marijuana laws allow 1 ounce, and the taxes are much higher.

In Denver, for example, a red-card holder pays only 7.62 percent in sales taxes, compared with the retail buyer, who pays a total tax rate of 21.12 percent. That includes state and local marijuana taxes and standard sales tax.

The state concluded in its July report that high taxes and fewer stores are keeping Colorado medical-marijuana consumers from switching to recreational cannabis, which will eventually impact state revenues.

Overall, through September 2014, the state has generated $52.4 million from taxes, licenses and fees on both recreational and medical marijuana.

Amendment 20, which provided the constitutional framework for medical pot, doesn’t say anything about sales taxes. That is up to the legislature. A moral question, however, exists on whether something considered medicine should be excessively taxed.

“Practically speaking, the only reason you would tax medical marijuana is because you want it to be in the same competitive space as recreational marijuana,” said Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, who is not sure if there is support in the legislature for increasing taxes on medical pot.

Tax harmonization

The health department’s Wolk predicts a “harmonization” between medical and retail — aligning tax rates, rules, quantities and age restrictions. But raising taxes on medical pot, however justified, will spark an ugly fight. The same will occur if the government puts more regulations onto caregivers.

Imagine people with heart-breaking illnesses pleading to lawmakers for tax relief and decrying limitations on their caregivers who have served them for more than a decade.

Politically, it could be difficult.

Boulder attorney Jeff Gard predicts everything will change over the next few years as retail continues to grow in popularity and medical marijuana use diminishes.

The state’s rule that required vertical integration — meaning sellers must grow most of their own — was lifted on Oct. 1. Gard believes that will lead to more growing operations and eventually more pot.

“The amount of recreational marijuana that will come on the market will be two to three times what it is now,” Gard said.

That will undoubtedly lead to price drops, which could affect the competition between medical and retail. Cheaper marijuana also could be a death knell to the black market.

To see the future of marijuana cultivation, one needs only look south to Pueblo. The county south of Colorado Springs is destined to become the leading growing county, allowing warehouses, greenhouses and farms with pot plants in the ground.

Already, the county has approved more than 400,000 square feet in medical marijuana grows and 965,673 square feet in retail grows.

“It is a huge economic boon,” said Joan Armstrong, Pueblo County planning director. “They are hiring local engineers, contractors, regional builders.”

The issues in Pueblo now are about where the operations are getting their water. The federal prohibition against marijuana means water from federal facilities such as Lake Pueblo is against the law.

The commissioners have worked out arrangements to commingle water from other sources, and growers have been trucking in water.

“Lion’s share”

Every day, more people are turning to Pueblo for grow operations, said Pueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace — who speculates that eventually the county will have the “lion’s share of the state’s grow facilities.”

The amount of pot coming onto the market will eventually lead to a market correction, he speculates.

“Some folks are predicting that it will happen next year,” Pace said. “I talked to someone recently who said there are so many greenhouses that won’t be ready for next spring and summer. The correction won’t be next fall or next year.”

Who will survive? Who will fail? What will a market correction mean to the black market, to tax revenues, to federal scrutiny?

Will Republicans now in charge of the state Senate embrace pot revenue or push for tighter controls or higher taxes?

One thing is for sure: Colorado’s marijuana landscape is anything but stable. Remember these days of the first year of marijuana legalization, because much of it will soon change.

The Denver Post,LGBT: Let doctors help you,"I came out in 1991. A couple of years later, I let my parents know that I was gay. I let my employer know before they hired me. I filled my doctor in on my first visit. And I told my dentist about a decade ago.

Polling data suggest that people who know someone who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are more likely to support laws affirming of LGBT families. In health care, building a relationship with a medical provider by coming out improves outcomes.

Patients who report that their provider is LGBT-friendly are more likely to seek regular care, more likely to get tested for HIV, even more likely to get a flu shot. In order to fully support us in health, providers have to know who our support systems are, who will help us remember to take our medications, who will pick us up when our eyes have been dilated and we cannot drive.

Thirty years ago at a conference hosted in Denver by the precursor to the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association and other LGBT health organizations, a handful of activists — most of them gay and living with or impacted by AIDS — chose to speak up. They drafted the Denver Principles, a manifesto of sorts empowering people living with HIV to demand that they be engaged as equals in their care.

Despite three decades and enormous forward momentum on LGBT rights, conversations about sexuality are still not universal if they occur at all in medical settings. In a survey conducted in 2011 by One Colorado of 1,300 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Coloradans, only 50 percent of respondents had ever been asked about their sexual orientation.

It is time for a broader gay manifesto for health care. If coming out to families moves the dial on LGBT rights, coming out to our medical providers would do the same for LGBT care. Doctors aren’t homophobic. They just don’t know we exist. And most acknowledge that they could use help understanding our needs and our health care concerns.

In partnership with the Colorado and Denver Medical Societies, One Colorado surveyed 378 medical providers this summer. Eighty-two percent shared that they are comfortable taking care of gay and lesbian people.

Unfortunately, only 47 percent of medical providers were comfortable asking their patients about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Only half would be comfortable caring for transgender Coloradans. But most providers were open to learning how to better provide culturally responsive care. We must advocate on our own behalf by teaching our providers how to engage us more meaningfully in care.

This past week, three decades after the Denver Principles were drafted, 400 LGBT medical professionals gathered in Denver again for the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association’s annual meeting, “Striving and Thriving.” There, an exhibit from the National Institutes of Health about AIDS activism, highlighting the creation of the Principles, was on display.

But the conference attendees are the choir. We need to be singing to our primary medical providers and mental health counselors. Obamacare will make health care more accessible to hundreds of thousands of LGBT people. We must engage fully in our health care by coming out.

One of the few people I am not yet out to is my eye doctor. But if he assumes I am straight when I check “married” on his intake form, I will correct him.

I am married, but to a guy. He should know that.

The Denver Post,West Nile-tainted blood kills man in Denver hospital in October,"West Nile virus killed a Colorado man who was getting a blood transfusion in a Denver hospital — even though the donated blood had been flagged for the virus.

Initial screenings of the blood that came from a frequent donor were positive for the deadly mosquito-borne virus. Further testing failed to find the virus, and the blood that was collected at Presbyterian/St. Luke’s hospital was given the OK to be used .

Officials from Bonfils Blood Center, which screens the blood, said they have since modified procedures and now discard any blood once West Nile is detected.

“The blood supply in this country is the safest in the world,” said John Pape, epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “This is a very rare event. We continue to be very vigilant to keep the blood supply safe.”

Nevertheless, the case that was first disclosed Thursday in a report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is being looked at closely by the medical community.

“Most of the blood supply in the United States is tested pretty consistently for West Nile virus,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, an infectious disease doctor with the University of Colorado. “The methods that they use are pretty good, but, like anything, they aren’t perfect.”

Nationally, screening has detected about 3,500 cases of West Nile virus in blood since 2003. And out of more than 150 million units of blood donated in the U.S. in the past decade, just 12 cases of West Nile have been confirmed to have been transferred through donated blood.

In this case, a man who had been bitten by a mosquito gave blood at a hospital-based donation center. Four days later, a male patient getting stem cell treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma at Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center began developing West Nile symptoms. He died about a month later, in October 2012, of West Nile encephalitis.

Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center released a statement Thursday saying the hospital took the lead in investigating the death, working with the state, Bonfils, CDC and the family, whose name was not made public.

“Our investigation confirmed that Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center followed all appropriate blood donation protocols and testing procedures. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of this patient.”

The hospital said it will continue to work with Bonfils, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration “to ensure the safety of all donated blood products, and to safeguard the well-being of the patients entrusted to our care.”

“This is a case where it paints a unique and unfortunate perfect storm,” Dr. Tuan N. Le of Bonfils Blood Center said.

The donor didn’t know he had West Nile because he didn’t have severe symptoms.

The virus was at such low levels in the donor’s blood that it was inconsistently detected during the screening process that tests for a number of viruses, including HIV, hepatitis, syphilis and Chagas — a disease that comes from tropical blood-sucking “kissing bugs.”

When the blood was first run through a test along with five other units, the screening detected a trace of West Nile virus. The technicians pulled the units and tested each one individually. No West Nile virus was detected, so the Bonfils officials believed the first test was a false-positive.

What could have happened is that the level of the virus was so small, the second test didn’t find it.

The donor had made seven donations in 120 days before the infected donation was taken and one donation 35 days after that. The CDC report said that “blood products from those donations had been transfused to nine recipients. Four of these recipients had since died.”

But none of those four deaths is thought to be related to West Nile virus, the report said. However, no clinical samples were available.

The five surviving recipients did not have symptoms of West Nile.

What is West Nile virus?

West Nile virus is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) most commonly spread by infected mosquitoes. West Nile virus can cause febrile illness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord).

What are the symptoms of the disease?

Most people (70 percent to 80 percent) who become infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms. About 1 in 5 infected people will develop a fever with other symptoms. Most people with this type of West Nile virus disease recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months.

A few people might develop severe symptoms. Less than 1 percent of people who are infected will develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis. Recovery from severe disease might take several weeks or months. Some of the neurologic effects might be permanent. About 10 percent of people who develop neurologic infection from the West Nile virus will die.

The Denver Post,"West Nile virus outbreaks will flare up, experts say","West Nile virus outbreaks are likely to flare up in the coming years, spurred on by warmer, longer mosquito seasons coupled with cuts in disease control funding that leave authorities unprepared, according to two new studies.

After an all-time high in 2003 with almost 10,000 cases and 264 dead, the virus backed off gradually for the remainder of the decade — until last year. In 2012, there were 5,674 cases and 286 deaths, almost twice the 2003 mortality rate.

This strong resurgence is suggestive of “unpredictable local and regional outbreaks” to come, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even when the number of infections dies down, the virus remains in circulation with an ever-present danger of periodic recurrences.

“Every once in a while, you will have the right conditions to have it build up in the mosquito and bird populations, and spill over to humans,” said Stephen Ostroff, formerly of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who wrote an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association that accompanied the studies.

“Our sense of urgency and the degree of attention paid to West Nile virus has diminished considerably, and so too have the necessary resources to prevent another outbreak,” Ostroff said.

Two studies — a review of the West Nile virus from the CDC and an investigation of a 2012 West Nile epidemic in Dallas from Dallas County Health and Human Services — were published online Tuesday in JAMA, along with an editorial by Ostroff. The Dallas investigation studied 173 cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease, 225 cases of West Nile fever and 19 deaths in the latter half of 2012.

Transmitted mostly by mosquitoes that have bitten infected birds, the virus made its first U.S. appearance in 1999.

The Dallas study cites the combined effect of a mild winter, early arrival of spring and summer heat, and lots of rain that caused mosquitoes to hang around for longer than usual, allowing more infection to spread.

Meanwhile, funding toward prevention and control has fallen. The CDC’s Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity program — which distributes money to states and large cities for use against mosquito-borne diseases — saw its funding drop from nearly $35 million in the early 2000s to less than $10 million by 2012.

Ostroff, the former deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Infectious Diseases, believes it is a result of growing apathy toward the West Nile virus.

“It seemed like the problem had gone away, and it was an easy place to cut,” he said.

Complacency arises from a belief that a disease is on its way out, but that attitude can be dangerous because some diseases follow more of a boom-and-bust pattern. For instance, experts in the late 1980s thought that tuberculosis could be virtually eliminated from the United States by 2010. An unexpected resurgence of TB a few years later, largely fueled by the onset of the HIV epidemic, hit hard — particularly since funding and TB control programs had already been eliminated.

While many states keep an eye out for West Nile infections in humans, the CDC study stresses that early detection in the carriers themselves is key. To wait for people to become exposed to the virus, have it manifest as an infection or illness, visit a doctor and test positive for West Nile virus could cause authorities to lose weeks in the war against an outbreak.

On the other hand, mosquito traps and tests are inexpensive and certainly cheaper than some of the last-resort measures eventually used to bandage up situations such as the Dallas outbreak. The study cited costs of $1.6 million for aerial pesticide spraying, and $8 million in estimated West Nile-related health-care costs.

By cutting funding for mosquito surveillance, “we’re being pennywise and dollar-foolish,” Ostroff said.

If an infection problem is identified early, authorities can try to prevent swarms of mosquitoes from reaching human hosts by draining blocked streams, introducing predatory fish and applying larvicides to prevent spring hatching.

Currently, no human vaccine or specific treatment exists. Wearing bug spray does reduce one’s risk of West Nile virus, but the CDC study said people aren’t likely to put on repellant regularly, even during well-publicized outbreaks. Advice to wear long pants and sleeves is also unlikely to be followed, especially in the sweltering heat of peak mosquito season.",17/07/2013
The Denver Post,M. Carroll: Sex education in Colorado schools is about public health,"It’s hard to imagine that at the same time the guy who created a potty-mouthed teddy bear for an R-rated film hosted the Academy Awards — which featured a song-and-dance routine entirely about breasts — on a television network owned by Disney, no less, there also exist people prudish enough to oppose sex education.

It’s hard, but not impossible. Colorado’s House last week approved House Bill 1081 expanding sex-ed standards, which is now awaiting approval in the Senate. It’s moving forward, but thanks in no part to the state’s 28 House Republicans, all of whom voted against it.

The Denver Post reported conservatives objected to the bill partly because students would be automatically enrolled in the curriculum unless their parents specifically object, and partly because it’s “a subtle attempt to teach children about gay sex.”

If you’re waiting for the punch line, you might as well get comfortable, because the latter concern was actually the final line of the news story.

If signed into law, the bill would provide funding to teach “comprehensive” and “culturally sensitive” sex education — and abstinence — to straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, minority, immigrant and disabled students, as well as to students who have been victims of sexual abuse.

That anyone believes parents should have to go out of their way to opt into a vital program like sex ed but not less beneficial classes such as, say, trigonometry or pottery, or that there are those who sense a potentially life-and-death matter is an appropriate moment to insert their homophobia is baffling and dizzyingly misguided.

Parents should be their kids’ most influential resource and advocate, but a recent survey commissioned by Planned Parenthood, Family Circle magazine and the Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health at New York University found that half of all teens nationwide feel uncomfortable talking to their parents about sex. Nearly one in five parents are equally ill at ease on the topic.

Monica McCafferty, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains — which has sex-education programs across the state that help explain to teens the only surefire way to prevent unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections is through abstinence — says classroom discussions about sex “are meant to supplement the conversations being had at home, not replace them.”

It’s absurd to think students will engage in sex simply because of what they learned in sex-ed, or straight kids will be turned on to gay sex because of a lesson taught in class. However, there’s no question there are countless kids who have avoided pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections as a result of medically accurate information gleaned from the double emphasis of safety from their parents and teachers.

Nobody wants teens to have sex. No one wants them to drink alcohol, do illegal drugs or text and drive, either. But neither does anyone believe that there’s zero chance none of these things will ever happen, which is why educating them about the risks of sex and teaching them how to be safe is critical.

A Colorado Youth Matter’s 2012 report, “The State of Adolescent Sexual Health in Colorado,” found that 41 percent of high school students in the state said they have had sex. Fifteen percent of newly reported cases of HIV in Colorado between 2006 and 2010 were among people ages 13-25. A baby is born to a teen here every 96 minutes.

Arming teens with the best and most up-to-date information about sexuality, the human body, reproduction, birth control options, sexual behavior and relationships enable them to make healthier, more informed decisions.

Sex education isn’t about religion, morals or conservative ideals. It’s about public health. Preventing teen pregnancies and the spread of disease is everyone’s responsibility, regardless of their political affiliations.

The Denver Post,"LGBT’s next Colorado battles: health care, youth","Colorado’s gay advocates, battle-hardened and motivated by recent historic victories, are already leveraging their political clout to take on the next battlegrounds: health care and the workplace.

They have the statistics to show they are at disadvantages when it comes to the doctor’s office and the workplace.

They want more power for young members of the LGBT family.

And they will be facing a fight.

“While marriage provides a bedrock protection for our families, we cannot stop until every gay and transgender person no longer faces bullying in our schools, barriers in our health care systems and harassment in our workplaces,” said Brad Clark, executive director of One Colorado.

Traditional opponents, however, said they are wary of the agenda, and they will be prepared to fight what they see as an overreach into moral and fiscal issues.

“Health care and kids sound great, but not if it’s just a Trojan horse for all kinds of other things that put their lifestyle over God’s will and society’s values,” said Dan Hancock of Colorado Springs, who campaigned in 2006 for the passage of Amendment 43, which blocks gay marriage in Colorado.

Jenny Kraska, executive director of the Colorado Catholic Conference, which opposed gay marriage, said she would have to wait and see what LGBT advocates ask for before she would pass judgment and comment.

“We have a very deep concern for all people. We’re all created in God’s image,” she said. “And we have outreach programs for gay and lesbian people.”

Barriers to health care

LGBT people account for an estimated 2.6 percent of the state’s population, or about 135,000 people, according to the Colorado Coalition for the Medically Underserved.

The report stated that LGBT people in Colorado are almost twice as likely as heterosexuals to earn less than $35,000 a year and more than twice as likely to be unemployed.

In 2011, One Colorado surveyed 1,300 LGBT state residents and found that 15.8 percent overall were uninsured, compared with 14 percent of the total population. But 27 percent of transgender Coloradans were without coverage.

Such disparities in needs and care will have to compete with the realities of implementing the Affordable Care Act next year.

“We believe health care is part of equality,” said Ashley Wheeland, the health policy director for One Colorado.

She said getting people in a system of care, rather than having to wait to get help or show up in an emergency room, benefits society and is less expensive overall.

But for LGBT, the medical system often seems a place to be judged.

“They treated me like I didn’t know how to care for myself as a woman because I’m a lesbian,” said Nita Henry, 50, of Denver, who waged a successful battle with breast cancer three years ago. “The last thing you want to hear when you have cancer is that you’re complicit in it. You know what? My diagnosis would have been the same if I was a straight woman.”

Narcissa Walker, a 38-year-old transgender woman in Denver, struggles with a list of health issues, including post-traumatic stress after she was sexually assaulted, and asthma, she said.

“It’s an access issue. You have this whole layer of legal red tape you have to go through to begin with,” she said. “And any kind of gender mismatch sends the bureaucrats screaming.”

Often, silence is the enemy.

Doctors often don’t ask patients enough questions, including whether they’re LGBT, for fear of offending them or winding up in legal trouble, said Dr. Mark Thrun, director of HIV prevention and STD control for Denver Public Health.

Patients don’t give doctors potentially important information about their sexual orientation for fear of being judged by a stranger, he said.

“It’s sort of a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ with a medical spin to it,” Thrun said.

Rita Lee, a University of Colorado Hospital physician, said doctors need more training. When she was in medical school, she got about five hours of instruction in issues affecting LGBT patients in four years of classes.

The medical profession is poised for an evolution in how it treats LGBT patients, she said.

“A lot of doctors think, ‘I treat everybody the same, so it’s OK,’ ” Lee said. “It’s not OK, because everyone isn’t the same.”

One Colorado is working with the Colorado Medical Society and the Denver Medical Society to survey doctors on their attitudes toward treating LGBT patients. Later this year, the three groups will develop better training for medical professional, which they hope will be duplicated nationwide. The national Gay and Lesbian Medical Association will hear about the plan during its annual conference in Denver in September.

In March, the Colorado Division of Insurance issued a directive reminding insurers it is against Colorado law to discriminate based on sexual orientation, including those who are transgender.

Kaiser Permanente said earlier this month it would work with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to eliminate health care barriers for transgender people and develop “culturally competent” care.

Vulnerable youth

For 19-year-old Cassian Howell, marriage, insurance and a job are all just vague words, trumped by the routine search for food and shelter.

According to the National Youth Association, nine out of 10 LGBT students have experienced bullying and slurs at school, nearly three times the rate of straight teens. These teens are four times more likely than heterosexual teens to attempt suicide.

The National Coalition for the Homeless and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force stated in 2006 report that while LGBT people account for about 3 percent of the population, the demographic accounts for up to 40 percent of the homeless teens.

The study indicated that LGBT teens are almost eight times as likely to trade sex for money, drugs, food or shelter.

Urban Peak, where Howell often stays, was part of the eight-city public health survey.

“I don’t think it’ll get better,” he said. “This world is never going to get better until people just open their eyes and realize we’re all just people, and we’re all in the same place for different reasons.”

Gabe McIntyre, a transgender 18-year-old boy, has been in and out of the Urban Peak shelter four times since early May, trying to stay away from meth and trying to find acceptance — a word painted above the entrance door.

“I was forced to go to church when I was in a foster family, and wear a dress. It was ridiculous,” he said, recalling an experience that happened last year. “They asked a question in Sunday school one day: ‘Who supports gay marriage?’ I was the only one who raised my hand, and I looked — everyone was staring at me.

“After church, the teacher said she was going to pray for me, and I was like, ‘Really?’ It made me feel like crap.”

Rachel Pater, his case worker, said though every town in America has LGBT teens, they remain an invisible population to leaders, social services and even many charities that could and should reach out.

More shelters like Urban Peak and better funding for programs that address the disproportional number of LGBT youth on the streets would be a big step, advocates said.

“You don’t have to be in the next Pride parade,” Pater said. “But if you can hold your tongue and be a parent, you can find them a mentor; there are gradations of acceptance. It doesn’t have to be rejection or acceptance.

“The statistics show us where rejection leads.”

The Denver Post,AIDS event reminds community the fight is not over,"Clad in a neon green tank top, shorts and heels, Sam Hoops clutched his freshly won gift certificates Saturday morning, popping his hips for the cameras and basking in his Diva Dash Stiletto Run victory.

The 0.5K “comical trot” around Cheesman Park was part of the Colorado AIDS Project’s 25th annual AIDS Walk Colorado, an event that included an earlier morning 5K run/walk and a festival with music, food and a beer garden.

Hoops, 34, said it wasn’t only his first Diva Dash — it was his first time running in heels. And, though he won by a pretty large margin, Hoops remained humble, laughing with the nine other runners and showing that he puts his bright yellow pumps on one foot at a time, just like everyone else.

“It was a lot easier than I thought it would be,” Hoops said.

“Besides that,” he added, pointing to a fresh blister on the outside of his right foot, “everything’s fine.”

This year’s theme for the event was “It’s Not Over,” which set out to remind the community that, despite the advances being made in AIDS research and treatments, the fight is far from over.

Thousands of people trickled in and out of the park throughout the day. Tim Schuetz, the chief development officer for the Colorado AIDS Project, said he expected 8,000 participants — near his original prediction of 8,500.

Schuetz added that about 2,000 people registered for the morning 5K run, but only 200 actually ran it. The others stuck to fundraising and making donations instead.

About 400 volunteers helped organize the events.

“I’m feeling really good about today,” Schuetz said. “One of the things about this year is people aren’t just leaving after the race; they’re staying in the park and hanging around, eating food.”

The event kicked off around 9 a.m. with Mayor Michael Hancock speaking at the opening ceremony. The 5K run started half an hour later, and the festival began just after the run ended.

Denver native Mondo Guerra, a former Colorado AIDS Project client and recent winner of Project Runway All Stars, also made an appearance and walked in the 5K.

While Denver resident Billy Hart, 65, didn’t run in the 5K or take on the Diva Dash, he did come out in rainbow gear to show his support for HIV/AIDS organizations. It was the fourth AIDS Walk Colorado he has attended.

“I knew about 30 people who died from AIDS in the ’70s and ’80s in Denver,” Hart said. “Some people think it (AIDS) is just going to go away, but it isn’t.”

Along with the attendance, Schuetz said he thinks donations are right in line with last year.

Last year, the event raised more than $400,000 to benefit the Colorado AIDS Project and 20 other HIV/AIDS organizations.

The Denver Post,Midweek July Fourth causing more people to stay home,"NEW YORK — Who knew the calendar could cause so much vacation heartburn?

For the first time in five years, Independence Day falls on a Wednesday, leaving travelers unsure when to celebrate and worrying those who make a living off tourists.

“The midweek holiday seems to have travelers confused,” said Anthony Del Gaudio, vice president of hotel sales for Loews Hotels, which isn’t seeing the normal July Fourth spike in bookings.

Those who sell vacations say this year’s calendar gives Americans more options: Tack on Saturday through Tuesday or Thursday through Sunday to the holiday, or just take the entire week off.

But consumers’ confidence has been waning. Now, some aren’t happy about having to burn extra vacation time to get a long weekend. From 2008 through 2011, the work holiday fell on either Friday or Monday, so employees got an automatic three-day weekend.

“It’s irritating because everybody wants those three, four-day holiday weekends,” said Tom Donohue, who runs an HIV-awareness program based in Charlottesville, Va.

In recent years, he has traveled to see family in Pennsylvania, including his father, whose birthday is Monday.

This year, Donohue plans to stay local and save those days off “for an actual vacation,” a Caribbean cruise in October.

AAA, one of the nation’s largest travel agencies, projects 42.3 million Americans will journey 50 miles or more from home between July 3 and July 8. That’s roughly the same amount that traveled in 2007, the last time July Fourth fell on a Wednesday.

The typical traveler will spend $749 over six days, down from $807 over five days last year, according to an online survey of 344 people conducted for AAA.",01/07/2012
The Denver Post,‘Boy or Girl?’ Gender a new challenge for schools,"CHICAGO—From the time they are born, we put our boys in blue beanies and our girls in pink ones. It’s a societal norm, an expectation even, that you just are what you are born—a boy or a girl.

From early on, we divide toys and activities by very distinct gender lines, with superheroes and trucks and muck on one side and princesses and dolls and all things frilly on the other.

Many children land, enthusiastically, on the expected side. Others dabble in both “girl” and “boy” things. But what if your kid, even from an early age, mostly showed interest in doing opposite-gender things? More importantly, what if they wanted to BE the opposite gender—or a less-defined mix of both? And what if they wanted to test those limits in public places, like school?

Would you let them?

It’s not, of course, that pat of a process. Parents don’t just decide to let their kids switch genders. But, whether parents are dragged through the process, or if they decide to work it through more openly, more kids are challenging the boundaries of traditional gender, and going public at younger ages.

And they are doing so with the guidance of a growing faction of medical experts who no longer see this as something to be fixed. Last year, the American Psychiatric Association removed “gender identity disorder” from its list of mental health ailments.

Some experts predict that views on gender will evolve in much the same way they have for sexual orientation, since homosexuality was removed as a mental illness nearly four decades ago. Today, the gender spectrum includes those who are transgender, who see themselves as the opposite gender, and those who are gender variant, or gender nonconforming, whose gender is more “fluid.” For kids, it means they identify part of themselves as boy and part as girl.

“Now these kids . are beginning to have a voice . and I think that’s what’s been making things interesting and challenging—and difficult, sometimes—depending on the family, the kid, or the school,” says Dr. Robert Garofalo, director of the Center for Gender, Sexuality and HIV Prevention at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.

While the numbers are relatively small, it means that, increasingly, schools are having to figure out how to accommodate them, some more successfully than others.

The questions often start with the basics: Which bathroom do they use? Where do they change for gym class? What if teachers or students don’t want to use the pronoun, “he” or “she,” or a new name the student prefers?

It can be difficult, and uncomfortable. In Colorado, for instance, the parents of a 6-year-old transgender girl are suing their school district for trying to make her use a separate bathroom.

The center at Lurie opened recently, in part, to meet the demand from parents seeking guidance for children who are questioning their gender identity and to provide support to older transgender youth who sometimes struggle more in adolescence, even facing a greater suicide risk, especially if they have no backing from family and others around them.

The center also serves as a resource for schools with transgender and gender variant students.

Increasingly, those students are making the transition as early as elementary school, if not before.

Ryan, a fourth-grader in suburban Chicago, is one of those kids.

Most people, upon seeing her big blue eyes, long lashes and flowing blond hair, would never know she’s anything but a girl. But underneath, she is still physically a boy.

Doctors call that gender variant, though Ryan prefers to call herself a “tomgirl.”

“I feel that I’m a girl in my heart,” she says, “and a boy in my brain.”

Her parents allowed her to be interviewed and also agreed to speak to The Associated Press on the condition that the family’s last name, the name of the town where they live and the school Ryan attends not be used in the story.

Though the decision to publicly express publicly as a girl happened at the end of kindergarten, Ryan had slowly been becoming “she” at home for a long time, even when she still had a crew cut.

Six months after her second birthday, her parents say Ryan was drawn to all things pink and sparkly. Ryan, the boy, wore pajama pants on his head, pretending it was long hair, or acted out girl roles from movies.

“I’m wishing . for the one I love . to find me!” the preschooler would enthusiastically sing into the toilet, copying Snow White, who sings into the echoing wishing well in the animated Disney movie.

By kindergarten, Ryan would bolt through the door of the family’s suburban Chicago home, leaving a trail of boy clothes up the stairway—then quickly changing into a skirt and matching T-shirt.

Ryan’s parents, initially told that Ryan had gender identity disorder, tried to get their child more interested in traditional boy things. But Ryan preferred chasing butterflies instead of footballs. Her dad scheduled extra “father-son” time, thinking that might have an influence. But nothing changed.

“The next step was to eliminate all girl things—can’t write about girl things, can’t draw girl things, can’t talk about girly things … and that just didn’t feel right,” says Sabrina, Ryan’s mom.

They decided to stop resisting and allowed Ryan to start taking small steps into the outside world, at a nearby park, for instance, where she wore her girl clothes.

For her kindergarten Halloween party, Ryan dressed as a princess and, shortly after, asked her parents to refer to her as “she,” a request to which they agreed, though it took a few months to adjust.

Their first support came from a pediatrician who specialized in gender, as well as other parents with children like Ryan, many whom they met through an online listerv. They are, as they call themselves, “affirming parents.”

“There’s a realization that it’s not a phase or something that’s ending when the preschooler gets to kindergarten,” says Kevin Gogin, the program manager for school health programs at the San Francisco Unified School District, which recently added a transgender category in student health surveys. The survey found that 1.6 percent of high school students and 1 percent of middle school students identified as transgender or gender variant. Elementary students weren’t in the survey, but Gogin says the district has seen more young transgender and gender variant students, too.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have transgender rights laws, according to Michael Silverman, the executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York City. He is representing the family of Coy Mathis, the 6-year-old transgender girl in Colorado.

But even in states that don’t have laws, he says districts are often open to guidance.

“By and large, most educators want to do the right thing and want to know how to treat all of their children equally,” Silverman says. But often, they don’t know how.

In California, which has had protections for transgender people for some time, a new law requires schools to provide transgender and gender variant students with “equal and full access to programs and facilities,” such as gender-neutral bathrooms, if need be, and private changing areas for gym and sports.

There can be resistance, of course—even in families and friends, as Ryan’s parents discovered.

Neighbors in the Chicago suburb where the family lived when Ryan was born stopped asking about or acknowledging her when she started dressing in girl clothes. “It was as if she no longer existed,” Sabrina recalls.

Early on, people in their own extended family also struggled with their decision to let Ryan live outwardly as a girl. Some said: “I think what you’re doing is wrong” or “Ryan’s too young to know.”

Cousins made fun of her, too, and once shut her in a dryer to taunt her.

Sabrina and husband Chris sat their family members down to talk and, over time, they say they came to an understanding.

“Our commitment is that our children are in an accepting, loving environment—and if someone’s not on board with that, then they’re not going to be around,” Chris says, calmly but firmly.

They also moved to a neighboring suburb, where some said a particular elementary school would be more open to Ryan.

They still fear a harsh reaction from people outside their community. But they say most people locally have been accepting.

And she notes how well the staff at Ryan’s school has handled things. She remembers meeting with the principal and teachers at the end of Ryan’s kindergarten year. She told them that Ryan would likely enter first grade as a girl, then came home to find that Ryan was ready to make the transition—right then.

“I don’t want to do this anymore,” Ryan told her parents, referring to what she now calls the “revolving door” of changing her appearance from boy at school to girl at home.

Her mom alerted the school. “You know how we spoke about, that it might happen next year?” she said. “Well, it’s happening tomorrow.”

They were ready, and allowed Sabrina to explain things to Ryan’s classmates—that Ryan liked to dress in girl clothes and liked girl things.

One of Ryan’s friends also stood up: “I want everyone to know this is Ryan’s first day as a girl, and everyone better be nice.”

One boy talked about how he’d once worn his sister’s shirt when his own got wet. A girl said she’d worn her brother’s boots. And then the kindergarteners moved on, Sabrina says.

Of course, how a school staff and a community react still varies widely from place to place. But overall, attitudes about differences in gender identity have been changing, even in the last decade, says Eli Erlick, a transgender student and graduating high school senior in Willits, Calif., a small town in the northern part of the state.

When Erlick began her transition from boy to girl at age 8, she says that even she didn’t know what the word “transgender” meant. She just knew that she wanted to live life as a girl. “I thought I was the only person like this,” she says.

School was difficult. Some teachers made fun of her in front of the class, she says. To avoid dealing with which bathroom to use, she would pretend to be sick, so she could go home and use the facilities there.

Now Erlick is the director of an organization called Trans Student Equality Resources, which provides schools with training and information about students like her. Erlick also has helped her school district and others in California develop transgender policies.

Some schools in other states are doing the same.

“There is definitely more awareness,” says Kristyn Westphal, vice principal at Grant High School in Portland, Ore.

There, they’ve established a student support team to determine how well the school is meeting the needs of transgender and other students. Earlier this year, the school also created individual gender-neutral bathrooms that any student can use.

Bathrooms often become a focal point because, when children are young, the transition is often more “social,” a change in clothing and hairstyle.

As some kids move into puberty, they might use hormone blockers and, eventually, start hormone therapy to help their bodies transform from male to female, or vice versa. But any kind of surgery, experts say, is still relatively rare, even in adolescence.

Ryan’s parents will consider these options later. But for now, Ryan sees no reason to choose one gender over the other—”at least until I get married or something,” she says. So she uses a separate bathroom at school, as the principal has arranged with her parents.

A separate bathroom was not, however, a workable solution for the parents of Coy Mathis, who are suing their school district in Fountain, Colo. Kathryn Mathis, Coy’s mother, says it’s about more than that.

“If it were just a toilet, then just having the gender-neutral option would be fine. But it’s really about being accepted,” Mathis says.

“What’s happening now—they will call you a girl but you’re not really a girl, so you don’t get to act like one. And that’s incredibly damaging.”

The school district has declined to comment on an ongoing case.

Mathis says she’s heard from several parents who’ve made the decision for their transgender children to go “stealth.” In other words, they make the transition—from boy to girl or girl to boy—and then move, so no one knows.

“That’s how they’re doing it … because there aren’t laws to protect them,” Mathis says.

Even in Ryan’s case, the initial transition at school wasn’t always smooth.

While her own younger classmates were accepting, older kids called her “gay” and a “fag.” Early on, a few followed Ryan around on the playground. “Are you a boy or a girl?” they’d ask repeatedly.

Her parents had prepared her for this type of reaction as best they could. Ryan, who her parents say is a strong-willed, independent kid, was mostly just annoyed. Still, she was relieved when her principal quickly stepped in to enforce the school’s anti-bullying policy.

One mother also recalls how, early on, a few other parents worried about their boys being around Ryan—that it might cause them to be confused about their own gender. But that talk eventually dissipated, she says.

Sabrina took it upon herself to speak about Ryan at school curriculum nights, to answer parents’ questions. And now, the principal says, it as a non-issue. “Ryan is Ryan,” she says.

It’s not been as easy at other nearby elementary schools, where there’s been more friction over the few other transgender students. Some administrators have come to Ryan’s principal for advice—and she’s already been in contact with her counterparts at the middle school Ryan will eventually attend.

No one expects that adolescence will be easy.

“The more challenging times are up ahead, and we’re clear about that,” Sabrina says.

But Scott Morrison, a transgender student at Grant High School in Oregon, says having support at home and at school, as he did, will make a big difference for kids like Ryan.

Morrison, a graduating senior, moved to Oregon from Virginia three years ago.

“Gender identity is probably the most important part of me,” Morrison says. “It’s the most important discovery I’ve made about myself.”

He transitioned from female to male a year later and says support from his mom, his friends and his new school—and help from a counselor—likely prevented him from committing suicide.

According to a 2010 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 41 percent of transgender people surveyed said they had attempted suicide. That figure rose to 51 percent for those who said they’d also been bullied, harassed, assaulted or expelled because they were transgender or gender nonconforming at school. The survey was a joint project of the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

With more support and an ability to live more openly, however, some wonder if it will be better for Ryan and this up-and-coming group of transgender and gender variant kids.

“I’ll be really curious to see what this next generation looks like,” says Masen Davis, the executive director of the Transgender Law Center, a civil rights and advocacy organization based in San Francisco. “I’m hopeful.”

Ryan is, too. “It’s just made me feel more strong and confident,” she says of the support she’s gotten from her parents and her school.

People who know her say that’s true. She is a bubbly kid, they note. She loves to draw, sing and write poetry, loves sports and running. On the school playground, she can be found in the middle of a group of girls, doing cartwheels and playing tag.

“Most people forgot that she was ever a boy,” says one of her girlfriends, a fellow fourth-grader.

If her parents ever question their decision to let Ryan go public at school, they say they pull out her first-grade photo and compare it with the one from kindergarten, taken when Ryan was still hiding her girl self.

“There is a light and a twinkle in her eye that’s unmistakable,” Sabrina says of the first-grade photo. “And if nothing else, just looking at that picture, we’re clear we made the right choice.”

The Denver Post,‘Boy or Girl?’ Gender a new challenge for schools,"CHICAGO—From the time they are born, we put our boys in blue beanies and our girls in pink ones. It’s a societal norm, an expectation even, that you just are what you are born—a boy or a girl.

From early on, we divide toys and activities by very distinct gender lines, with superheroes and trucks and muck on one side and princesses and dolls and all things frilly on the other.

The Denver Post,Coalition of health groups releases new nonbinding guidelines on sex education,"WASHINGTON — Elementary-school students should use the proper names for body parts and, by the end of fifth grade, know that sexual orientation is “the romantic attraction of an individual to someone of the same gender or a different gender,” according to new sexual-education guidelines released Monday by a coalition of health and education groups.

The nonbinding recommendations to states and school districts seek to encourage age-appropriate discussions about sex, bullying and healthy relationships, starting with a foundation before second grade.

Experts say schools across America are inconsistent in how they address such sensitive topics.

Cora Collette Breuner, a pediatrics professor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children’s Hospital, praised the approach of encouraging discussions at an early age.

“Trying to cover this stuff when kids have already formulated their own opinions and biases — by the time they’re in middle and high school — it’s too late,” Breuner said.

Valerie Huber, executive director of the National Education Abstinence Association, does not agree with the standards’ topics and goals.

“This should be a program about health, rather than agendas that have nothing to do with optimal sexual-health decision- making,” she said. “Controversial topics are best reserved for conversations between parent and child, not in the classroom.”

Other groups involved with the guidelines include the American Association of Health Education, the American School Health Association and the Future of Sex Education Initiative.

New guidelines

The recommendations on sexual education offered to states and school districts by a health coalition include:

• By the end of second grade, students should be able to use proper names for body parts; explain that all living things reproduce; identify different kinds of family structures; explain that all people have the right to not be touched; and explain why bullying and teasing are wrong.

• By the end of fifth grade, students should be able to describe male and female reproductive systems; understand changes during puberty; define sexual orientation; define HIV and ways to prevent it.

• By the end of eighth grade, students should be able to differentiate among gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation; describe the signs of pregnancy; explain why a person who has been raped or sexually assaulted is not at fault.

The Associated Press",09/01/2012
The Denver Post,AIDS divides the globe,"At the International AIDS Society’s annual meeting in Rome last month, there was a lot of good news. Chief among it was the presentation of solid evidence that antiretroviral therapy does more than treat HIV — it can also prevent the virus.

New findings from the HIV Prevention Trials Network have demonstrated that early treatment for people living with HIV can reduce sexual transmission to their partners 96 percent. The Partners PrEP study has found that giving antiretroviral therapy to the HIV-negative partners of those living with HIV can reduce their chances of acquiring HIV up to 73 percent. And there is further evidence that male circumcision is effective in preventing HIV in men.

But amid all the good news, one stubborn fact was hard to ignore: AIDS remains a metaphor for inequality.

In the world’s wealthier nations, where access to medicine is widespread, AIDS is becoming a chronic disease rather than a death sentence. But in the developing world, 1.8 million people die of AIDS each year. In the Northern Hemisphere, we are seeing a new generation born HIV-free, while each year in the southern half of the world, 370,000 babies start life infected with HIV. In the southern region, 9 million people living with HIV are still waiting for treatment to survive.

It is hard not to conclude from all this that life is not valued equally across the world. This is morally wrong and unacceptable.

A mother should not have to choose between treatment for herself and treatment for her newborn. People should not be dying of AIDS when treatment is available. It is morally wrong that babies are still being born with HIV when we know how to prevent it, and it is morally wrong that children are still growing up as AIDS orphans.

At a recent United Nations High-Level Meeting on AIDS, member states unanimously adopted a Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS that sets bold new targets for 2015. But even as the fight against the virus is starting to turn, some countries have reduced their contributions to the worldwide effort.

Now is not the moment to retreat. We must see beyond the near-term costs toward the long-term benefits of innovation and investment for AIDS.

If we want to turn scientific successes into progress for the poor, we must overcome the forces that threaten access. We have to scale up, even as some donors are scaling back, and we have to use innovation to overcome social division and inequity.

We urgently need to move forward on five fronts.

First is developing a new generation of options that will lower treatment costs, deliver smarter drugs in smarter ways, and provide better approaches to HIV testing, diagnostics and delivery.

Second, we need new ways to make sure life-saving services reach everyone who needs them quickly. We need to increase treatment literacy at the community level, increase demand for services, and improve delivery on the ground. We must also work with countries, the pharmaceutical industry, international organizations and NGOs to ensure that new discoveries are accessible to all who need them.

Third, we must reduce the time it takes for research findings to be integrated into policy. Currently, it still takes about one year to get research results published, then five to 10 years to translate them into public health policy, and three to five more years to gear up to implement them on a national or global scale.

Fourth, we need better primary prevention of HIV. We must focus on hot spots where transmission is most likely to occur, especially to reach women and girls; men who have sex with men; migrants; prisoners; people who buy and sell sex; those who inject drugs; and others whose access is blocked by stigma, discrimination and criminalization.

Finally, we must leverage the networks created to combat HIV, using the reach, resources and lessons of the AIDS movement to improve global health beyond HIV and bring a wide range of life-saving discoveries to the poor.

The AIDS virus does not move slowly, and neither should we if we are to hope to achieve our collective vision of “zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.”

The Denver Post,"AIDS activists, experts push for human rights","VIENNA — Activists and experts at the International AIDS Conference here said the human rights of people infected with HIV must be a priority if the spread of the virus that causes AIDS is to be stopped.

Human rights are the main theme of the 18th biennial event, which ends today. Another focus is the rapid spread of HIV in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Participants in the conference said that rights are an essential part of any attempt to slow and reverse an epidemic that has so far claimed 25 million lives.

“We have to implement HIV prevention as a human right,” said Anna Shakarishvili, Ukraine coordinator for the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, also known as UNAIDS.

Rights are important, advocates said, because discrimination against people with HIV, intolerance toward gay men and women, and criminalization of intravenous drug use drive underground those in need of treatment or at risk of becoming infected.

Key to the success of HIV-prevention programs is involving the affected communities.

Meena Saraswathi Seshu, of the Indian organization SANGRAM, said encouraging sex workers to practice safe sex means respecting them and their opinions. In her work, she learned that female sex workers were more knowledgeable about men and their attitudes than she was.

“You give us the condoms and we’ll do the rest,” the sex workers told her.

Coercive measures don’t work, activists said. Ordinary people are going to have to give up their prejudices if the HIV plague is to be defeated.

“All people have rights, regardless of whom they have sex with,” said Roman Dudnik of the AIDS Foundation East-West.

Several studies published this week in The Lancet, a British medical journal, recommended that governments adopt non-coercive treatment programs for drug users and provide them with antiretroviral treatment if they are infected with HIV.

In a separate commentary, Lancet editors expressed support for the Vienna Declaration, a statement published last month calling for the decriminalization of illicit drug use.",22/07/2010
The Denver Post,People: Jolie and Pitt donate $2 million in Namibia,"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are donating $2 million to the Namibian sanctuary where they spent Christmas with their kids.

The donation to the Naankuse Lodge and Wildlife Sanctuary was made through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation in the name of their daughter Shiloh, who was born in Namibia.

In a statement released late Sunday, Angelina said, “We want her to be very involved and grow up with the understanding of her country of birth.” Angelina said Rudie and Marlice van Vuuren, the owners of the sanctuary, are old friends. “We continue to be impressed by their hard work and dedication to the people and conservation of the land and wildlife of Namibia,” she said.

The Jolie-Pitt family spent Christmas together at the exclusive lodge, where staff say the children helped to feed and care for orphaned baby baboons and foxes and saw a leopard released back into the wild.

The van Vuurens said in the statement that they were “overjoyed” that Angelina and Brad chose Naankuse as the foundation’s partner in Namibia.

Dara Barrett, head of finance at the Naankuse sanctuary, told The Associated Press that the money would be used primarily to benefit the community of San bushmen on the farm and surrounding areas.

“Some of the donated funds will be used in the running of a clinic which provides free medical care to the community of bushmen, including the treatment of malnutrition, tuberculosis and HIV,” she said.

The remainder of the funds will be used for large animal conservation projects and other San community projects which have yet to be identified, Barrett said.

After eight years, it’s over for Mila Kunis and Macaulay Culkin, according to the New York Post.

Kunis, 27, who co-stars in “Black Swan,” and child star Culkin, 30, split amicably and remain friends, according to her rep.

In a 2009 interview, Kunis said of Culkin, the star of the “Home Alone” movies: “We grew up together. You find a steady rock in your life and that’s all you need. We have our ups and downs, but work through them.”

Anne Francis, who starred in “Honey West,” the mid-1960s TV series about a sexy female private detective with a pet ocelot, died Sunday. She was 80.

Francis, who was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007 and underwent surgery and chemotherapy, died of complications of pancreatic cancer at a retirement home in Santa Barbara, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Friends and family members were with her, said a family spokeswoman, Melissa Fitch.

The blond actress with a beauty mark next to her lower lip, Francis was a former child model and radio actress when she first got a role on the big screen in the early 1950s.

She acted or starred in more than 30 movies, including “Bad Day at Black Rock,” “Battle Cry,” “Blackboard Jungle,” “The Hired Gun,” “Don’t Go Near the Water,” “Brainstorm,” “Funny Girl” and “Hook, Line and Sinker.”‘

She also achieved cult status as one of the stars of “Forbidden Planet,” the 1956 MGM movie co-starring Walter Pidgeon and Leslie Nielsen and featuring a robot named Robby.

Francis, however, never became a major movie star and was more frequently seen on television as a guest star on scores of series from the late ’50s and decades beyond, including an episode of “The Twilight Zone” in which she played a department store mannequin who comes to life at night.

After partying hard on New Year’s Eve, David Arquette checked himself into rehab in California on Saturday, a friend told the New York Post.

The friend insisted that Arquette, 39, is trying to deal with alcohol abuse and that there’s no drug addiction. “He was drinking too much,” the friend said. “Once he drank too much, he became somebody he didn’t like.” The actor has been struggling with emotional problems — mainly over his October separation from his wife, “Cougar Town” star Courteney Cox, 46, the friend said.

The Denver Post,Food-safety test with almost instant results nears rollout by Colorado company,"A company is set to roll out a new device that can test for bacteria on surfaces and bring results within a half-hour.

If successful, the device, known as the BrightSPOT Food Safety Test, could revolutionize the food-safety industry, experts say.

“The big thing is to prevent contamination from ever getting to the consumer,” said Bill Locatis, chairman and chief executive of Beacon Food Safety. “It’s a market that is crying out for a solution right now.”

As it stands now, it can take at least a day and even three or more to get results.

But Beacon Food Safety, which has a lab at the Colorado Science + Technology Park at Fitzsimons, has developed the portable test that can detect 112 pathogens, including E. coli, listeria and salmonella.

The company plans to begin selling the product by February.

Beacon will market the device to food safety and sanitation providers, processing plants, hospitals and even restaurants down the road. There may be home applications eventually.

The potential breakthrough comes as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration have issued numerous alerts recently about contaminated food.

Earlier this month, an E. coli outbreak was linked to gouda cheese sold at several Costco stores in the country, including Colorado. The state health department on Wednesday recalled gorgonzola cheese sold in Costco stores because of E. coli contamination.

Each year, about 76 million illnesses occur from the country’s food supply. About 5,000 people in the U.S. die each year from foodborne illnesses, according to the CDC.

Current testing methods used in factories and processing plants can take days to yield results, because they typically involve swabbing a surface and then waiting for a culture to grow.

Beacon’s test provides nearly instant results, allowing food-processing companies to quickly distribute their products instead of waiting days for the results of conventional testing.

Beacon’s test mechanism is a disposable, clear green, circuit-like chip that looks like a USB flash drive.

A food-prep surface is swabbed and that sample is placed on the chip, which is then inserted into a machine the size of a shoe box. The sample reacts with a chemical and the light it gives out is “spotted” by photodiodes, identifying the bacteria and the level of it through its DNA and RNA.

Results are displayed on a computer screen.

What makes the technology remarkable, Beacon officials say, is that it can detect bacteria at levels as low as a single cell. Currently, it takes about 10,000 bacteria cells to identify the type of bacteria. A sample must be cultured over several days so the bacteria can replicate itself to provide enough of the sample to identify.

Gary Smith, a retired meat science professor at Colorado State University, recalled an E. coli outbreak at a fast-food restaurant in the 1990s that caused more than 140 people to be hospitalized and killed three. They became sick from just a handful of E. coli cells in hamburger patties, Smith said.

“I think it is a wonderful breakthrough if, in fact, they can do it,” said Smith, part owner of a Texas-based food-testing company. “If it can detect a low number of bacteria cells, then they have something.”

Beacon Food Safety is an outgrowth of Beacon Biotechnology, a company that developed the chip to identify diseases such as cancer and HIV.

But Locatis, a longtime food-safety expert, and his partner, Beacon Food Safety chief executive Steve Stroud, recognized its potential use in food safety. They approached Beacon Biotechnology chief executive Fred Mitchell about joining forces.

Because of the cost and the long time it takes to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration, the disease-identifying device was put on the back burner.

The chip has been in development for about 3 years and about $3 million has been spent on it.

Beacon has a handful of food safety and sanitation businesses lined up to use the device. Because the chip is disposable, it will be inexpensive to purchase, maybe around $5. The cost of the device it plugs into is still being worked out.

Chandler Keys, spokesman for the JBS meat processing plant in Greeley, said food is tested already numerous times before shipping. Another test to ensure the safety of the public can only help.

“Every day we are looking for new technologies, new ways to know that once that carcass goes into that cooler, we’ve done everything humanly possible (to make it safe),” Keys said.

Congress is expected to pass new laws soon to require more stringent testing of food, making Beacon’s device an attractive option for food-processing companies.

Kip Moore of Golden knows firsthand how devastating it is to contract a foodborne illness. In 2005, while on a family vacation, Moore and his then-1 1/2-year-old son, Chance, became sick from E. coli after they ate at a restaurant in Kansas, Moore said.

Moore recovered in a few weeks. Chance was hospitalized for a month and nearly died after his kidneys shut down. Doctors told Moore that his son would need a kidney transplant.

But without any medical explanation, Chance started to regain kidney function. Today, the boy is leading a normal life — although he and his siblings no longer consume meat when they go out to eat.

“The one thing I learned was how naive and ignorant we are that this happens in our world,” Moore said. “When that happened, I didn’t even know what E. coli meant. I just assumed our food was safe.”

The Denver Post,President Obama should lead on global health,"Colorado has long been a “center of excellence” for the treatment and cure of tuberculosis. The Denver TB Clinic and the Colorado Department of Health infectious disease department are respected throughout the nation.

Now that multi-drug resistant TB has been spreading around the world, Colorado’s own National Jewish medical center has taken the lead in treating new forms of TB. Coloradoans can be proud of the state’s long tradition of excellence in TB treatment.

Globally, TB, AIDS, and malaria constitute a deadly trio of “diseases of poverty” that continue to devastate impoverished people around the world.

Ten years ago, the world created the Millennium Development Goals with the hope of cutting extreme poverty in half and halting the spread of AIDS, TB, and malaria by 2015. Although we are making progress toward reaching all 8 goals, 2 billion people still live in extreme poverty and nearly 5 million people continue to die each year from AIDS, TB, and malaria.

During his campaign, candidate Obama spoke powerfully about supporting the Millennium Development Goals and making it U.S. policy to play a leadership role in ensuring that the goals are met. But the Obama administration has cut the budget of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, the largest and most effective global health organization in the world.

The cuts have placed the Global Fund in the unenviable position of having to tell successful programs they can no longer be funded when their success has brought the world within sight of halting the incidence and reversing the spread of AIDS, TB, and malaria for the first time since the diseases reached pandemic levels.

This is no time to be slowing down the program’s progress. The Global Fund estimates that mother-to-child HIV transmission can be virtually eliminated if the current rate of progress can be maintained. But only a sustained effort by the United States and its world partners will make this happen.

President Obama has a chance to continue the historic U.S. role as the major world leader in global health solutions. Next week, leaders form over 180 countries will gather in New York for the Millennium Development Goals summit to assess progress and next steps to achieve the goals. President Obama will make a major foreign policy address at the summit.

Recently, our own Colorado Representative Dianna DeGette joined with 100 other members of Congress in signing a letter urging President Obama to set the Global Fund budget at $2 billion per year for the next three years. Since the U.S. contribution is matched two-for-one by the other rich countries, this would ensure $6 billion per year for the Fund and would allow it to continue saving millions of lives and to expand its programs to save millions more.

President Obama should seize the opportunity next week at the Millennium Development Goals summit to show the kind of leadership in AIDS, TB, and malaria treatment and prevention that Americans expect from their President. And Congress has the opportunity to help him find a fiscally responsible way to fund the effort within the foreign aid budget so no new funding is required.

The Denver Post,Medical-marijuana advocates seek society’s approval,"The liquid inside the test tube is neon green, the color of lime Kool-Aid or the mad-scientist potions found only in comic books. Perhaps it’s fitting, then, that the contents come with a whiff of danger. They are a mixture of marijuana and solvents, stirred together in a furious swirl by a lab technician wearing protective goggles and latex gloves.

Running the concoction through a $70,000 machine, the technician can learn with scientific precision the plant’s unique chemical makeup, its potency, even its growing method.

The ultimate goal? Find out how good it is.

“We’re not going to be taken seriously unless we have proof,” said Michael Lee, the owner of the lab and its adjacent medical-marijuana dispensary, Cannabis Therapeutics.

This is the new science of pot, part of a fresh wave of study and innovation among scientists and cannabis advocates all seeking to solve a central dilemma: In Colorado and other states, first came the approval of marijuana as medicine. Next comes the challenge of proving its effectiveness.

The newest research leaves little doubt that marijuana — or at least its chemical components — has promise in alleviating symptoms of some ailments, while also making clear that the drug is not without its drawbacks, some potentially serious.

What is less certain is whether Colorado’s medical-marijuana system of dispensaries and caregivers — where commitment to scientific rigor and compassionate patient care is largely voluntary — can maximize that treatment potential for the benefit of patients.

Some dispensaries keep detailed patient records and embrace scientific testing in the hopes of providing patients with what works best. But medical-marijuana users report other dispensaries seem interested in just slinging snazzy weed, regardless of a patient’s needs or ailments. (One ad on Craigslist: “Licensed caregiver looking to trade for Widespread Panic tickets.”)

The mainstream medical community, meanwhile, questions whether any system that uses a raw plant as medicine can be optimally effective. Instead, conventional drug researchers see promise mostly in harvesting marijuana’s ingredients for more traditional medicines and avoiding consumption methods like smoking that can hurt patients’ health.

“If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine,” a panel of experts wrote in a landmark 1999 report for the National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine, “it lies in its isolated components.”

Most marijuana advocates enthusiastically embrace a future in which pot is as much an accepted medicine as penicillin. But that future might not come without significant changes to the way medical marijuana is handled. New medicines require new tests and government approvals. Those lead to new regulations and new oversight. There is a focus on standardization, sterility, precision, discipline.

If there were ever a world where marijuana was available behind the counter at the corner pharmacy, the do-it-yourself independence of Colorado’s — and many other states’ — medical-marijuana system might not have a place. The bud could become obsolete, and dispensaries — both medically inclined and not — could go extinct with it.

Indeed, not every marijuana supporter is watching the development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals enthusiastically.

“When they get through the FDA with their cannabis-based drugs, no legislature in the country will allow doctors and patients access to whole, smoked marijuana,” said Allen St. Pierre, the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.

Medical mystery

Medical marijuana hasn’t always been a strictly on-your-own endeavor.

Historians have found references to the use of cannabis by healers in China and India dating back to at least 2000 B.C. The Irish physician William O’Shaughnessy wrote about the medical uses of cannabis in the mid-1800s. Cannabis-based treatments were commonly prescribed in the early 1900s in America before marijuana prohibition, which came about in the 1930s because of concerns over the drug’s psychoactive effects and fears they could lead to criminal behavior.

What was missing, though, was an understanding of how marijuana provided its touted medical benefits — or, for that matter, even a basic understanding of how marijuana gets people stoned.

“We knew marijuana has effects,” said Bob Melamede, a biology professor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and a prominent marijuana activist. “So the question was, ‘How does it have them?’ “

Answers arrived starting in the late 1980s with the discovery in the body of something called the endocannabinoid system. The system acts much like a traffic-control network, with receptors spread out across the brain, the organs, the immune system and various other areas to regulate functions as diverse as appetite, mood and pain. Using chemicals produced in the body called cannabinoids as traffic cops, the body turns on or off those receptors and controls the different functions.

Sending certain cannabinoids to one receptor and flipping it on, for instance, stimulates appetite. Tripping another dampens the body’s inflammatory response.

Marijuana also contains cannabinoids that can fit into the endocannabinoid system’s receptors — purely “pot luck,” Melamede cracks. Ingesting marijuana unleashes into the bloodstream swarms of new cannabinoid molecules that quickly begin linking into the system and flipping switches. This explains both the medical and recreational effects of the drug — which in many cases are one and the same.

By jiggering with the receptors that control appetite, for instance, marijuana creates the much-joked-about munchies. But it is that same effect that spurs the appetites and calms the stomachs of cancer and AIDS patients. In the same way marijuana impairs the motor skills of some users, it can also calm the painful muscle spasticity of multiple sclerosis patients.

Highs and lows

There is no scientific consensus that marijuana cures any disease or ailment. But research generally suggests smoking marijuana has pain-killing, muscle-calming, nausea-controlling and appetite-boosting effects in many patients. That means studies have shown marijuana can provide benefits to patients suffering from each of the eight different medical conditions specified in the state’s medical-marijuana constitutional amendment.

Scientists, though, disagree to what extent marijuana is beneficial and whether marijuana is more effective in those areas than existing treatments. Medical-marijuana supporters, meanwhile, cite other studies hinting at benefits in treating anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and many other conditions.

The effects also vary from user to user, and using marijuana is not without its risks. Studies have shown smoking marijuana may be more harmful to the lungs than smoking cigarettes. Other studies suggest marijuana could lead to increased anxiety or more severe mental-health problems in some people and dependence in others. Marijuana is the most commonly cited drug for people seeking treatment for illicit drug abuse, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Mostly, though, mainstream medical-marijuana studies and research reviews conclude that more thorough clinical trials of the drug are needed. Those follow-up studies are made difficult by federal drug-control laws, which place tight restrictions on marijuana research.

The proliferation of state medical-marijuana programs has been of little use to researchers, said Cecilia Hillard, a neuroscience professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin and a past president of the International Cannabinoid Research Society. Participants in those programs are self-selected, she said. That means those patients are pre-disposed to thinking marijuana will help, further muddying the scientific analysis of raw marijuana’s benefits and drawbacks.

“It’s hard to say how much people are really using it medicinally versus recreationally,” Hillard said. “Right now we’re sort of to a point where the claims of medical benefit are so numerous and so over-the-top that you tend to get into the realm of, ‘Well, I just don’t believe any of this.’ People are saying it’s good for everything.”

A handful of recent clinical trials — the first clinical trials of smoked marijuana in this country in 20 years — have provided some clarity. After being tasked by the California state legislature, the University of California at San Diego’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research sponsored about a half-dozen placebo-controlled trials to assess whether marijuana is effective as a painkiller for HIV and multiple sclerosis patients and for people suffering from nerve damage.

Across the board, the trials found some promise in marijuana as a treatment option.

“I was a little bit surprised, to tell the truth,” said Igor Grant, the center’s director. “I somewhat expected that what we would get is a mixed result . . . which would not be so unusual. But the fact that all of them came up with a consistent result makes me feel a little more comfortable in saying we could have something here.”

That does not mean, however, that Grant is ready to proclaim marijuana as a miracle treatment. For starters, patients in the trials generally continued on the drugs they were already taking for their conditions and used marijuana to supplement. Second, Grant said, smoking marijuana is just too impractical a delivery method for medicine. Among the questions: How do you control the dosage?

“Would you prescribe smoking cannabis cigarettes in a hospital room where oxygen tanks may be present?” Grant asked. “The great likelihood is that we need alternative systems.”

And that is exactly where marijuana’s pharmaceutical gold rush is taking place.

Separating help from high

Sitting at lunch one day recently in a restaurant near his UCCS office, Melamede, the biology professor, reaches into his jeans pocket and pulls out two small vials containing inky green liquid. They are marijuana extracts, he explains, formulas carefully measured for potency and chemical makeup that can be taken under the tongue in a predictable dosage. He also has ideas for marijuana skin patches, tongue strips and lozenges, all part of a new publicly traded pharmaceutical venture he has embarked on called Cannabis Science.

“The key thing is,” he said, “we’re addressing the government’s concern that smoked marijuana is not medicine.”

Cannabis Science recently hired a company to help it negotiate the Food and Drug Administration approval process, and Melamede said he is hopeful it won’t be long before the company can begin clinical trials targeting veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain patients.

But Melamede knows he is already behind in the race. GW Pharmaceuticals, a British firm, is currently preparing for its final clinical trials in the United States on a drug called Sativex, a marijuana-derived mouth spray the company intends as a treatment for cancer pain. The drug has already won approval in Canada and Great Britain and is in the last stages of approval in Spain.

What makes Sativex unique among current pharmaceuticals is that it is a blend of natural cannabinoids made directly from marijuana plants — grown in southern England — rather than synthetic re-creations of marijuana components, like drugs such as Marinol.

GW believes such an approach will yield better medicine, and it is already experimenting with other cannabinoid combinations for new drugs.

“There are more than 60 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, so we believe that leaves plenty of scope for future development,” GW spokesman Mark Rogerson wrote in an e-mail.

Most exciting to those looking to establish marijuana’s potential benefits as medicine in a more socially accepted form is a cannabinoid called cannabidiol, or CBD. A batch of new studies suggest it may have medical effects like THC — the chemical in marijuana that gets a user stoned. But it eliminates the psychoactivity produced by THC. In other words, it’s medical pot that won’t get you high.

Colorado dispensaries have begun to stock marijuana strains high in CBD. But to tout a strain as being CBD-rich, it helps inspire consumer confidence to prove that it is, which is where laboratory testing comes in. Using pricey machines called high-performance liquid chromatography systems, medical-marijuana labs can detail the percentages of THC, CBD and a handful of other cannabinoids in the plant. The lab work is unchecked by the government and is performed only by labs either connected to or hired by dispensaries.

A number of dispensaries across the state now routinely place little cards detailing the test results next to each strain in their display cases. Patients can use the cards to pick marijuana suited to their need based on the numbers and not the strain names, which aren’t always descriptive of a strain’s effects.

“We hope to take the mystery out of the names and put in more science,” said Frank Quattrone, the owner of Pure Medical Dispensary in Denver. “. . . The names, hopefully, will become irrelevant.”

Dispensaries have also used the laboratory analysis as a guide in developing more potent product. Cannabis Therapeutics in Colorado Springs has developed a hash oil — essentially concentrated marijuana — that it touts as 86 percent THC. (Even the most knock-out marijuana buds are usually no more than 20 percent THC.)

Andreas Rivera, Cannabis Therapeutics’ manager, says the oil will only be sold to terminally ill patients as a form of palliative care.

“It’s really about pain management instead of getting people super stoned,” he said.

But the availability — and marketability — of such products raises a question: Are patients actually using the analyses to find the best medicine or the best high?

Inside Cannabis Therapeutics, it is clear most patients currently see only limited value in the new data. Some ask about the numbers, but their eyes quickly glaze over during the explanation. Others skip the numbers entirely, instead choosing by past experience or the much cruder ratio of how much “upper” versus “downer” the strain contains.

Most patients rely to some extent on the advice of the woman working behind the counter, Julie Anderson.

“I usually ask Julie what the best she’s got is,” said patient Frederick Ross, who suffers from such severe appetite loss because of various medical conditions that he eats only once a day. “I don’t play the numbers.”

But some patients have taken an interest in the new data. One woman with kinky, waist-length, brown hair crouched in front of the counter to study the numbers for several minutes before making her selection. She said she has been writing down the THC and CBD ratios of the strains she’s tried and has used the data to guide her decisions.

“I’m trying to apply some analysis to it and some logic based on the information I have,” explained the woman, who asked that her name not be used because she didn’t want her co-workers to know she is a medical-marijuana patient. “Hopefully I can make a more-educated decision.”

Whatever the efforts by dispensaries to put more science behind their products, though, they’re likely to be met with a sniff from the pharmaceutical industry, which believes most people will never accept taking medicine by smoking a raw plant.

“The current system of distribution may actually prevent cannabis from ever being accepted as a mainstream medicine by most patients and physicians,” GW’s Rogerson said.

People in the medical-marijuana business naturally bristle at such talk. But among some there is a sense that wider acceptability of marijuana by the medical world might actually restrict marijuana access.

State medical-marijuana programs, NORML’s St. Pierre explained, function as relative oases for cannabis access — bypassing a whole set of federal rules because the federal government simply refuses to participate. Right now, marijuana is legally a Schedule I controlled substance because the federal government sees no accepted medical use for it and considers it to have a high potential for abuse. That classification means doctors can’t prescribe it and pharmacists can’t distribute it.

If marijuana were to be placed in a less-restrictive classification — as a petition currently pending with the Drug Enforcement Administration requests — doctors potentially would be able to prescribe it. That ability, though, would bring with it Food and Drug Administration oversight, production controls, inventory caps, distribution limits, security rules and more. Plus, with a federally blessed system to get patients cannabis in the same way they get cholesterol drugs, why would most state governments continue with their jury-rigged medical-marijuana systems?

“We see this as a boxed canyon,” St. Pierre said.

Limitless learning

Back at Cannabis Therapeutics’ lab, John Kopta — a Colorado State University biochemistry grad who runs the facility — is more optimistic. Only a few other labs in the country, mostly connected to the medical-marijuana industry, are doing what his does. The more study they do, the more proof they have. The more proof they have, the more they can lead the way forward.

“There’s dozens of different cannabinoids in the plant, and we know of 10 of them and what they do,” he said. “It’s really limitless.”

The Denver Post,King Soopers recalls ground beef for salmonella risk,"Denver-based King Soopers has recalled nearly a half-million pounds of ground beef that could be infected with salmonella, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Wednesday.

Fourteen illnesses in Colorado have been linked to beef sold between May 23 and June 23.

The strain of salmonella is resistant to many commonly prescribed drugs, the USDA said in the announcement, which could put people at risk for prolonged effects of the illness.

The beef is labeled with the USDA establishment number “EST. 6250” on the front of the package and sold at retail stores in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to the USDA.

Inspectors are urging King Soopers’ customers to check their freezers for beef that might be included in the recall.

The USDA said it had no reason to believe any of the ground beef was still available in stores.

King Soopers has established a recall hotline: 1-800-632-6900.

Salmonellosis is one of the most common food-related illnesses, but infections can be life-threatening for those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, chemotherapy patients or people with HIV, according to the USDA.

The most common effects are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. Those with the illness also can experience chills, headache, nausea and vomiting. Symptoms can last up to seven days, the USDA said.

Joey Bunch, The Denver Post",22/07/2009
The Denver Post,Soopers beef recall first for salmonella,"The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said today that this week’s recall of King Soopers ground beef is the first time the U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a beef recall because of salmonella.

The recall includes 466,236 pounds of ground-beef products sold between May 23 and June 23 and is labeled “EST. 6250” on the front of the package.

The meat was sold retail in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to the USDA.

Fourteen Coloradans have been sickened, with three cases in Boulder County, four cases in Jefferson County, two each in Mesa and Routt counties, and one each in Denver, Douglas, and Larimer counties. Six people have been hospitalized.

Though salmonella is a common bacteria in raw meat, this particular strain is drug-resistent, which may have prompted the federal action, said Alicia Cronquist, an epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment.

She said that the rule of thumb is that for each confirmed case of salmonella, 38 others go unreported because they are untreated stomach ailments or physicians fail to test for it, Cronquist said.

“Potentially, more than 500 people in this state have become ill, and that’s a significant outbreak,” she said.

Federal inspectors are urging King Soopers’ customers to check their freezers for beef that might be included in the recall.

King Soopers has established a recall hotline, 1-800-632-6900.

The Denver Post,New doctor raises pulse for multiple sclerosis,"DENVER—High hopes are hanging on Dr. Timothy Vollmer.

Multiple sclerosis patients—who account for one of every 580 Coloradans—are lining up to see a man who believes there will be a cure for their disease and is leading the way in treating their debilitating symptoms.

Since his arrival in town last month, Vollmer has reinvigorated the local MS community. He was the catalyst for an alliance of Denver agencies studying and treating MS that now depend on him to lead research and clinical studies and teach.

“We needed this vision. Vollmer’s on fire,” said Karen Wenzel, executive director of the Rocky Mountain MS Center. “To pull this talent is very hopeful to us.”

MS is the leading cause of disability in young women and the second leading cause in young men. Worldwide, an estimated 2.7 million people have been diagnosed with it.

Yet a cure or even effective treatment remain elusive.

Until 1993 there were no treatments or therapies for MS patients. Now there are six.

“It was a distressing first 20 to 30 years in this disease; we didn’t know how to treat it,” Vollmer said. “The technology had to develop, and we had to learn more about the disease, which led to more studies.”

The University of Colorado Hospital, the University of Colorado Denver and the Rocky Mountain MS Center recently created an alliance to conduct research and provide a range of medical care and community services to MS patients. The new entity is called the Rocky Mountain MS Center at Anschutz Medical Campus and made it possible, after a year of negotiations, to draw Vollmer to town.

Vollmer, 53, comes to Denver from Phoenix, where he was at the Barrow Neurological Institute for six years. Prior to Barrow he was on the faculty at Yale School of Medicine.

Beyond study into the elusive cause of MS, research is focused on three key fronts, he said:

—Diagnosing and treating the disease early enough to keep damage from occurring.

—Shutting down the disease and retraining the central nervous system and how it interacts with the brain.

—And most challenging, stopping MS in those who have already experienced brain damage, and repairing that damage.

One hope lies in a vaccine-like approach, Vollmer said. Scientists are also working to identify what they believe may be a virus that causes the immune system to attack.

“Using those strategies, we can have the success HIV has had and oncology has had,” Vollmer said.

Vollmer has also been developing a molecule for four years that he will continue in Colorado that could be used as part of a treatment.

Other work under way by Vollmer and his colleagues includes trials using drugs approved for other uses.

And Jeffrey Bennett, a clinician and scientist at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, is studying people with optic neuritis, a condition where the optic nerve becomes inflamed, affecting a person’s vision. He is researching those afflicted by it and why so many go on to develop MS. Now the researchers hope that with Vollmer’s name attached to the Rocky Mountain MS Center at Anschutz, more money for more research will flow in.

“If you ask anyone in the world about MS research and clinical trials, they will talk about Vollmer,” said Donald Gilden, chairman of the Department of Neurology at UC Denver.

That was certainly the case with Chris Plant. As soon as he heard Vollmer was considering coming to Colorado, he asked to become his patient, even if it meant flying to Arizona.

Plant, of Littleton, was diagnosed 13 years ago, when he was 29 years old, after experiencing a series of symptoms, including numbness in his hands.

“What really attracted me to him is his dedication to research and to actually making people well,” said Plant, who takes a daily injection. “He is someone that wants to truly make the lives of MS patients better.”

Living with MS is manageable and most others can’t see the pain or the fatigue, but Plant, a member of the RMMSC board, can feel it. One of his legs isn’t as strong as it used to be and in the winter it sometimes drags.

Vollmer’s experience with MS began long before he was a medical student at Stanford University. When he was a teenager the disease struck his aunt, who was in her 20s. She died about a decade later without any treatment.

“The goal is to provide care to the family and not just the person who is affected,” he said. “I hope to provide a higher level of care.”

The RMMSC and the university hope that in pulling together they will all be able to increase the services for patients under Vollmer’s purview.

“We view this as a win-win-win,” said Dr. John Corboy, co-director of the center at Anschutz. “We’ll be able to offer many more services.”

The 30-year-old RMMSC, which recently opened a new clinic on Potomac Street for the uninsured and those on Medicare, is in the process of closing a deal for a new location for its adult day program and owns one of four brain-tissue banks in the nation.

Now it will also push hard to raise millions of dollars for research and for the work of Vollmer and Corboy.

Disease often hits early

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a fatty substance in the central nervous system that helps nerve fibers conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain. Symptoms include changes to vision, muscle weakness, balancing problems, fatigue and numbness.

• 80 percent of patients develop MS between the ages of 16 and 45.

• Women are diagnosed with MS twice as often as men.

• Over 400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with MS.

• The incidence of MS is higher north of the 38th parallel. The 40th parallel runs through Boulder.

• 70 percent of people living with MS have a level of impairment that interferes with at least one essential daily task.

• After 15 years of disease, 50 percent will require at least a cane to walk.

The Denver Post,Press Club toast for Bob Costas should be “here’s to your health”,"Hey, Bob Costas, how you feeling?

The legendary NBC sportscaster is down to receive the Denver Press Club’s Damon Runyon Award on June 22. It’s the 13th annual dinner for the lucky winner.

Well, maybe not so lucky. Winners of the Damon Runyon Award have a habit of dropping dead. The latest example is David Halberstam. He won the Runyon in 2002 and died Monday in a car accident.

That brings the total to five dead honorees. Passed away are Mike Royko, Herb Caen, Molly Ivins, Ed Bradley and Halberstam. The last three died in the past six months. The first honoree, Jimmy Breslin in 1995, had a stroke – but that was before the award, and he’s hanging in there.

“Eventually everybody (dies),” says Press Club president Bruce Goldberg. “The award is for long-term accomplishments, and we were honored to have them here. But it’s not like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx.”

Maybe it’s worse.

Goldie Hawn, who lives some of the year near Aspen, came down the hill Monday night to speak at the Unique Lives & Experiences series. (Doris Kearns Goodwin comes to the Buell for the series Tuesday.)

Hawn came on stage wearing brown suede Uggs and a black Prada cocktail dress. Mix ‘n’ match. She carried a pair of Lucite sandals – just to show the crowd that she actually had some nice shoes, but the Uggs were too comfy. She talked for about an hour, did a 30-minute Q&A and then was mobbed backstage by patrons eager to press the flesh with fame.

The last two questions thrown at her: In which movie did she portray a character most like herself? “Seems Like Old Times,” made in 1980. And who, besides longtime partner Kurt Russell, was her favorite leading man? Chevy Chase.

“We had a lot of fun,” she said.

It was a tough Tuesday for Hawn, however. The bad weather spooked her, so she didn’t fly private or commercial to Toronto, reskedding a speech there.

The Denver Post,Hated foes no longer,"There is a body of thought in professional sports that says rivalries – the stuff of heat and passion and acrimony – are on the wane.

Sure, there are rivalries, but are they too manufactured? Has it become too much a case of “our mercenaries vs. your mercenaries?” Has big money and free agency made today’s rivalries more trumped up than real?

“I just don’t see the kinds of bloodthirsty rivalries that you had in the past,” Hall of Fame NHL coach Scotty Bowman says. “Players are friends with the other team now. You didn’t have that in the past. If you were caught talking to another player, teammates and coaches would frown. Teams change so often now that rivalries are harder to establish.”

Many great rivalries still exist in college sports, such as Duke vs. North Carolina in basketball and Auburn vs. Alabama in football. But pro sports seem to have suffered a drop in good old-fashioned grudge matches.

Individual rivalries are perhaps even harder to find. Where are the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier days, when it was impossible to be neutral as a fan? You were either an Ali guy or a Frazier guy. Where is the Larry Bird-Magic Johnson type of rivalry? Or the Joe DiMaggio-Ted Williams-style feuds?

Try to come up with a top 10 list of the best individual rivalries of all time, and it seems like all of them are from the distant past – although Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal – French Open finalists today – has the making of a great rivalry over the next few years.

Is there a lack of rivalries because of the increased financial comfort and notoriety of today’s pro athlete, and the vast increase in sports media that has made athletes more wary of controversy?

Whatever the reasons, here’s hoping the great one-on-one rivalries of the future can approximate these 10 from the past.

10 Gordie Howe

vs. “Rocket” Richard

Forgotten among today’s young hockey fans is just how bitter this personal rivalry was.

Both played right wing, on Original Six NHL teams. Both wore No. 9. Each player took turns winning goal-scoring championships, and Stanley Cups. Each played stylish, skillful games, but turned mean at the slightest provocation. Gordie Howe was a farm boy from Saskatchewan while Maurice Richard was French-Canadian. It was Red Wings vs. Canadiens, English vs. French, one great winger against another.

They met seven times in the playoffs, four times in the Finals. Howe’s teams won four meetings, including three of four in the Finals.

9 Bjorn Borg

vs. John McEnroe

They met 14 times, not including exhibitions. Borg won seven matches, McEnroe won seven.

They were a great contrast of style and temperament: Borg, the smooth, unflappable Swede, against the loudmouth New Yorker McEnroe. Their greatest match was the 1980 Wimbledon finals, which Borg won but is best remembered for the 18-16 tiebreaker McEnroe won to force a fifth set.

Tennis just didn’t get any better when these two went at it in their primes. Borg won 62 career matches to McEnroe’s 77, partly because he walked away from the game at an early age.

8 Carlton Fisk

vs. Thurman Munson

Some baseball historians believe the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry didn’t get truly nasty until these two came along, vying for the title of best catcher in the American League in the 1970s.

These two hated each other, period. Munson, a stumpy, mustachioed catcher from Ohio, resented the taller, more athletic and articulate Fisk. Fisk got more ink, but Munson’s teams won more.

Both were leaders of their teams and as tough as they came. They had a major brawl in 1972 when Munson barreled into Fisk at home plate, and the feud continued until Munson’s tragic death in a plane crash in 1979. Fisk was broken up by Munson’s death, and later called him one of the greatest players he ever played against.

7 Joe Louis

vs. Max Schmeling

When the German Schmeling became the first to beat the American Louis, in a 12-round match in 1936, he became a hero to the Nazi Party.

Problem was, Schmeling wanted nothing to do with Adolf Hitler and his politics. That didn’t stop Schmeling’s rematch with Louis, at Yankee Stadium in 1938, from being billed as a collision between world powers that soon would be at war. There may never be as much pure hype as there was before the rematch, but it didn’t last long. Louis knocked out Schmeling in 124 seconds.

The two men ended up good friends, with Schmeling helping to pay for Louis’ funeral.

6 Ted Williams

vs. Joe DiMaggio

It seems hardly imaginable, but the year Williams became the last player to hit .400 (.406 in 1941), he didn’t even win the American League MVP award.

Joltin’ Joe of the Yankees did. That was the year DiMaggio hit in 56 consecutive games, and their personal rivalry kept on from there. The men weren’t bitter enemies, but relations were often strained. Things didn’t get much better after they retired, with Williams proclaiming himself the greatest hitter who ever lived, while DiMaggio insisted on being introduced as the “World’s Greatest Living Ballplayer.”

Williams finished with better hitting statistics but never won a World Series, which DiMaggio did so regularly.

5 Jack Nicklaus

vs. Arnold Palmer

From 1960-66, these golfers combined to win six of seven Masters titles. When Nicklaus beat Palmer for the 1962 U.S. Open on his home course, the Oakmont Country Club just outside of Pittsburgh, a fierce rivalry kicked into gear. Nicklaus became the dominant force in golf, winning a record 18 majors, including six Masters green jackets, but Palmer was the charismatic crowd pleaser, with Arnie’s Army following his every step.

Their rivalry helped bring golf into the mainstream of American sports in the 1960s. The two were uneasy together in the early days, but became good friends in their later years.

4 Chris Evert

vs. Martina Navratilova

They met a staggering 80 times from 1973-88, not including numerous exhibitions.

In the end, their rivalry in women’s tennis was about as even as it could get. Navratilova won 43 of the 80 matches, but each finished with 18 Grand Slam singles titles.

Evert was the patient one from the baseline, while Navratilova was the hard-charging, more emotional player. They were barely cordial during the rivalry, but, as often is the case, they became good friends when their playing days ended. They often socialize in Aspen.

3 Larry Bird

vs. Magic Johnson

After playing against each other for the 1979 NCAA title, this pair would take the NBA to dizzying new heights in popularity in the 1980s – fueled in part by their bitter personal rivalry.

Johnson was from the “Showtime” Lakers, while Bird played for blue-collar Boston. Johnson won the college title game and a championship his first year with the Lakers, while Bird won rookie of the year and a title in his second year.

Bird won the first team matchup, in the 1984 Finals, but Johnson’s Lakers won in 1985 and 1987. Bird, a supreme trash talker, would yell, “Hey, I got a little one” when Johnson ended up guarding Bird on a switch. It wasn’t until they filmed a commercial together in 1984 that the two became more friendly, and when Johnson was diagnosed with HIV, one of the first people who called him was Bird.

2 Wilt Chamberlain

vs. Bill Russell

Their teams would meet 142 times in their long NBA careers, with Russell’s Boston Celtics winning 85. While Russell clearly could claim superiority in overall team success, winning 11 championships overall to Chamberlain’s two, Wilt’s backers could point to his astounding statistics in arguing their man was better.

Chamberlain averaged 28.7 points and 28.7 rebounds per game against Russell, who averaged 14.5 points and 23.7 rebounds. Chamberlain scored 62 points on Russell in a Jan. 14, 1962, game. But Russell’s team won, 145-136.

All in all, it was The Rivalry of all of basketball, not to be remotely approached until Bird and Magic came along.

—————————————-

1 Joe Frazier vs. Muhammad Ali

There was unparalleled hype surrounding these two legendary boxers when they fought. They met three times, including 1975’s “Thrilla in Manila” that was watched by 700 million people worldwide. Frazier was the working man’s hero, the quiet, plodding puncher from Philadelphia who was always coming hard. Ali was the brash, controversial showman who converted to Islam and talked about how pretty he was.

There was genuine animosity between the two, especially from Frazier’s camp, but they respected each other and helped take boxing to new heights. Ali won two of the three bouts and will always be known as “The Greatest” to millions of boxing fans.",08/06/2007
The Denver Post,Bill puts science in school sex ed,"Jinny Apodaca’s 2-year-old daughter sat on her lap Thursday as she asked legislators to pass a law that would require school districts to teach kids science-based sex education.

Apodaca was a 14-year-old middle schooler when she got pregnant, and she wishes she had been taught about condoms and birth-control pills and how to say no.

After two hours of passionate testimony, the House Education Committee advanced legislation mandating public schools teach kids the latest about AIDS, hepatitis C and the link between the human papilloma virus and cervical cancer.

House Bill 1292 says schools should emphasize abstinence, including from oral sex, and it says districts should involve parents in curriculum planning.

But it updates state law to make sure all public schools are teaching more than just abstinence.

Every hour one Colorado girl younger than 18 gets pregnant, a statistic that pushed Rep. Nancy Todd, D-Aurora, to introduce the emotionally charged legislation. About 12,130 teens get pregnant every year in Colorado, her bill says.

Todd, a former teacher, choked up before she moved the bill to the House floor.

“If this was a perfect world, we wouldn’t have to discuss this,” she said. “Families would take care of it.”

Rep. Tom Massey, a Republican from Poncha Springs, abandoned the other four Republicans on the committee to support the bill. He said he wished all children received adequate information on sex education from their parents but said that isn’t the case.

“Regretfully, we have to deal with something called hormones,” said Massey, who has teenage boys. “It’s regretful that we put this on our school districts sometimes to be the purveyors of information like this.”

Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Yuma, said he fears the legislation will make Colorado school districts ineligible for federal grant funding strictly tied to abstinence-only programs. Colorado organizations, including one school district, get just under $500,000 a year from the federal government for those programs.

“It seems like we are taking abstinence out and putting contraception in,” he said, referring to Gov. Bill Ritter’s plan to lift eligibility restrictions on state-funded pregnancy prevention and family-planning programs.

Organizations that promote abstinence – including the Colorado Catholic Conference and the Colorado Family Institute – testified against the bill, saying it would strip local school districts of options and could eliminate federal funding for their programs.

But Rep. Michael Merrifield, a Colorado Springs Democrat who leads the Education Committee, equated the federal money to being “blackmailed” into providing kids with “misinformation and incomplete information” about sex.

Deirdre Maloney, executive director of the Colorado AIDS Project, said it’s foolish to assume all teens are abstaining from sex, and “to hide information from them because it makes us uncomfortable is irresponsible.”

Every hour in this country two teens are infected with HIV, she said.

The bill passed 9-4 and is headed to the full House.

The Denver Post,Jones' charitable side offers eBay bidders a piece of Haggard history,"Mike Jones is having a tough week, but he’s doing a good thing.

There was a fire in another apartment of his Capitol Hill building. Smoke damage forced him to move into a Colfax hotel. Bummer.

Jones is the gay masseur/body builder who brought down evangelical preacher Ted Haggard with revelations of a three-year sexual relationship. Now Haggard says he’s 100 percent hetero after some counseling. And Jones says he’s out of the back-rub business and auctioning off his purple massage table on eBay. Coloradoconfidential.com broke the story over the weekend and Jones confirmed it Monday. “I’m done with the business,” he told me.

He wants to donate the auction money to Project Angel Heart, an agency that feeds people living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses.

When I told PAH, they were thrilled. “That’s great!” said development director Mindy Davidson. This is nice timing, as PAH will serve its 2 millionth meal on Saturday.

It should be up on eBay soon, he says. “And if someone wants, I’ll autograph it. This is where it all happened.”

Call the cops

The Police are coming to Denver June 9. Fresh off the U.K. rock trio’s reunion performance of “Roxanne” at Sunday night’s Grammy Awards ceremony (the high point of that stinker), the group announced Monday a giant world tour from The Whisky nightclub in Los Angeles that will include the June 9 pullover at the Can.

Exact ticket prices and on-sale dates were not announced for Denver, but should range between $50-$225 before fees – to see Sting, drummer Stuart Copeland and Andy Summers playing together. The group broke up in 1984 and has only played together sparingly since then.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of “Roxanne,” the single that turned the heat on The Police.

The Denver Post,AIDS battle logs a ray of hope,"United Nations – New surveys suggest that the global AIDS epidemic has begun to slow, with a decline in new HIV infections in about 10 countries, the head of the U.N. AIDS program said here Tuesday in the most comprehensive international report ever issued on the disease.

Elsewhere, the number of new AIDS infections continues to rise or continues at its current pace. Meanwhile, public health efforts are reaching only a small proportion of people at risk, said Dr. Peter Piot, the U.N. AIDS executive director.

“It’s a very complex epidemic,” Piot said, and “we can no longer talk about the AIDS” as a single epidemic but as many diverse ones.

India, for example, has approached South Africa as the country with the largest number of HIV infections. India has 5.7 million infected people and South Africa 5.5 million, but the difference may not be statistically meaningful.

South Africa has a prevalence rate of about 19 percent of 47 million people. In India, the rate is less than 1 percent of its population of 1.1 billion.

The most promising news, Piot said, is that the number of new HIV infections has been dropping in three African countries – Kenya, Zimbabwe and urban areas of Burkina Faso.

Earlier, Uganda reported decreases.

Piot said that Cambodia and four states in India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Ndau) showed a drop in new infections, joining Thailand’s earlier success.

In the Caribbean, the world’s second most affected region, behind Africa, new infections have declined in urban areas of Haiti and in the Bahamas. AIDS is the region’s leading cause of death in people ages 15 to 44 years.",30/05/2006
The Denver Post,A simple decision for Buffett,"“In business you look for the easy things to do … and fortunately you find them sometimes,” Warren Buffett said Monday. “Philanthropy is a tougher game.”

Buffett, the legendary investor who started 50 years ago with $105,000 and turned it into $44 billion, explained that in business you seek the path of least resistance and don’t go looking for problems. The whole purpose of philanthropy, though, is to wade into the gnarliest, most intractable problems you can find and then try to solve them.

Following that logic, the world’s second-richest man has just made life a lot tougher for Numero Uno.

Buffett’s remarks came at a ceremony at the New York Public Library in which he formally pledged the bulk of his fortune – a total gift of $31 billion, give or take – to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There’s one big string attached: The money will come in yearly installments of roughly $1.5 billion, and the Gates Foundation has to spend every penny that same year.

Spending an extra $1.5 billion a year sounds like a problem any institution would love to have, but think about it. The Gates Foundation, already the biggest philanthropy in the country by far, has to double its annual spending. That means finding productive ways to disburse an extra $4 million a day, including Saturdays and Sundays – and Bill and Melinda won’t be allowed to just take the money out into the backyard and burn it. Buffett will be watching, and he joked to Gates that “I won’t grade you more often than daily” on how the money is being used.

I should note that both Warren Buffett and Melinda Gates sit on the board of directors of The Washington Post Company. It’s hard to write objectively about people who help run the company you work for, especially when they do things that are praiseworthy; you risk sounding like a suck-up. But there are two fascinating stories here, neither of which I could ignore.

One is the story of Buffett, who spent his life amassing unimaginable wealth, but “all the way along,” he said Monday, “felt that it should go back to society.” He famously announced years ago that he would not bequeath his fortune to his three children for their personal use; now he has followed through. He will give roughly $1 billion each to the three charitable foundations the children have established – a fraction of what he’s giving to the Gates Foundation.

Buffett said he considered himself just a man who was lucky enough to be born in the right place at the right time, with the “right kind of wiring” to be successful in the American system.

The other fascinating story is that of the Gates Foundation, which is set on changing the world.

Bill Gates announced earlier this month that he will surrender some of his duties at Microsoft in order to spend more time on the foundation. Listening to him and Melinda speak at Monday’s ceremony, you got a sense of how mind-blowingly ambitious the foundation’s agenda really is.

They talked about the critical health issues facing billions of people around the world who live in dire poverty, especially HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which Melinda Gates called “the big three.” They talked about rural development in sub-Saharan Africa.

They talked about microlending, which they’ve been studying with an eye toward a new initiative.

Then they switched gears and talked about the foundation’s campaign to reshape secondary education in the United States. The foundation has been focused on trying to reform failing high schools, with mixed results. Gates now operates 19 small high schools in New York City where graduation rates have dramatically improved, although test scores have lagged. An attempt to rescue failing Manual High School in Denver, on the other hand, didn’t work – the Gates prescription of splitting it into several smaller schools turned out, in that case, to be precisely the wrong approach.

The real question, it seems to me, is whether any one organization, even one with essentially unlimited resources and world-conquering managers at the helm, can get its arms around so many big issues. Then again, Buffett has a pretty good track record of evaluating a given organization’s prospects. I hope he’s right this time.

Buffett recalled Monday that he amassed his original stake of $105,000 from people who thought he would do a better job than they could of investing the money. Now he has decided that Bill and Melinda Gates can do a better job than he could of dispensing that money. “It was a simple decision,” he said.

The Denver Post,Bush takes on the brothels,"I’m guessing that President Bush’s foreign policy will stand up about as well to the assessments of future historians as a baby gazelle to a pack of cheetahs.

Yet there is one area where Bush is making a historic contribution: He is devoting much more money and attention to human trafficking than his predecessors did. Just as one of Jimmy Carter’s great legacies was putting human rights squarely on the international agenda, Bush is doing the same for slave labor.

We don’t tend to think of trafficking as a top concern, so Bush hasn’t gotten much credit. But it’s difficult to think of a human rights issue that could be more important than sex trafficking and the other kinds of neo-slavery that engulf millions of people around the world, leaving many of them dead of AIDS by their early 20s.

My own epiphany came in 1989, when my wife and I lived in China and covered the crushing of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement.

Arrests of dissidents were front-page news, but no one paid any attention as many tens of thousands of Chinese women and girls were kidnapped and sold each year by traffickers to become the unwilling wives of peasants.

Since then, I’ve seen the peddling of humans in many countries: the 8-year-old Filipino girl whose mother used to pull her out of school to rent to pedophiles; the terrified 14-year-old Vietnamese girl imprisoned in a brothel pending the sale of her virginity; the Pakistani teenager whose brothel’s owner dealt with her resistance by drugging her into a stupor. The U.N. has estimated that 12.3 million people worldwide are caught in forced labor of one kind or another.

In an age of HIV, sex trafficking is particularly lethal. And for every political dissident who is locked up in a prison cell, hundreds of teenage girls are locked up in brothels and, in effect, sentenced to death by AIDS.

In 2000, Congress passed landmark anti-trafficking legislation, backed by an unlikely coalition of evangelical Republicans and feminist Democrats. Even today, the congressional leaders against trafficking include a conservative Republican, Sen. Sam Brownback, and a liberal Democrat, Rep. Carolyn Maloney.

But the heaviest lifting has been done by the State Department’s tiny office on trafficking – for my money, one of the most effective units in the U.S. government. The office, led by a former Republican congressman, John Miller, is viewed with suspicion by some career diplomats who fear that simple-minded conservative nuts are mucking up relations with countries over a peripheral issue.

Yet Miller and his office wield their spotlight shrewdly. With firm backing from the White House (Bush made Miller an ambassador partly to help him in his bureaucratic battles), the office puts out an annual report that shames and bullies foreign governments into taking action against forced labor of all kinds.

Under pressure from the report, Cambodia prosecuted some traffickers (albeit while protecting brothels owned by government officials) and largely closed down the Svay Pak red-light district, where 10-year-olds used to be openly sold. Ecuador stepped up arrests of pimps and started a national public awareness campaign.

Israel trained police to go after traffickers and worked with victims’ home countries, like Belarus and Ukraine. And so on, country by country.

Some liberals object to the administration’s requirement that aid groups declare their opposition to prostitution before they can get anti-trafficking funds. But in the past, without that requirement, U.S. funds occasionally went to groups promoting prostitution. And in any case, the requirement doesn’t seem to have caused many problems on the ground (partly because aid groups sometimes dissemble to get money). In Zambia, India and Cambodia, I’ve seen U.S.-financed programs work closely with prostitutes and brothel owners when that is needed to get the job done.

Moreover, Miller and his staff aren’t squeamish prudes. Miller is sympathetic to the Swedish model: stop punishing prostitutes, but crack down on pimps and customers. He says that approach seems to have reduced more forced prostitution than just about any other strategy.

The backdrop is a ridiculously divisive debate among anti-trafficking activists about whether prostitution should be legalized. Whatever one thinks of that question, it’s peripheral to the central challenge: Vast numbers of underage girls are forced into brothels against their will, and many die of AIDS. On that crucial issue, Bush is leaving a legacy that he and America can be proud of.",09/05/2006
The Denver Post,"Orphaned by AIDS, embraced by strangers","Idweli, Tanzania – From the back of a lantern-lit schoolroom at a rural orphanage, Fodi Julius fixed his shining eyes on the blackboard. He was fighting exhaustion and trying to please his parents.

They died three years ago, leaving Fodi, 11, and his brother, Nhambo, 8, among Africa’s 12.3 million children who’ve lost parents to AIDS.

Their mom and dad’s final advice: Do well in school, because survival depends on it.

Before moving to the orphanage, Fodi and Nhambo rose each morning from their mats by a fire pit in their crumbling mud-brick hut. They straightened their smudged school uniforms. Their small fingers wove grass in place of lost buttons to fasten tattered shirts.

The boys set out barefoot and without breakfast down the dirt path to school. At lunch break, while others ate, they waited. Finally, when the teacher dismissed them for the day, Fodi and Nhambo wandered through farm fields, foraging for food.

“We’d get leaves,” Fodi said. He weighs 48 pounds, half the weight of others his age.

He mixed those green leaves with water and urged Nhambo to eat, no matter how bad the leaves tasted or how sad he felt.

“I’d just tell him: ‘She died. There’s nothing we can do about it.’ I’d tell him: ‘Even if you cry, she’s not coming back. So we should stop crying and do what we have to do.”‘

But now, after three years on their own, Fodi and Nhambo have beds, meals and basic instruction at an experimental children’s center where they live with 56 other orphans on the outskirts of this dusty, Swahili-speaking village.

Americans half a world away in Colorado and Oregon set up the center – stepping in where governments and big charities had done nothing.

As the world grows more intertwined, African villagers mired in disease, poverty and conflict – and those who want to help them – are discovering new ways to connect, bypassing Africa’s corruption-crippled governments and Western bureaucrats.

Television, radio and reports from migrant sons and daughters have whetted village appetites for better living conditions. The recent arrival of cellphones and e-mail in rural hubs encourages direct links with Americans.

Help began with an e-mail

Here at Idweli, whose 1,300 people include more than 200 orphans, the children’s center where Fodi now finds full plates of rice and potatoes began with a simple e-mail.

Godfrey Mahenge, a student from Idweli studying medicine in Tanzania’s capital, Dar es Salaam, five years ago vowed to do something to help orphans back home. He’d told elders of his plans. They’d dismissed him as a dreamer.

Mahenge drowned five years ago while swimming in the ocean. But his girlfriend, Neema Mgana, kept sending e-mail queries to groups outside Africa. One e-mail reached Barry Childs, 61, a corporate executive turned philanthropist in Oregon who’d formed the group Africa Bridge to try to help villagers.

Instead of dismissing the message as just another African e-mail scam, Childs asked for details. He paid for Mgana to visit him.

Childs enlisted Vic Dukay, 49, a former aviation-business owner in Denver with experience running AIDS projects, to work with him at Idweli. Their first visits in 2002 focused on listening to children and village elders.

“You want to be useful,” said Dukay, a heavyset, jovial man prone to overworking himself. Orphaned at age 15, he was later moved to tears as he sat with kids unsure where they’d find their next meal and who habitually raised their hands before speaking.

“It took me back instantly to when I was 15,” he said. “That look in the eye, body language, speech, that low, soft voice, wanting to be in the back of the room away from everybody, not wanting to be seen. You look in their eyes. Have you ever seen anybody really sad? I can see sadness in somebody’s eyes. … Probably from looking at myself.”

Dukay and Childs guided construction of the center, five ochre-hued buildings with cement-and-stone foundations. Village men did the work. There’s no electricity or running water.

This year, the Rockefeller Foundation awarded Dukay a grant to assess whether the children’s center is meeting village needs. He led an evaluation team, including psychologists and social workers, on his 10th visit to Idweli this fall – feeling “more alive than I’ve ever felt,” he said.

Staving off extremists

Sustaining this children’s center, and possibly replicating it elsewhere, is more than a humanitarian effort, Dukay said. Security analysts worry that Africa’s millions of desperate AIDS orphans will join jobless urban masses adrift and vulnerable to extremists who could lure them into violence.

“Where best to recruit?” Dukay said. “Out here in the hinterlands where there is no security.”

He watched Fodi in donated white sneakers playing soccer, fighting hard for the ball against bigger players, despite his physical weakness after three years of eating very little. Nhambo, solitary and silent, played a bit, too.

Any chore, Fodi volunteered. He hauled a 16-foot-long bamboo pole for a mile to help cooks who were building a shelf.

Life’s better now than before, Fodi said, recalling how taunts from children with parents tormented him.

“I’d leave, go sit someplace alone. Very bad to hear. I thought: ‘This will happen many times in my life. People will always be telling me I am an orphan.”‘

Far more typical across Africa today are orphaned children who raise other children with no help. Village elders are overwhelmed. Nearby at the village of Ndulamo, three teenage girls – Shida Mahenge, 16, and her sisters, Ona, 14, and Rehema, 12 – huddled together at sunset. When they beg for food from neighbors, “people cannot give,” Shida said.

For five years after AIDS killed their father and then their mother, Shida served as surrogate parent and caretaker, insisting that Ona and Rehema stay in school.

“I’m always telling them they need to behave and to listen to their teacher and when they don’t understand, to ask questions,” she said.

She deals with food. Working to earn money means enduring harassment from boys and men unaccustomed to working with a girl. First, Shida broke rock into gravel that villagers sell to road crews for maintenance.

“Very hard work. You have to carry the rocks. It takes a long time with the hammer to break the rocks into small stones. Now, I work carrying timber. I think it might be better.”

But this night they had no food or wood to burn and stay warm. The girls huddled silently in the cold, blue darkness. They were hungry, barely able to think about their dreams of attending a vocational school.

“We like to pray,” Shida said. “We have a very hard life now. We pray to God to help us, so that we will not get sick. … We need help to survive.”

HIV adds to struggles

Helping children such as this can be difficult because many are infected with HIV, the virus causing AIDS. Doctors are scarce, about one per 50,000 people in rural Tanzania, let alone anti- retroviral drugs for villagers.

At a German-run clinic nearby in Bolongwa, Dr. Rainer Brandl was amazed to see a tiny, bloated girl, her feet swollen, staggering in from a farm.

When he tested Veneranda Ganga, 13, he found she was HIV-positive with virtually no immunities. Doubting she’d survive, Brandl put her on anti-retrovirals.

Veneranda gained strength. She began helping around the hospital, cradling an abandoned 1-year-old girl. She told nurses she’d been sick for years, after her father died of AIDS. Later, her mother died, too, when Veneranda was 5. Before dying, she said, her mother told her: “You must listen to other people. One day I will die, and you must get along.”

Each day Veneranda retrieved water, washed dishes and took care of her brother and an aunt’s two young children. This year, she grew too weak to work. “I told my uncle, I better go to the hospital.”

Frustrated and deluged with sick children, Brandl works on a shoestring, unable to pay and keep staff. United Nations and U.S. aid often funds workshops for doctors and social workers in cities, drawing them away from urgent work in villages, he said.

“Nobody wants to work out here,” he said.

Orphans start to cope

At the Idweli children’s center, regular meals, chores and classes let orphans begin coming to terms with their plight.

Vaileti Bonifasi, 14, who was 2 when her parents died, said she’d been sneaking away to visit their graves, praying a bit, talking and crying.

“I was walking back home from school thinking: ‘How can I not even know what my mother looked like?”‘ Vaileti said. “I thought about it all the way home. And I was lying on my bed. When I got up, the ghost of my mother came to me. She was speaking to me. But I couldn’t understand her.”

Godfrey Mahenge’s younger brother Elia, 21, told Vaileti she should ask her brother Fred at the family house by the graves if he had a photo of their mother.When they arrived, they found Fred standing with his wife, Gloria, and their baby.

“There’s no picture” of their mother, Fred said. Instead, Fred produced a wrinkled, laminated driver’s license showing their father, who died in 1994. Vaileti clutched it but still wanted a photo of her mother.

“I need to compare it with the face of the ghost,” she said.

Involving the villagers

The cost of the project at Idweli, including construction and support for daily operations, has been about $300,000. Now Dukay’s evaluation is focused on perceptions of villagers and the children.

“Are there any concerns?” Dukay asked recently in the meeting hall, addressing village elders. “If there are any problems in what we are doing, I would like to know directly.”

Some villagers benefit – such as Florence Doset, 39, a mother of two who teaches at the center. She earns $50 a month.

“Because of these children, we have money,” she said. “So we’re happy.”

Others are bewildered. Orphans at the center suddenly enjoy better living conditions and food than other children living with their parents. Project supporters have begun to give small “microcredit” loans to villagers.

Fodi is now studying as his parents advised, but the habit of worrying about Nhambo is ingrained. He recently warned Elia that Nhambo’s mind wanders in school.

But Fodi also was beginning to think about himself. In the classroom where he sat recently in the early evening, he summoned the last energy he had to hold his head up. Three lanterns cast a golden light just bright enough to illuminate the blackboard. Elia was teaching English, writing sentences – “You sing a song” – for students to copy.

This was extra instruction to give the orphans a better chance at school. Twenty boys, mostly older, were taking advantage.

And Fodi was especially determined.

He wanted to be ready for competitive tests that determine who qualifies for college.

“I want to be a teacher,” Fodi said. “Then I can help other people.”",11/11/2005
The Denver Post,Vickers lowers number for lift,"Boulder – How does a young man from the tough Fifth Ward in Houston wind up surrounded by rocks and mountains?

“Football,” Buffaloes V-back Lawrence Vickers said.

Simple and clear from a 22-year-old who likes things that way.

Succinct from the sixth of nine children, the first this close to gaining a college degree. Terse from an emotional leader who speaks to teammates in what he calls his most natural manner – real, rugged, rough.

“I wanted to do something different, vibe in a different scene,” Vickers said. “I wanted a total turnaround.”

This senior running back – a key player in Colorado State vs. Colorado on Saturday – initially found it.

Then lost it.

The fresh new scene, the new start quickly crumbled. As soon as he put on his old No. 34 jersey, trouble followed and lasted his first two CU seasons.

His son was injured in a car accident. His closest friend was murdered in Houston. A teammate, linebacker Brian Iwuh, suffered the death of his stepfather and brother in Houston and Vickers traveled home with a football signed by their Buffaloes teammates – and wound up in jail for seven days because of old traffic tickets. His father became ill from walking pneumonia. An aunt died of HIV. His program was caught in a recruiting and sex scandal. He was not playing his best football. His grades slumped.

So, before last season, Vickers sought another new vibe, another turnaround.

He changed his uniform from No. 34 to No. 17.

“I had been through a lot and one way to change it was to strip the worst from my life and skim things down, cut things in half,” Vickers said. “Some things I could not control but some I could. I could let my talent shine. I could be a better student. I could be a better leader for the team. I cut my number in half. And that’s why.”

His final season at CU gives him a chance to finish full, satisfied. It starts with Colorado State. Expect a physical, brutal game, Vickers said.

“It’s the first game of the year and we’re playing them?” Vickers said. “This game is going to have a lot of impact on a lot of people. What is your building point going to be?”

That is a fine question to ask CU’s offense. We know where it has been. Where is it going?

CU scored 319 points in 12 games two seasons ago and finished with a 5-7 record. It scored 304 points this past season even though it played one more game than in the season before. Though CU finished with an 8-5 record and bowl victory, the lack of scoring punch limited its rise.

Fans know CU employs a multiple offense, but where is the consistency, the production?

Vickers thinks it will be there this season. It is an experienced offense now, full of veterans.

As long as Vickers is part of the nucleus of this offense, I will buy it.

He can play fullback, tailback, receiver and even line up in the slot – V-back stands for versatility. He is 6-feet-2, 230 pounds, likes to pound, “but if it comes to that, I can outrun a couple of people.”

What I like about this player is his willingness to pitch his toughness, strength, will and passion into his play.

“I only fear God; I fear no player, no man,” Vickers said. “I’m into that Ray Lewis, Bill Romanowski stuff; I can get nasty, raw on the field. I get into that zone where I want to destroy something. I can block, run or catch it. I am a person who truly loves football. When we’re playing a team, I will take on the best player. I feel like a successful player has to be half animal out there; it’s required to succeed, to dominate.

“All eyes were on this team last year. People wanted to see how we were going to handle the situation with all of the criticism of the program. Everyone was looking to see what was going to happen to us. Last year we turned it around. It was a total turnaround.”

Vickers specializes in that.

Every football team needs a player like this, one who keeps things real, rugged and rough.

“Up until the minute I die, I will still be seeking to be great,” Vickers said. “We’re ready. We’re about to keep turning this thing around.”

The Denver Post,"In Colorado, he’s not a sexual predator","A sex offender convicted three times for exposing himself admits that he did so thousands of other times to young male victims at schools, malls and parks over the past 36 years.

As soon as he’s out from under monitoring by the Colorado Department of Corrections in October, the 47-year-old traveling salesman with HIV plans to return to public places to expose himself again.

“I am very angry. When I get real with myself, I realize how much I want to re-offend,” he said. “I haven’t found anything as powerful to get my needs met as that behavior.

“I have to admit that I will re-offend.”

The man lives in his home in virtual anonymity, free to go to his job and shop for groceries in local markets, ready to fulfill his promise.

His suburban Denver neighbors likely don’t know about his criminal past. And they probably won’t know unless they become suspicious and do some digging.

That’s because he doesn’t meet Colorado’s criteria for being identified as a sexually violent predator, a court-ordered designation that would mean officials would knock on his neighbors’ doors to warn them about his background and where he lives.

“He’s basically shooting a gun in a crowded theater,” said his therapist Greig Veeder, founder of Teaching Humane Existence, a Denver therapy program that treats 80 sex offenders.

Colorado, like most states, passed a community notification statute for sexually violent predators in 1999 to comply with Megan’s Law, a federal mandate named for a little girl in New Jersey who was raped and killed by a convicted child molester.

Although exposure to children is a qualifying offense under Colorado’s sexually violent predator law, this offender wasn’t evaluated as a predator because his three convictions came in the early 1990s. The notification law covers only convictions since 1999, and unlike the sexual-predator laws of other states, Colorado’s isn’t retroactive.

The Denver Post, through Veeder, learned of the sex offender being featured in this story. He agreed to be interviewed only on the condition of anonymity. Veeder said the offender agreed to do the story because he wants to do the right thing, “short of costing him his freedom.”

While the man has threatened to re-offend, there isn’t much the state can do, Veeder said, because his threats aren’t specific enough to revoke his sentence. He hasn’t named a specific victim.

“It’s an unactionable threat,” Veeder said. “It’s a certain uncertainty.”

One thing that is certain, the offender says, is that come October, he’s going to do what he has done for almost 36 years, only more carefully – stalk teenage victims.

His latest crime, stealing $100,000 from elderly clients in 2002, was not a sex offense. But he was required to abide by sex-offender restrictions while serving a community corrections sentence because of his earlier exposure convictions.

His court-ordered restrictions include attending sex-offender treatment and taking polygraph tests to confirm that he is not re-offending.

Because of the threat of going to prison, the sex offender said he has not exposed himself to anyone for a year – the first time he has gone that long since he was 11.

He said he started exposing himself after he began to feel rejected because he felt his homosexuality conflicted with his Christian beliefs. It was a way to find acceptance and to strike back at God and society, he said.

“I live my life in the pursuit of risk,” he said. “The high is so high.”

In therapy, he has come to recognize that his practice of having unprotected sex with strangers in bathhouses is another attempt to strike back at society.

“I use HIV as a weapon,” he said.

The sex offender said he’s biding his time until his sentence is complete, when he will be free to go where he wishes without restrictions. He knows he’ll soon be indulging in dangerous practices that could hurt his victims.

“I don’t know if I’m capable of understanding how dangerous I am and admitting it,” he said.

The Denver Post,Erasure strikes up the bland,"SYNTH-POP

“Nightbird”

Erasure

Mute

Poor Erasure has spent more than 10 years searching for its voice.

1991’s “Chorus” was its last truly full album, and while 1994’s “I Say I Say I Say” tried to recapture the inimitable spirit that dominated tracks from the late-’80s such as “Chains of Love,” it missed the mark. Erasure has poked at the popscape ever since with lackluster albums that don’t meet the high standards they set so early on.

“Nightbird” isn’t the Erasure of old, but it’s a sign of a new Erasure, matured and focused … and slightly boring. Released on the heels of vocalist Andy Bell’s admission that he is HIV-positive, the record has a somber but hopeful tone that never overwhelms. But it’s mostly down-tempo, which is unfortunate since the band hasn’t written a great ballad since “Ship of Fools.”

Erasure plays the Paramount Theatre on May 29. Tickets, $30-$35, are available via Ticketmaster.

ROCK

“Calling Up My Bad Side”

Weather

Cake Records

This aptly named Seattle band capitalizes on rock’s seemingly insatiable thirst for piano-driven sentimentality.

Singer Sean Campbell brings Dave Matthews-style introspection to his songwriting. The CD’s title track fuses Cake-sounding bass lines with a touch of indie-rock guitar chaos; every track features skillfully layered rhythms.

Strong melody is what this CD lacks. Campbell’s humane storytelling and delivery is engaging, particularly during “Falling Down.” But few songs leave the listener humming a tune once the CD is over.

Weather plays Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom on May 19. Tickets, $8-$10, 303-297-1772 or www.quixotes.com.

GARAGE ROCK

“Pretty in Black”

The Raveonettes

Columbia

There has never been a shortage of Phil Spector homages. But this one’s particularly good.

The wall of sound is there, of course, but so is the inherent sweetness that dominated so much of Spector’s music.

It’s obvious in the lo-fi take on “My Boyfriend’s Back,” but it’s also all over “Ode to L.A.,” which features Spector’s ex-wife, Ronnie Spector, on vocals and tastefully rips off multiple Phil Spector hits.

They stray a bit with the slooowed-down garage rockers “Red Tan” and “Somewhere in Texas,” both of which show vocalist Sune Rose Wagner’s songwriting growth.
